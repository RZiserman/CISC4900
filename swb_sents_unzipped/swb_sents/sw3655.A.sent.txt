So uh what do you think about child care

#s4
Right

#s6
Probably find someone

#s7
how come you would n't take them to a day-care

#s9
Just because of the

#s11
Yeah

#s12
they seem to pass a lot of

#s17
Yeah

#s18
you kind of wonder whether or not

#s23
I took uh Cammy to a

#s24
oh it was a preschool day-care type of thing

#s26
But I kind of I liked it some ways

#s27
and some ways I did n't

#s28
Uh I think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important

#s31
And

#s33
Well I think they had a they had two teachers

#s34
and I think there were twenty kids

#s35
but I only had her going two days

#s36
and most of the other kids were going more days

#s37
so that was probably my own fault that she did n't

#s40
Oh you know one thing I noticed is uh uh just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name

#s41
and uh I did n't notice it until this summer when I was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural sh- form

#s43
Yes

#s44
and uh I was kind of m- mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or or uh tried to say look you 're holding your

#s45
she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff

#s46
Sh- but she was

#s48
Yes

#s50
And uh I had n't worked with her on writing at all at that point

#s51
She was four or three

#s52
yeah

#s53
she was uh it was last year

#s54
and uh then this summer I got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on

#s55
and I w-

#s56
like I said I did n't notice it till then Because I had n't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that

#s60
No

#s62
They never

#s64
Course like I said I took her two days a week

#s65
and maybe that was

#s66
my main reason for taking her was uh just social skills more than anything else

#s69
I felt she needed the s-

#s70
just I did n't feel like she was mature enough socially

#s72
and uh

#s74
Uh-huh

#s75
Oh yeah

#s76
I think it would be hard to take them to people you do n't know

#s77
Preschool 's a different thing

#s78
but I think it 's hard to take kids to somebody you do n't know and or unless you have awfully good references Reliable uh people

#s81
I do n't know

#s82
it 's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long

#s85
It is

#s86
The older ones it 's not

#s87
you do n't even really have any real worries because you know that they 'll play with whoever 's there

#s88
and they usually adapt pretty well

#s90
But uh

#s93
Well and you know their kind of their schedules

#s94
and you know if they 're upset and that type of a deal

#s97
I do n't know how uh people uh that have young kids working work full time and and do it really without being stressed out all the time

#s98
I think it 's

#s99
well I do n't know

#s100
then then on the other hand I think it 's harder to stay home in some regards

#s101
It 's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you 're doing something productive

#s102
and at the end of the day your house still feels like it 's a mess

#s103
and you have n't got anything done

#s104
and

#s106
what am I going to fix for supper

#s109
Yeah

#s110
it 's kind of hard to always feel gosh what is this important what I 'm doing

#s111
and

#s114
No

#s116
No

#s117
it It does n't

#s120
But I think for taking kids to a probably people that take them to uh preschools and day-cares full time oh they would I do n't know probably just feel a different

#s121
uh I think I just think it would be hard to do that full time

#s122
I feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that

#s123
are they driving the baby-sitter crazy

#s124
and you know
