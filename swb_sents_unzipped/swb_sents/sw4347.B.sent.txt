Okay

#s2
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products

#s10
Uh-huh

#s14
I have n't had to

#s15
It 's uh the

#s16
every so often I mean I I I 'm almost pushing it myself

#s17
Maybe I 'll buy a shirt from G I Joe 's

#s18
and it shrinks too much

#s19
and say well I should have known better

#s20
I mean I bought it from G I Joe 's

#s22
and it was probably made in China by slaves

#s24
But uh they uh

#s25
most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway

#s26
I get pretty good stuff

#s28
I think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized

#s31
and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find

#s33
It 's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Yeah

#s43
Huh

#s45
Yeah

#s46
really

#s52
Yeah

#s53
I think they 're beginning to

#s54
The the days of do n't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away

#s55
and

#s57
Uh-huh

#s65
I know

#s66
Still at it

#s67
hey

#s70
Wow

#s75
Well they got a three year lead time

#s76
It probably wo n't start really showing up until ninety-four or so

#s81
The computer industry 's where it 's really dynamic especially for the consumer

#s85
And can you think of any other industry where

#s86
in software they

#s88
if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you 'll get a free version in the mail s- MUMBLEx

#s90
Or uh maybe I say well you know you paid five hundred bucks for this program

#s91
so send us twenty

#s92
and we 'll give you a really great upgrade

#s97
Yeah

#s99
And the hardware well I mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity

#s100
and the MacIntosh is about the only one that 's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along

#s106
Really

#s107
why do n't they just say almost a Mac for half the price

#s109
They 'd sell more if they were honest

#s113
Yeah it it 's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S MUMBLEx base

#s122
Uh-huh

#s124
Apple 's sort of making a

#s125
and they 're ones were

#s126
growling consumer uh need to worry about the Mac they 're getting

#s127
like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back

#s128
They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive

#s133
Yeah

#s134
I have one

#s135
I do desktop publishing at work

#s136
and I have a machine at home

#s137
and I belong to the user 's group

#s138
and I I 've been a Mac fanatic since they came out

#s141
But uh technically I 'm not actually in the industry

#s142
I do n't work a computer company

#s144
I 'm an abuser

#s146
But it 's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen

#s153
Yeah
