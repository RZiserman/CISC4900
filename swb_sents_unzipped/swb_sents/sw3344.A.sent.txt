Well let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we 've got going on

#s3
I have to agree with you there

#s4
I uh I think that uh for once we should we should n't even be at at these Mid East talks because with the exception of our hostages we really do n't have too much of a uh real in- we should n't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is

#s5
Just let these people fight it out

#s7
you know we 've got so many domestic problems

#s8
and and what does it cost these people over there you know

#s10
Oh so how about the Soviet Union

#s11
What do you think 's going to happen there

#s12
The break ups

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
That 's right

#s21
that 's right

#s26
Well all I 've seen

#s27
Reagan obviously was n't too concerned with the domestic side of of of his political affairs

#s28
I I think Bush 's kind of followed suit

#s29
Um international is important

#s30
but uh we 've got a budget deficit that just wo n't go away unless it gets seriously addressed

#s31
Uh you know and then there 's the homeless issue

#s32
and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without uh hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think

#s33
and we would n't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we 're spending

#s36
Right

#s39
I agree

#s40
We 've been writing off way too many bad debts uh country bad debts

#s41
Exactly

#s45
I know it

#s51
Right

#s55
That 's right

#s56
you 're either liberal or you 're conservative

#s58
Well I think uh it would n't hurt

#s59
and I know the Independent Party 's been trying for years to get a a a real force in in the uh in Congress

#s60
but uh you 're right

#s61
there 's just too many issues that come up that uh our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it 's a Democratic issue or it 's a Republican issue

#s63
and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel I think uh we might have a a lot better a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed

#s71
He 's one of the two huh

#s74
Well let 's see

#s75
Senators are in for six years right

#s77
and uh when did you guys vote him into office

#s79
Oh you 're stuck
