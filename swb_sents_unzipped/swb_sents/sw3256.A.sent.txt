#s1
Well I did hear the end of the prompt this time

#s2
Was that you that we did n't hear the whole prompt

#s5
And it said that what what do we do we think that cri- certain crimes should fit certain punishments

#s6
and uh I was thinking about it after I got off the phone that that I really you know wish that there was some way to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that

#s8
that uh

#s9
those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment

#s10
Too often I feel that people get off uh without

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s20
Right

#s21
right

#s23
Yeah

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Yeah

#s29
well sometimes they even wonder when when uh criminals plead temporary insanity for for punish- for crimes that are so severe and then you know they get sent to a mental institution

#s31
and they play loony for a while

#s32
and then they 're back out in public

#s35
Yeah

#s36
Yeah

#s37
oh I agree

#s38
I agree

#s39
because we

#s44
Uh-huh

#s45
Yeah

#s46
yeah

#s47
well and too you know they can always be blaming the other person

#s48
well she looked like my mother who abused me when I was a child or something which I think is unfortunate for that person and yet should n't be an excuse

#s51
I guess you know a lot of

#s52
and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved

#s53
and

#s55
Is that the new

#s56
I just happened to see the headline on it

#s57
and I did n't could n't realize if it was the husband or the father or what

#s58
but I thought uh you know if these things if children are being abused I I 'm wondering how our school system is failing that they 're not even seeing this you know

#s59
if it was that severe that when they 're later in life adults that it 's all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it was n't shown up at all when they were younger

#s60
and that kind of that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having you know to to deal with that yet

#s61
but still

#s64
Never

#s66
and I lived in California which I feel like California you know

#s68
anything can go on in California

#s73
Yeah

#s78
Uh-huh

#s79
uh-huh

#s84
I really would have no idea

#s85
I um I do n't do n't really know

#s88
Uh-huh

#s90
that would be pretty lenient in my opinion

#s97
Yeah

#s98
that 's that

#s99
or like when uh I 've heard when I
