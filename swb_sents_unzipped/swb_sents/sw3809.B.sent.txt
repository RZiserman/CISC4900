#s4
That

#s5
Right

#s6
Well they 've entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started

#s8
And uh I think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women

#s14
Right

#s20
Yeah

#s21
the

#s22
you see more of that you see more of them uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too

#s24
You know I I go to a I have a club that I belong to on Tuesday that

#s25
you know one of the girls travels quite extensively

#s26
and she says well my children have two parents

#s27
You know why not

#s30
So that that 's a I think that 's a change

#s31
and I think that 's a change you 're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father 's going to take more active role in child rearing

#s36
Right

#s39
No

#s40
That that I think should change will change in the near future also

#s43
It 's been changing

#s44
it 's been evolving

#s45
but there 's still a an an inequality in the work forces or jobs

#s47
It 's you know

#s49
And you hear some people say you know well he 's a man

#s50
he he he needs that salary

#s57
Right

#s61
And going

#s62
yeah

#s63
Uh-huh

#s67
Right

#s68
Yeah

#s69
I I think it will be

#s70
I think I well

#s71
an- another thing I read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they 're out there I guess is the car designers uh are starting to design cars with women in mind

#s72
Uh because in the past the male bought the cars but now they 're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases And that they are looking for uh different things in the car

#s74
The man is looking for the e- in the engine

#s75
and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel Uh can her makeup come off the upholstery

#s78
And if they 're out there buying that many cars then there 's that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working

#s88
Right

#s92
Yeah

#s93
we all do

#s95
I just happen to be off today

#s97

#s100
I 'm a nurse

#s102
And I work at Medical Treatment Center uh which is at Garl- uh Jupiter and Arapaho

#s105
No

#s108
I do n't know

#s109

#s111
