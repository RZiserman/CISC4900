#s1
Recently graduated from high school Meaning like uh you know three or four years ago

#s2
I 'm a senior in in uh college now

#s4
And uh I ca n't really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system I went to was uh really superb even though it was a public school system

#s10
Oh

#s11
Okay

#s12
Yeah

#s14
I got a friend who goes there by the way

#s15
I want to as- talk to you about that afterward

#s16
okay

#s22
Yeah

#s23
Yeah

#s24
It was a a it 's a more or less a suburban school system

#s26
Yes

#s27
That that was true for mine too

#s28
Uh although I I 'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity

#s29
but I do n't think I honestly do n't think that 's the biggest part of it

#s30
You know I think that uh I mean I know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they 're valued education

#s32
And uh you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn

#s35
I mean you know

#s40
Yeah

#s41
that 's true

#s42
But but uh I think I mean even more than that even I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know Which it MUMBLEx I mean it sounds like uh

#s46
now I think maybe it 's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory -tory tests if you have to take before you get a diploma

#s48
But uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read

#s49
Uh and that 's just sort of inexcusable

#s50
and you ca n't really

#s51
I I I mean I just ca n't even picture how that could happen You know except maybe to someone who 's you know really badly learning uh disabled or something

#s53
But these people obviously were n't

#s57
Yeah

#s59
Yeah

#s60
Yeah

#s62
Yeah

#s63
And I think that 's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably

#s64
I mean I do n't I think you know people just

#s67
Yeah

#s68
And again I do n't I mean

#s69
they got to know the you know how qualified I mean MUMBLEx

#s70
I think it 'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school Uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school You know just sort of to get a feel for what it 's like

#s74
I think that 'd be an interesting experience

#s75
But uh I have n't done that

#s79
But I do I do think that uh I mean public education in general I think can work

#s80
And I think it 's a good thing

#s83
Yeah

#s85
Yes

#s87
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s89
I mean I do n't I honestly do n't really think I could have you know done much better than I did in the school system I was in

#s90
I mean

#s95
Yeah

#s98
Yeah

#s99
I mean and and in the

#s100
once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels

#s101
Well no

#s102
I guess it wa- in junior high it was still three

#s103
Then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects Uh which

#s105
I mean actually I think that works pretty well

#s106
MUMBLEx and that that makes
