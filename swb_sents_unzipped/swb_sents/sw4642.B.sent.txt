#s6
Uh-huh

#s8
Yeah

#s10
So do you have a car

#s12
Do you have a car

#s14
Uh-huh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s23
Yeah

#s24
We used to have a Honda Accord

#s25
and they 're good

#s26
They 're really good cars

#s27
Every time I get taken to an auto repair place you know every time I go I get taken

#s28
Bad you know

#s30
Woman goes in

#s31
and they go all right we got a sucker

#s32
Let 's ge- see how much money we can get out of her you know

#s34
That 's what happens every time

#s36
Uh so

#s38
I have a Pontiac Six Thousand

#s40
Yeah

#s41
But our Honda just got old and just wore out

#s42
It was let 's see eleven years old

#s43
and it just just out of it

#s44
so No

#s46
huh-uh

#s47
My hu- uh ex-husband 's

#s48
this is just happened a couple of weeks ago

#s49
He 's my ex-husband

#s50
but just a few months ago when he was my husband uh his father gave us this car

#s51
and everything is wrong with it

#s52
I mean the power steering fluid leaks

#s53
the oil leaks

#s54
the brake fluid leaks you know

#s57
Uh eighty-seven

#s59
And he just does n't take care of things

#s60
and but I was awarded the car

#s61
so There is a man in my church that is a mechanic

#s62
and I can trust him

#s63
So he is trying to get you know things fixed on it

#s65
But it 's just you know leak leak leak everywhere

#s66
But uh you know I hate to go into a a repair place because they 'll tell me something is wrong with it and it 's not you know and charge me twice as much

#s67
The last time I took it into a repair shop the man told me I needed a master cylinder

#s68
So I said okay

#s69
And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars

#s70
and then uh about a month later a man was looking at my car

#s71
and he asked me you know

#s72
not a man not a repair man but just a friend

#s73
and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on

#s74
and he looked at

#s75
and he said that 's not a new master cylinder

#s77
and I did n't even know what one was

#s78
And uh he showed it to me

#s79
and it was old rusty just awful

#s80
It was no more new than nothing

#s82
Uh more than likely

#s85
That was it probably

#s86
It was ve-

#s87
I was so irritated

#s88
And that 's happened to me more than once or twice Jus- just just about every time I 've went in somewhere

#s91
And and you ju- can hardly find one you know

#s93
The guy that 's doing most of my my car now uh goes to my church

#s94
and that 's the only reason you know I go to him because I know him

#s96
and I know he will tell me the truth

#s97
Because he does n't even charge me for for doing it

#s98
so he 's not going to you know take me

#s100
I just pay for the parts

#s101
and he does it

#s102
so

#s104
Yeah

#s106
Yeah

#s107
I am

#s108
so I do n't know

#s109
I do n't know what the solution to that is

#s110
because the place where you buy your car they 're usually the worst one of all

#s111
We took our Honda to the Honda dealership

#s112
and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car

#s114
Yeah

#s115
And so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars

#s116
we you know they told us we just had to have one

#s117
and we bought one

#s118
We did n't no more need no new engine

#s119
give me break you know

#s121
So it was it was not good

#s122
and uh
