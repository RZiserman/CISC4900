What what do you feel is the the major change that 's been going on

#s6
I think that has been the major change is that women feel they need to go out and do this

#s7
they they no longer feel it 's uh it 's no big deal to to stay home and raise your family any more

#s9
I know it

#s10
and I I think I think that 's really sad because I think there 's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else

#s14
You do n't

#s15
well

#s16
I 'm I 'm still home with with my last one

#s17
and I would n't trade change a minute of it for anything

#s20
But I I ca n't I ca n't help but think that eventually the pendulum 's going to swing back the other way again

#s23
Uh-huh

#s26
Oh yeah

#s27
that 's

#s29
Yeah

#s30
it it 's sad

#s32
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s38
I I think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary

#s40
uh you know to

#s41
I I do n't think you know the kids do n't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and and and this type of thing

#s42
I think that they would from the you know attention or whatever

#s44
uh but it

#s45
I uh I I do n't know

#s46
I I see it as a major problem

#s47
and I think it 's going to have to swing back the other way because I think we 're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this

#s50
Uh-huh

#s55
What what grade do you teach

#s57
Six seven and eight

#s58
I 've got a chi- uh

#s59
where do you live

#s60
Are you out

#s62
In Richardson

#s63

#s65
I have a daughter in middle school

#s66
and uh I know there are n't very many

#s67
she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home

#s68
but do you see um you know do you ever do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are left alone too much

#s70
and

#s73
He stays at school

#s75
And the school allows that

#s77
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s82
Oh my

#s84
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s92
No mother to talk to

#s96
Well I 've

#s97
do you do you feel it will swing back the other way

#s98
or do you feel there 's just going to be a big push to uh you know for for more more and more day care type situations

#s109
Uh-huh

#s113
Yeah
