Well what 's your favorite baseball team Rita

#s5
Well that is n't a a true false or right or wrong test here

#s11
Not a Cubbies fan huh

#s16
Well that 's all right

#s18
How do you expect them to do this year

#s21
Okay

#s23
Well I 'll tell you

#s24
I just uh moved down from South Dakota in July

#s25
and uh in South Dakota the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living

#s27
and so everybody was a Twins fan

#s28
and I was kind of uh did n't have much interest in the Twins you know

#s29
it was it was kind of pathetic

#s30
I mean we only had two radio stations

#s31
and one of them broadcast every Twins game live you know

#s32
and the other one was country

#s34
So that 's right

#s35
There 's was Twins there or you know Skip Williams

#s42
It sure was

#s43
it sure was

#s45
Well I I would like to a- a- assume that they 're going to do do better this coming year

#s47
I was sure hopeful anyway

#s48
When we moved down uh I was able to go to my first you know baseball game and thought this is great

#s49
this is incredible

#s51
So I became a Rangers fan

#s52
I did n't really have one in South Dakota

#s53
So I adopted the Rangers

#s54
or rather they adopted me I guess

#s56
and uh it was just exciting you know

#s57
you can watch baseball on T V

#s58
and they hit the long ball

#s59
and it looks like wow they really hit that ball

#s60
But when you go to the ball park it 's really not all that far you know

#s62
and it 's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you

#s63
and

#s66
That 's right

#s67
that 's right

#s73
The Restaurant Ha-

#s76
Huh

#s78
Right

#s82
That 's right

#s84
and he 's still doing great still doing excellent

#s88
Well did n't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers

#s92
Management

#s93
Right

#s95
That 's right

#s97
You know some of the

#s98
like uh Ivan Rodriguez was n't even born when when uh Nolan Ryan started pitching

#s100
And it 's just incredible to think that there 's uh there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan you know

#s102
and now their sons are

#s108
Uh-huh

#s109
I was n't

#s114
Was it Nolan against uh

#s115
Ryan against Ryan huh

#s119
Well that is neat

#s121
Uh-huh

#s124
Right
