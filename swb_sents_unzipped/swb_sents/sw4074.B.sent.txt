#s3
Oh we have one rotten cat

#s5
Yeah

#s6
it 's my son 's cat

#s8
Yeah

#s9
that 's the boys

#s10
They know I do n't like it

#s12
Well I like cats

#s13
This this cat is a uh more like a dog

#s15
Yeah

#s16
he 's uh a one owner

#s17
He likes one boy in the family

#s18
and that 's about it

#s21
Just uh stays away or runs usually

#s23
But he follows he 'll follow my oldest son around

#s24
You know when he is in the house he will come up

#s25
and he 'll jump on his lap

#s26
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he 'll just kind of look at them like what are doing

#s28
He 's he we bought the cat for him

#s29
and so he 's uh been the one that you know spent the most time with him

#s30
But I I 've never owned a cat like that

#s31
I 've had cats growing up all the time

#s32
and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody

#s35
So it 's a weird cat

#s37
A mutt

#s39
Uh-huh

#s42
Oh

#s45
Uh-huh

#s51
Uh-huh

#s53
So that is that is that kind of your child right now

#s56
You feel like

#s60
Oh uh-huh

#s62
Have have you had dogs before

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Yeah

#s71
Well I just uh we 've you know

#s72
when I was growing up I had we always had a dog

#s73
and we had mostly mutts

#s74
well not mutts but mixes you know like one or two mix

#s76
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
Uh-huh

#s83
Yeah

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
No

#s89
No

#s90
it 's just uh an accident

#s91
From a frie- uh from my my son 's friend down the street

#s92
They 're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens

#s94
and so

#s96
Uh we I would

#s97
We uh we had a dog that was a uh mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador

#s99
and I should say a pup

#s100
and he was just too big for our kids when we got him

#s102
and we when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet

#s103
and it was a dog that we gotten

#s104
and he was he was just too big

#s106
Uh the kids could n't handle him

#s107
and I was still going to school

#s108
and my wife was working

#s109
and I was working

#s110
and so we just did n't have time to really train him

#s111
so he was kind of jus- you know he was too big for the kids to handle

#s112
so he was just tied up to a post

#s114
so we gave him to uh

#s115
I do n't know if you 've

#s116
there is a place out here uh called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville

#s118
and they have uh

#s119
I guess it 's kind of an animal shelter

#s120
but he just takes a few the animals in

#s121
and some he destroys

#s122
and some he keeps

#s124
So we took him up there

#s125
and he ended up keeping him

#s126
Uh cause he has had him for six or seven years

#s127
We we 've saw him just about a year ago

#s128
and uh I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away

#s130
and so we asked him about it one day

#s131
and he said yeah

#s132
he 's been the best dog I 've ever had in my life

#s134
just goes everywhere with him

#s135
I he would have been a great great dog
