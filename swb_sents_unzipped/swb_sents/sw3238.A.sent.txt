Hello

#s3
Hi

#s5
My name 's Gail

#s6
I 'm calling from Texas

#s9
Oh what a deal

#s10
Took long enough to find you

#s12
Yeah

#s13
seems like they take forever any more

#s14
but um so did you hear what the topic was

#s16
did she tell you

#s17
okay

#s19
Great

#s20
well if you 're ready then uh I 'll just go ahead and start

#s22
Okay

#s23
hold on

#s24
Okay

#s25
well I guess we 're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women

#s27
Seems like um to me everything is just changing so much that it 's almost like um you ca n't keep up with things any more

#s28
and everything is uh ther- everyone 's striving so much to make it equal between men and women

#s29
I personally I 'm a stay home mom

#s30
and I like it the way it used to be

#s32
Are you

#s36
Yeah

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
Yeah

#s44
Ho- how many kids do you have

#s46
Two

#s48
Are they young

#s49
or

#s51
Five and two

#s52
I have two

#s53
and mine are two and nine months

#s54
so um being being home is real

#s55
I I just am fortunate because I do n't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home

#s56
and uh I just it 's just weird that I was just talking to somebody this morning who 's who 's a working uh lady a working mom

#s57
and you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs

#s58
and it just seems like um

#s59
she she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care

#s60
and uh I just think I I I just do n't agree with that

#s61
I think it should be that people should get back to staying home and and being family more family oriented than than not

#s62
You know it seems like everybody 's always so busy with everything that they 're doing that there 's no time for this and that and the other

#s63
and I hope it just does n't get to where you know there 's more women more and more women going into the work force

#s66
Yeah

#s68
Uh-huh

#s71
Yeah

#s72
well I find that I whenever I have to whenever I 'm in a group of people and we 're discussing things

#s73
like just over the weekend I visited my family and some cousins I had n't seen in a long time

#s74
and everyone 's all interested in what everybody 's doing

#s75
and uh you know well I had my baby with me

#s76
and I found that all I talked about was my baby which was fine with me

#s77
but it 's like you know here these people are

#s78
they 're going to school getting degrees making all this money

#s79
and you know they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages you know like I because I did n't have really all that much to talk about uh where career and things like that were concerned

#s80
and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes

#s82
which is too bad because you know I I feel like I do n't obviously I do n't get paid for my job

#s83
but I should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home

#s85
that 's what I figure

#s86
I 'm worth a lot just for what I do every day

#s87
but you know I do n't know

#s88
this is kind of a um

#s89
at at least here I 've noticed

#s90
I 'm not from here

#s91
I 'm from Colorado

#s92
but I 've really noticed that there are a lot of uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and at least in the circles I 've travelled and in the church that I go to you know

#s93
that

#s94
men do n't treat you like you do n't know anything generally speaking

#s98
Yeah

#s105
Yeah

#s106
yeah

#s107
I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem

#s108
definitely

#s109
Well
