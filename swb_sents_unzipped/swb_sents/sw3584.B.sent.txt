#s2
Okay

#s3
Uh right now we 're living in

#s4
well it 's me my wife and uh two young boys

#s5
And uh right now we 're in a uh I guess it 's either a zero lot line or a garden home Which you might call it

#s7
So we do n't have a a big yard

#s8
Uh

#s9
but uh when my wife and I first moved in it was just the two of us

#s10
So it was enough

#s12
Uh and it 's uh I guess what they call a story and a half Because it 's not a full two story Where you know everything on top is on bottom

#s14
So it 's got real high ceilings on half the house

#s15
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings

#s17
And uh it 's about a five year old house now

#s19
It 's uh pretty nice

#s20
Unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already

#s22
Yeah

#s23
It was a

#s24
Landmark is the one who built it

#s27
Yeah

#s28
That 's true

#s30
Exactly what happened to them

#s32

#s122
Yeah

#s125
Wow

#s127
My wife would love that

#s130
She loves lots of windows

#s131
That 's great

#s133
Is it a single story

#s136
Oh I see

#s139
Uh-huh

#s140
Um I see

#s142
Oh

#s144
Yeah

#s146
Uh-huh

#s147
Yeah

#s148
that 's kind of like like a Victorian style

#s150
Yeah

#s151
I I 've always liked that

#s152
The you know

#s153
I we do n't have much yard

#s154
but I built a small deck in the back

#s156
But you know I I see these magazines where you know dig your your own deck

#s158
I I kind of wish I had them those size property and and uh one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck
