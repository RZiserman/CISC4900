So Have you heard about Saturns

#s5
Ooh that 's great

#s6
Actually that 's kind of the type of car that I I 'm thinking about we might get

#s7
Saturns you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to a a Saturn dealer This this offshoot of G M

#s10
And uh supposedly they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things I 've heard

#s17
Well like what

#s23


#
Yeah

#s28
Yeah

#s29
I 've got a sixty-five Mustang

#s30
and I and I do the work on most of the work on that myself

#s33
And when I look at modern cars and stuff like I just say I will never do that with the modern cars

#s34
It 's not worth my time

#s35
You ca n't get in there

#s36
You ca n't do anything

#s38
And it 's so complicated too

#s39
I look at it

#s40
and I say boy you know

#s41
I I 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that

#s43
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Yeah

#s54
Yeah

#s57
Yeah

#s58
That 's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about

#s59
Actually the car one of the cars we 'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they 're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags

#s62
Yeah

#s64
Uh-huh

#s71
Yeah

#s75
Ninety

#s76
yeah

#s77
Or excuse me the ninety-twos

#s78
The ninety-twos had dual air bags

#s80
This newest model You could get them with duals

#s83
Yeah

#s84
But the thing is that it 's twenty thousand dollars

#s85
Actually my my wife and I are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so

#s86
So we 're actually been looking around and thinking about things

#s88
We 'd like to get like a

#s89
oh I do n't know

#s90
What do you call it

#s91
A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know

#s93
Year old ninety-two or something like that

#s97
See if we

#s100
And the other thing we 're looking at is the Saturns too

#s102
Because they looked really nice

#s109
Well the Saturns you can get air bags in them

#s110
I do n't think you can get dual side air bags

#s112
But one of the the two things that I 'm really

#s113
the I 'd say the most important thing is a car that 's not going to fall apart That does n't have problems

#s115
You set down

#s116
You look at consumer reports

#s117
We 've been pouring over consumer reports

#s118
and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that

#s120
Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have

#s121
and and the two cars that apparently are close to that That actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars

#s123
And the other one is are the Saturns

#s125
So those two things

#s126
And then you know we kind of want a four door
