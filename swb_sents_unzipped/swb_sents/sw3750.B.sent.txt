#s1
Yeah

#s4
Oh yeah

#s6
I uh like you I have n't done any in quite some time except for what I call living now which is which is very close to camping

#s12
Yeah

#s13
You know I uh camped in the Boy Scouts

#s14
and you know my dad and I went out sometimes

#s15
but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction

#s18
And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress

#s20
I mean when you have to have it you have got to have it

#s22
And you know in those those kinds of situations uh room rent which is outrageous

#s25
So my buddy and I we just camped

#s27
And we figured what the hell

#s28
we did it when we were kids

#s29
and we loved it

#s31
Of course we did n't really rough it that much

#s32
When when I was in high school

#s33
he is a couple years older than me

#s34
and uh he graduated and went off to college

#s35
and uh during the summer we would camp out at the lake

#s37
But it was n't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove

#s39
You know I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine

#s41
And uh well it was fantastic

#s42
We would get up in the morning go skiing uh

#s43
that substituted for a shower

#s45
and then we would go to work and uh come back to the uh you know boat house at night

#s46
and uh in the afternoon you know it is still four o'clock

#s47
You have got four hours of day light good skiing left

#s49
And uh it was great

#s51
But uh you know now all my life is more like camping than not camping really

#s54
Oh yeah

#s57
Well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago

#s59
We did n't have a phone

#s61
They did n't have phone lines

#s62
You just could n't get phones

#s64
And uh we are on the we are third from the end on the electric string

#s66
So we are at the end of the mail route

#s68
Like I said we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas

#s71
But uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and I is we got a mobile home One of these twelve by forty-eight 's that got repoed And uh swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day you know

#s75
I 'm in construction

#s76
and uh you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here you know putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know

#s78
And uh I came home from work one Friday afternoon

#s79
and our truck was back

#s80
Everything we had was in boxes

#s81
and my wife said uh we 're moving

#s83
And I said where

#s84
And she said out to the trailer

#s85
And I said oh

#s86
She said yep

#s87
and I said okay

#s89
So we have been roughing it out here for about three years

#s90
but it is not bad

#s91
I we have color T V microwave you know

#s93
it is not horrible

#s94
but it 's it 's a lot like camping

#s98
Uh-huh

#s99
Uh-huh

#s104
Sure

#s107
Became civilized

#s110
Yeah

#s111
my mom goes camping you know

#s112
She takes her uh motor home

#s113
You know she 's got one of these huge Winnebago 's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning color T V microwave oven you know

#s115
She just

#s116
roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower You know

#s118
But you know she has a lot of fun

#s120
And mostly it is just a way to

#s121
she she goes to dog shows

#s123
See she shows dogs

#s124
and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel

#s126
but you ca n't sneak ten dogs into a motel

#s128
So she uh you know takes the motor home

#s129
And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing

#s131
And she

#s132
if he would buy her a motor home

#s133
So he did

#s135
But as far as camping my wife and I have plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the uh you know Highway One there in California uh as soon as we get this house finished

#s139
I am going to need a vacation
