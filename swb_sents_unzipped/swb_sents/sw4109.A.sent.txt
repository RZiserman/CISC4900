Uh guy uh some of my things I I 'd like to have a short work week you know

#s3
and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cau-

#s7
Okay

#s9
Okay

#s10
Okay

#s11
so I just press one then right

#s13
Okay

#s14
ready

#s16
Okay

#s20
Well well right now I I 'm just a student

#s21
I only work part time

#s22
but I 've work in the job force before

#s24
and forty hours is just too long

#s25
You just do n't have any time to do anything

#s26
It seems like Saturday you get get off but Sunday you 're getting ready for Monday

#s27
And if we get have a if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job

#s30
And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday okay

#s31
And that way that more that would make a bigger market

#s32
We 'd have uh more recreation

#s33
People would have time to do it

#s34
There would be less of a stress level

#s35
We 'd have we 'd have less crime

#s36
We 'd have to we 'd have to build less prisons you know less police force

#s42
It it that 's that 's a possibility

#s44
One one of the problems they 're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance is that the small business ca n't ca n't offer health insurance

#s46
and it it 's too costly

#s47
and what what is happening is that they 're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it okay

#s48
So they get a specific rate

#s49
Well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and and things like that

#s50
what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular

#s52
it 's called a a group

#s53
well what will well what happens then is that they cancel because they just ca n't cancel an individual

#s54
So they they have to cancel just like life insurance

#s55
They have to cancel everything

#s57
So what they do is that that they cancel the insurance

#s58
and then all the people do n't have any insurance coverage

#s61
But I 'm I 'm you know I 'm I 'm satisfied with my job

#s62
I 'm I 'm an engineering student

#s64
And I work for my instructor

#s65
and I 'm I 'm not a typical student

#s66
I 'm I 'm older

#s67
I 'm I 'm in my thirties okay

#s69
And so I have a lot of job experience

#s70
and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants

#s71
and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose

#s73
but in in the same token it 's a very really enjoyable for me because I do n't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back

#s74
and and one of the things that I I really hate about jobs I do n't I do n't like bosses that that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that

#s76
I I just really ca n't deal with that

#s77
so

#s79
What kind of what kind of jobs have you done

#s83
Uh-huh

#s92
Yeah

#s93
that 's just great

#s94
You have what you might call knowledge power

#s96
you know when when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you 're categorized

#s97
Some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist

#s98
But if you 're a person who that 's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you 've revised and revamped the system well then you 're you 're vital to the company

#s100
and you get more benefits

#s101
so That 's where I I I 'm like

#s102
I 'm into computers too

#s103
and that 's one of the things that I 've found in any one one of these jobs and anything I 've done is that to have knowledge

#s104
When you have the knowledge you 're you 're not going to uh you know be let go

#s105
be one of the last ones to let go anyway

#s107
So what I
