Hi

#s2
my name is Donna

#s3
and I 'm calling calling from Plano Texas

#s5
Oh okay um

#s6
I um find exercise kind of a task I guess I 'd say

#s7
I go to aerobics two days a week

#s8
but I also have three kids at home

#s9
so they keep me pretty busy

#s11
Yeah

#s12
that gives me plenty of exercise

#s13
but I enjoy um walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family

#s14
Excuse me

#s15
fine

#s16
And yourself

#s21
Uh-huh

#s22
every morning

#s23
Well my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing

#s26
yeah

#s27
he does it every day like a ritual

#s28
Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he um someone invites him to lunch he 'll he 'll not go

#s29
but he goes um every every day

#s30
and then he ru- he 's a runner too

#s31
He runs three mornings a week

#s32
he gets up about five and and does his his deal

#s34
and some days he does n't

#s35
but then maybe he 'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run

#s37
And um we MUMBLEx

#s42
Oh

#s43
The the the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here

#s44
and I know um uh we we both of my husband and I both do it to just keep the pounds off

#s45
We 're getting up in age I guess in our late thirties

#s46
so we need to keep exercising just to be able to uh

#s53
Oh I know

#s56
Yeah

#s57
I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week

#s58
and I take my three year old with me

#s59
There 's a nursery there

#s60
And it 's kind of another day out for her to um have little friends

#s62
and um I I enjoy the socialization of it you know getting to see the same women every morning

#s64
but um there are some parts during that exercise that I think I can not do another second of this

#s67
It is

#s71
That 's true

#s72
that 's true

#s74
Well

#s76
Okay well

#s78
