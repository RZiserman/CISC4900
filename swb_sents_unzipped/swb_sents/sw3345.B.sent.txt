#s2
Um somewhat

#s3
Yeah

#s5
Not

#s6
not as well as I would like to probably

#s8
but that 's the way it goes

#s11
What

#s13
Um State College

#s14
I go to Penn State

#s17
Yep

#s22
Right

#s23
exactly uh

#s28
I see

#s30
Well what particularly are you interested in

#s34
Uh-huh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s41
Yeah

#s43
I see

#s45
Uh-huh

#s49
Um uh well some of both

#s51
I read I read the newspapers sometimes

#s53
and I watch C N N that sort of thing occasionally

#s57
and I read magazines and such

#s59
Well yeah

#s60
I mean not not that badly anyway

#s62
so I am I am interested in what 's going on

#s63
and I 'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about Haiti recently because I 've been down there

#s68
and yeah

#s70
Right

#s71
exactly

#s76
Yep

#s78
Uh-huh

#s82
That 's true

#s83
They 've never really had a good leader

#s85
Uh-huh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s89
Yeah

#s92
Oh yeah

#s96
Uh-huh

#s98
I see

#s99
Uh-huh

#s103
Yeah

#s104
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America

#s107
Uh-huh

#s113


#
right

#s118
Yep

#s121
Uh-huh

#s123
Yeah

#s124
well you know I think it probably could be it always could be better

#s125
but I would agree that it 's pretty good

#s128
Yeah

#s130
Um

#s132
Yeah

#s133
well I think that um

#s134
I do n't know

#s136
The um

#s137
Right

#s139
Right

#s140
I think that

#s142
Well that may be so

#s143
yeah

#s145
I think that I 'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such

#s151
Right

#s153
Uh-huh

#s154
Right
