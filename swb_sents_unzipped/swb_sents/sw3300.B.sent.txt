#s1
All right

#s2
so we started recording already

#s6
Oh so you pressed one

#s8
Okay

#s9
So I guess we 're supposed to start talking

#s10
Uh what kind of books do you read

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
So it 's mostly all novels

#s19
Okay

#s21
Oh like what

#s24
Yeah

#s25
I like that

#s26
I like Steinbeck a lot

#s28
I have never read a lot of Faulkner

#s31
Oh cool

#s34
I 'm Doug

#s35
I 'm from Pennsylvania

#s39
Uh well a bunch of stuff I guess uh fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones

#s40
And like I do n't really like the you know six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that

#s42
Right

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
No

#s47
like I like say uh Richard Broudigan a lot

#s48
Uh

#s50
Okay

#s51
He 's uh he 's dead now

#s52
but he was really a pretty amazing writer

#s53
He wrote books that were like pretty short and pretty easy to read you know like written at a third grade level or whatever

#s55
But they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny

#s56
Like He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA

#s58
So that 's

#s59
anyway and uh I read a lot of non fiction books too

#s60

#s100
