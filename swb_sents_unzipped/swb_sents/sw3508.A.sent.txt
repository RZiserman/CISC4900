#s1
I guess we 're supposed to talk about what 's being done about recycling

#s3
Well lots right

#s5
Finally

#s8
Well we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the uh Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have uh had a huge recycling bin over at Resurrection Lutheran Church

#s12
and uh so we 've done that for quite some time

#s13
but since the price of paper has gone down

#s14
like it 's about a fifth of what it used to be

#s16
so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over

#s18
So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano

#s19
Do you live in Plano

#s22
Okay

#s23
yeah

#s26
Right

#s28
Yes

#s30
Although just just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that uh work in the library for me said they had n't gotten theirs

#s33
Yeah

#s35
Yeah

#s36
yeah

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
Right

#s40
yeah

#s41
we used to take ours there

#s44
I know

#s47
Right

#s49
Right

#s50
I 'm really glad they do it

#s51
Uh yeah

#s52
I do news mostly newspapers and uh plastic two liter diet Coke bottles And aluminum cans some

#s55
but I do n't use as many of those

#s57
I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really that are really dirty that you have to wash out

#s60
Uh ha

#s64
Wasting all your time and effort and Putting it in there

#s66
Yeah

#s67
yeah

#s69
Got your routine down

#s70
Yeah

#s72
Well I guess there are some places uh in the north in particular that uh have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle

#s73
because they charge you let 's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight

#s75
So if you recycle things of course then you do n't have all that weight in there

#s78
Right

#s79
That 's right

#s80
Yeah

#s81
Yeah

#s86
Um

#s87
Right

#s89
Yeah

#s90
right

#s92
Probably going to throw them in your trash

#s96
Well there are places that take car batteries

#s97
but I wonder if they would take

#s99
I mean not that it would

#s100
kind of a pain to you know drive over somewhere special just for that for two little tiny batteries

#s101
but

#s105
Yeah

#s106
that 's true

#s109
Right

#s110
that 's true

#s111
Uh when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the uh the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we 'd never really seen it pick up our stuff

#s113
and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff

#s116
and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it

#s117
so I do n't know why what that was reading it for

#s119
but uh

#s121
they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what I guess

#s123
I do n't know

#s124
Another

#s126
Ooh for those who are really cooperating

#s128
Now that would encourage it

#s132
Sure

#s134
Sure

#s136
But the garbage uh

#s137
now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two

#s140
So that 's interesting

#s141
Uh also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen

#s143
Uh-huh

#s145
And we c- we called the City

#s146
and uh they they brought us a new one

#s147
and they did not charge us

#s148
And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen

#s150
Is n't that sad You know

#s152
And just

#s155
Oh and they must be Yeah really expensive

#s157
I mean of course we were hoping we were n't we were n't going to have to pay for it you know

#s159
but I mean what would somebody do with them
