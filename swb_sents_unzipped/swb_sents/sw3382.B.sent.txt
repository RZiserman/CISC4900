#s4
Uh-huh

#s5
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
Have you been following the uh the progress of the MUMBLEx space health code

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s17
Yeah

#s18
I think it 's pretty exciting that they can uh

#s19
it would be interesting to see if they can find uh other planets that are that will be more habitable to uh you know uh humans

#s20
and uh yeah

#s21
I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if uh if it you know if it is at all possible

#s26
Well I know if they make the advances that they have been making that uh maybe age will no longer age or even physical uh abilities may not be uh a barrier anymore

#s31
Yeah

#s32
I agree

#s33
Uh as a matter of fact we 're the ones that

#s34
I have been to Houston to to you know to visit the uh space center out there

#s35
and uh one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro

#s37
and uh that vacuum uh little space program was one of the big you know backers of that

#s39
It 's amazing you know

#s40
you

#s41
it 's hard to imagine what life was like without it now

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
yeah

#s48
I 've h- seen him before

#s50
Yeah

#s51
Yo- we were talking about that just the other day

#s52
What did we do without it back then

#s54
I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps

#s61
That 's right

#s62
That 's right

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
That 's true

#s68
Uh-huh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
Yeah

#s75
Yeah

#s76
that that is uh that is something that would be hard to think about

#s77
I agree

#s78
You know like you say we 're used to finite things

#s79
and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible

#s82
But uh yeah

#s83
I would like to see them uh do more in that area to make space travel more uh something that the ordinary person can uh en- enjoy

#s86


#
Yeah

#s89
Yeah

#s90
me too

#s91
I would n't even mind being not so much being first but just uh get out there and and just explore

#s93
I think uh it 's in everyone 's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they have n't or experience something you know indifferent

#s96
Oh sure

#s97
Sure

#s98
Of course

#s99
That 's true

#s103
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s106
that 's true

#s112
Yeah

#s114
That 's right

#s115
That 's right

#s116
And if you are just content with being you know with the way things are then you know then you must lead lead a pretty dull life

#s118
Because if yo-

#s121
Uh-huh

#s123
Yeah

#s124
I guess uh you do n't really think about it too much

#s125
I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff

#s126
but yo-

#s127
it it 's in a subconscious you know thing

#s128
You know somewhere they can sit down and write down what you know things that you 've improved upon

#s129
you probably would n't have a pretty good list

#s131
But you just do n't think about them

#s133
And that 's true

#s134
I think uh you know

#s135
we 've gotten different programs at work you know to to uh make it visible to management that we are doing things better
