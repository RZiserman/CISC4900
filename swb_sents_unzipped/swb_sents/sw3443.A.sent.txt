#s1
Surprised they get anybody this time of day

#s2
but I 've been trying all different times

#s4
but I do n't get anybody at five thirty do n't get anybody at nine at night

#s5
so thought I 'll try MUMBLEx

#s8
Oh

#s10
Oh

#s11
Well I go to school

#s12
so I 'm home certain days

#s14
and uh I really have n't been making any s- phone calls have you

#s15
Got

#s18
Oh

#s19
Have you have you received many

#s21
Yeah

#s23
It 's it 's uh

#s24
well the first time we were on this it came just about every day

#s26
I never had to make one

#s27
They just always came

#s30
People must be tired of it or something

#s31
W- well anyway I guess we 're supposed to discuss this uh subject

#s32
what do you think

#s35
Oh

#s36
Well I do n't have any objection to people doing that

#s37
I think it might be good for them

#s39
But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent

#s41
I 'm just concerned about their safety mor-

#s43
because if they do good work in America they 'll probably be sent to a ghetto

#s46
And if they were sent to a third world country I could n't help but wait worried you know

#s49
That that would be my main objection

#s50
Uh I do n't think

#s54
it will probably never happen

#s55
but

#s60
Yeah

#s61
well it it probably wo n't

#s63
I do n't I do n't even know how we 'd pay for it anyway

#s64
We ca n't uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now

#s67
That 's another consideration

#s69
But uh I do n't know

#s70
som- some kids are so spoiled nowadays

#s71
it might be a real eye opener you know

#s73
I mean sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here

#s74
and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes

#s75
and then they think

#s76
they 're just kind of shocked at that side of town you know

#s79
I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl

#s81
Oh

#s82
Well that would be an eye opener would n't it

#s84
I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country

#s87
I know

#s88
Sometimes I wish we 'd help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries I never even heard of

#s92
It seems to me we are

#s93
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country Right on our borders

#s97
But what do I know right

#s98
I 'm just sitting at home and and uh doing laundry today and certainly not up

#s99
nobody has called me from Washington

#s100
Oh but uh anyway how did you get on this program

#s102
Oh you do work at T I

#s103
Oh you 're in Lewisville

#s105
Oh yeah

#s106
I just went by that place

#s107
We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost

#s108
and uh we went by

#s109
That 's the first time I 'd seen it

#s110
It looked really nice

#s112
A lot of trees there

#s113
It looked like a pretty little a sight

#s115
Sure

#s121
Oh sure

#s122
Di-

#s124
Well my husband works at T I over on Central

#s126
Uh why we 're living in Arlington I 'm not so sure

#s127
but he works over there

#s128
and tha-

#s129
we did it last time

#s131
And uh so  just my daughter and I are registered this time

#s132
I do n't know

#s133
they did n't even ask him back

#s135
That was weird was n't it

#s137
But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time

#s140
And I can never find anybody

#s142
So um

#s144
Right

#s146
Uh-huh

#s148
Yeah

#s149
I 've had the same experiences

#s151
all right around here

#s153
Yeah

#s154
I do n't know uh

#s155
I wonder if they really

#s156
I do n't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents

#s157
There 's just there 's so many with this one town you know

#s160
E- even in some families some people talk a little bit different

#s163
My husband is from New Jersey

#s164
and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me

#s165
and he does n't pronounce them at all that way

#s166
and that 's one family right

#s167
Of course I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny

#s168
but

#s170
You know how that goes

#s172
Oh God

#s173
Well I 'm surprised she has n't told us to cut it off yet

#s174
Sometimes she says at night

#s175
Or or switc- or overloads

#s177
so please end your conversation

#s180
Right

#s181
Well do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject

#s184
You do n't have any kids you want to send over here

#s187
Well MUMBLEx is

#s189
Well uh I do n't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto

#s190
Well one of them is real idealistic

#s191
she might
