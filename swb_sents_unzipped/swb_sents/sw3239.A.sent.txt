#s1
Well do you have any pets

#s5
Oh

#s7
Oh

#s8
I used to have box turtles um well years ago when I was growing up

#s10
I I really like them

#s14
Oh

#s18
Yes

#s19
um we have one dog a Bichon Frise

#s20
Um our friends in Houston bred the dogs

#s21
I had never heard of them

#s24
they 're um they 're all white

#s25
and they 're small and um and fluffy

#s26
they do n't shed

#s27
I guess they 're distantly related to a poodle

#s28
but they 're not very well known in this country

#s29
and they 're not um high strung or over bred um

#s32
Ours is uh on the small end

#s33
and she 's about ten pounds

#s34
and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds

#s36
and they love people um and kids

#s37
and that was something we were looking for um

#s38
our our love is Golden Retrievers

#s39
and that 's what we had intended to get in Houston

#s40
but we had a small yard and a pool

#s41
and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate

#s46
so uh we ended up getting this

#s47
and uh my son would rather have a Golden Retriever though I think

#s49
now he wants a a good size dog

#s54
Oh

#s55
Yeah

#s57
Well they really are um they 're really sweet dogs

#s58
We 've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um the family that had them and and bred them

#s59
They had five litters of puppies

#s60
and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood

#s63
because um

#s65
It 's B I C H O N F R I S E

#s68
Bichon Frise

#s71
Yeah

#s72
They 're uh

#s73
and they do n't shed

#s74
so they 're they 're good dogs for people with with allergies

#s76
and they love people

#s77
and they 're

#s79
Um no

#s80
not really

#s81
Ours um ours barks more than um than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends ' house

#s82
We used to swap back and forth dogs

#s83
MUMBLEx they have three dogs

#s84
They had a Cockapoo and and two Bichons um

#s86
and she did n't bark at all until she spent time there

#s88
and uh now it 's funny

#s89
She 's she 's a good watch dog

#s91
and if there 's she 'll bark that way

#s92
but she also talks a lot

#s93
she um has a definite personality

#s95
and so if we 're leaving her she barks at us because she does n't want to be left

#s96
Um

#s99
No

#s100
no

#s101
and they 're um they 're very smart dogs

#s102
The circuses in Europe used to use them um for the acts

#s104
They uh oh they 'll dance on their hind legs each

#s107
um but they 're very easy to train

#s109
and

#s111
Well they range

#s112
I 'd noticed up here they 're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper

#s113
They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars I think which I thought was a lot

#s115
Well she 's no longer breeding them

#s117
but um because her dogs um the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem

#s119
and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know

#s120
they were n't were n't show quality

#s125
Ri-

#s128
Oh but yeah takes a lot of time

#s131
Yeah

#s132
um but she might have some contacts here

#s133
I know origina- I know that the dog 's grandmother um was from Plano

#s135
Oh that 's where I live too
