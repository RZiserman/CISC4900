#s2
Yeah

#s5
Well uh it 's funny

#s6
when I tried to make the call the other days

#s7
I thought

#s8
I had n't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES

#s9
but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY

#s11
It was really good

#s12
We

#s14
uh Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital

#s16
and uh Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood

#s17
and uh we all liked it

#s18
We had both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old

#s19
and everyone enjoyed it

#s21
And uh

#s26
Yeah

#s28
Well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another A lot of the ones I had wanted to see

#s30
and so since he had this friend up from Houston uh and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well I want to see this one too

#s31
So we uh I

#s33
finally it 's my first summer movie

#s45
Yeah

#s49
Oh was that good

#s50
Cause

#s55
Yeah

#s56
Well I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both

#s57
I love comedies

#s59
But that 's what I was

#s61
Oh was it

#s63
Oh

#s68
Oh well good

#s69
I 'm I 'm glad to hear that because they

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Well I do n't I do n't know if you got to see WEEKEND um AT BERNIE 'S that was out a couple of years ago

#s78
They had a free showing at the Berkeley um United Artist

#s80
And I do n't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend

#s81
and we did n't think we 'd have much chance of getting in

#s82
but we thought we 'd try it you know

#s83
free movie

#s86
It was so funny

#s87
and it sounds like uh what you were just describing SOAPDISH too

#s88
I mean we just we hurt by the time we came out

#s90
And the whole theater was hysterical

#s91
and it 's just it 's just goofy

#s92
I mean it 's uh

#s93
if you have a chance to rent it at least

#s94
or it should be out on T V I would think

#s98
Um cause it 's it 's just a fun summer light comedy

#s99
make your cheeks hurt laughing

#s100
Especially in the theater it was contagious you know

#s102
I I imagine the way SOAPDISH was but with everyone laughing

#s107
Well I 'm glad you did that before your surgery

#s109
Yeah

#s112
Yeah

#s114
Oh gosh

#s118
Oh

#s121
Yeah

#s135
Yeah

#s145
Yeah

#s146
Yeah

#s148
Yeah

#s152
No

#s153
that was one uh Jay got to see with a friend

#s154
and so I

#s156
and to try and uh try and find time it 's hard uh with Jim 's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go

#s158
And uh I 'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it 's just perfect for our age group

#s160
and because I think he he needs a comedy too

#s161
Uh and that 's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY too

#s162
but knew that uh

#s163
we 've we 've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful

#s164
We 're really enjoying it

#s165
but some of the different things we 're doing uh there 's just not a time enough time to do it all

#s167
and he said well realistically You know he knew he could n't get them all in

#s169
But uh Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD

#s170
Um when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was uh

#s171
it was funny cause he sounded like the critics

#s172
He said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know are n't real big

#s173
but the the fire scenes and the dra- you know that action part is fantastic

#s175
But he thought ROBIN HOOD was great

#s176
It was real different then you 'd expect

#s177
but h- but he enjoyed it

#s179
and so

#s182
Yeah

#s183
me too

#s184
And yeah

#s186
I really uh like him a lot Which is why DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen for several months

#s188
but

#s190
It was

#s191
I uh

#s192
in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March

#s193
and we wanted we did n't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it

#s194
We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it too

#s196
Uh I just thought that was terrific

#s197
And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see

#s200
And he 's very good in REGARDING HENRY

#s201
That 's not an easy part to play I I do n't think

#s205
Yeah

#s206
That 's at that one wo n't your sides

#s208
Um it

#s209
was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS

#s210
Or

#s213
Uh-huh
