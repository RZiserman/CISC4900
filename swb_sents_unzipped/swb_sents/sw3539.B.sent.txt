Okay

#s3
There is

#s4
well I am a school teacher

#s6
And us

#s7
there is uh uh girl that went through our school district I teach in Highland Park who uh does aerobics at the Y C A and I say Y the Y W C A

#s10
turn that off please

#s11
I am recording

#s12
My husband just turned on something noisy

#s14
Any way uh she comes to the school

#s15
and there are a group of teachers

#s16
and we exercise regularly and uh for an hour

#s18
and we do it twice a week

#s20
And uh we do uh aerobics for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes

#s21
and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes

#s24
So it is an hour

#s25
And then my husband and I take uh ten mile walks uh as often as possible

#s27
And uh not on the nights that I do aerobics but if if he wants to he jogs

#s28
but I uh I we take the fast walks

#s29
and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house

#s31
And so we we take it seriously

#s32
We enjoy doing it

#s34
I enjoy my group at school

#s35
It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself

#s40
Oh oh

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
Oh I understand that

#s47
I have never been able to do it before

#s50
Well I and too

#s51
I just make myself

#s53
I get up at five thirty

#s54
and I am at school at seven thirty

#s56
School is not over until uh four

#s58
and our class

#s59
but it is in the building

#s61
that is the big difference

#s62
because there are other people around that uh

#s63
you had better hurry

#s64
Go get dressed

#s65
You know there is motivation around there

#s66
and then uh we we can change right there in the building

#s67
I do n't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere

#s69
And I just go

#s70
and we uh exercise

#s71
And until then you know I have belonged to exercise clubs

#s72
and oh I have gone to uh oh like uh oh these gyms you know that the like in Plano and Richardson and uh where they offer the uh rec centers really where they offer aerobics

#s74
and I have done that before

#s75
but it has always had to be late at night after I have got home and after dinner

#s77
and you are just kind of going Ugh

#s78
And I have tried it immediately after school

#s79
like try to get some place and exercise from five to six

#s80
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late

#s84
It is

#s85
It is really hard with our life style when you work to

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
I have twenty-five minutes for lunch

#s93
That is out for me

#s95
No

#s96
I do n't think so

#s98
But uh and they are nice because if we are running late it usually uh

#s99
if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us

#s100
You know cause they know we are in the building and coming Where as at uh another place you are paying a lot more money

#s102
and uh it does going to start whether you are there or not

#s105
So this has worked out real nicely

#s106
In fact she charges us two dollars a session

#s108
Huh-uh

#s109
So it 's it 's

#s110
we like pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is like a unit in uh uh school uh report card period

#s113
and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks

#s116
Huh-uh

#s119
You are not kidding

#s121
I know

#s122
We belonged uh for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year

#s124
I mean we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership

#s126
and at first we used it

#s127
and then it got where we were n't beginning to get out money 's worth

#s129
And they offered lots of things

#s130
but we were n't taking advantage of them because we did n't have the time to

#s132
So we decided to forget that

#s134
That was just a waste of our our money

#s139
Oh no

#s143
Uh-huh

#s145
It does make you feel better

#s146
The hard thing is getting going

#s148
And if you have somebody who will do it with you

#s149
like for a long time my husband did n't want to walk cause he wants to uh jog

#s151
but he decided that uh maybe uh you know
