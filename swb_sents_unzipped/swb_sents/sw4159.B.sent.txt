Well I work for an insurance company

#s4
so I see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided Um by juries particularly

#s5
and I know in England the judges set all of the awards

#s6
You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence

#s7
but then they leave the awards up to more learned people

#s8
And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars

#s13
Oh exactly

#s14
Each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what um the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range

#s16
When you get one way out like that

#s17
but then really does n't pen- wind up penalizing the person that they went after

#s18
Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us If they get some of those mega awards against them

#s20
You know they 're not going to sit there and lose money

#s21
If they are losing money then they 're going to raise rates

#s24
So it all comes filtering down to us all in- individually

#s26
And uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged you know

#s29
I do n't know

#s30
You know some of the health insurance is written that way You know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s- pre specified in the policy so much

#s31
but I do n't know that you can necessarily put a a value on somebody 's limb uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases

#s33
I think maybe you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with with that

#s34
I mean maybe you do n't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old

#s36
I I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there

#s37
And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing

#s39
and that can be part of continuing education maybe for judges

#s41
I do n't know

#s43
You know to get into the economics of things uh

#s44
because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury 's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they 're trying for get away

#s47
If it 's a company you know that they 're insured

#s48
Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages

#s50
I think those should be uninsurable

#s51
I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage

#s54
Yeah

#s56
Yeah

#s59
For for honest mistakes where they 've done something and and something happens

#s60
One of their employees causes damage or something

#s62
Sure

#s63
That 's what they buy insurance for

#s66
Well I was just talking about any company

#s67
Uh let 's just say a lumber manufacturing company

#s70
and uh somebody is on the premises

#s72
and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift

#s73
and he pushes the wrong button

#s74
and he drops a load of lumber on somebody

#s75
and it injures them

#s78
Sure

#s79
Insurance should pay for that

#s81
Well I 'm not talking about any loss

#s82
I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of

#s83
the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person 's actual injuries and what they are due

#s84
And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a l- usually a lot less

#s85
But it 's an an amount they 're designed to sting them a little for their negligence For gross wanton negligence in a claim

#s89
And unfortunately the ch- the

#s90
lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too

#s92
So again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong

#s95
They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to

#s97
And if if they know some practice is wrong you know

#s98
I 'm not talking about your isolated occurrences

#s99
I 'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know

#s100
maybe they 're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there

#s101
and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that

#s104
Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
