#s11
I do n't know

#s12
Uh I have n't

#s13
it 's been uh well seventy-nine since I was at school At high school

#s15
And uh I 've seen things change

#s16
I do n't know if I 've seen things change enough that I can actually

#s17
because I was n't really like listening to the world go by back then

#s18
so it 's hard to compare

#s19
You know what I mean

#s21
But uh it seems like when I li- I lived in Chicago

#s22
I I 've lived down here

#s23
I hear the dropout rates from the schools

#s24
and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year

#s26
And I begin to wonder if I 'm really getting my money 's worth

#s28
I mean I I 've seen so many different things So so many different bad reports coming out of the school system

#s29
and I recognize that there are good schools out there

#s30
I mean somebody 's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people

#s32
But uh I do n't I do n't understand the uh I do n't understand I guess why the schools don- seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities

#s44
I do n't know if I blame it on the school

#s45
I think I think I blame it I think I blame it on a couple of different things

#s46
I think I blame it on the school system Uh

#s48
Yeah

#s49
I do n't blame it on the teachers in the school I although I think that

#s50
I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than

#s51
well they do quite well for themselves

#s54
No

#s55
Not all school districts are well paid

#s56
But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid

#s57
I mean I know one family that 's got

#s58
they 're both teachers

#s59
and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons

#s61
They both work all summer full-time

#s62
And from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each

#s65
I mean that family is making over a hundred grand

#s66
And I 'm

#s67
I mean okay

#s68
okay

#s69
Yes

#s70
I agree that teaching our kids is important

#s72
However these people who only work eight hours day at it from seven to three

#s73
and they only work nine months a year

#s74
and they get an awful lot of breaks in between

#s75
and that 's my tax dollars that I 'm spending on that

#s76
And I do n't even have kids
