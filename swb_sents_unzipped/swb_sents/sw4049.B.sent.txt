Well uh I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing

#s3
Um I do n't really think that it 's uh too many

#s4
I think it 's a severe invasion of somebody 's privacy to say well we 're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you 're uh you know worthy of working for us

#s5
I really do n't see that that 's a very very valid uh thing for a company to say

#s6
and I personally I do n't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what 's inside my body

#s11
Well I think I think we I think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs

#s13
There 's too many cases where it can you know

#s14
there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing

#s15
I do n't think there 's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs

#s16
so we do n't want him here

#s18
Uh like I said some industries though I think it 'd be very necessary

#s19
I would n't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I 'm flying in an airplane

#s21
But uh I I just I find it to be pretty offensive that that it 's such a a big deal

#s22
I mean if your employer 's not going to trust you

#s23
or you know it

#s24
I just I think it 's a whole trust issue

#s25
I just ca n't see it

#s28
Uh yeah

#s29
I have been

#s31
I I mean I was very offended by by the whole process

#s35
I mean it 's very humiliating

#s36
and I mean I 'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs

#s37
but I uh I am totally against that sort of a uh

#s38
I mean it 's it 's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I 'm going to talk to you

#s42
Right

#s44
Yeah

#s45
Right

#s46
Right

#s47
That 's that 's basically my opinion on it right there is that it 's just you know

#s48
I did I I was in the same sort of situation as

#s49
it was a job interview

#s50
and then you had a physical where you were drug tested

#s51
and it 's

#s52
I just

#s53
and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know

#s54
I really

#s55
The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy as in my it 's my bodily fluid

#s56
and I do n't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that

#s58
just to the fact that I do n't know that it is a company 's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they 're not at work

#s59
I mean during the eight hours during the day when they 're supposed to be there I think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable

#s60
and these are not

#s61
but when it enters into what they 're doing when they 're not at work I find that to be fairly offensive also

#s64
Right

#s65
Right

#s67
That 's exactly right

#s69
And also I just think it it gets a lot

#s70
I 'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies

#s71
and I think that it just moves down along a line that that I really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees ' lives outside of work you know

#s72
there 's already talk of people

#s73
well we 're not going to hire you if you smoke

#s75
Well you know I I can see how they can say in the work place we you do n't want them to smoke

#s76
but when somebody leaves work I do n't think that it 's the employer 's right to regulate their life style at all

#s79
Uh I really think it should be except as I 've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it 's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times

#s81
And other than that I think I do not think it should be allowable

#s82
I think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that

#s83
It should it 's kind of the big brother syndrome

#s84
I mean I just

#s85
anything like that just kind of scares me

#s89
Right

#s91
Right
