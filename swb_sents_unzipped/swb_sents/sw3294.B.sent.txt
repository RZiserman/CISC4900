#s1
Well let 's see

#s3
As far as I 'm

#s4
Well the thing I think that annoys me the most is I have I have young children a baby in the house

#s5
and and inevitably as soon as they 're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something

#s7
And I think that that is probably the most aggravating

#s9
Uh you know it invades my time

#s10
I 'm the one that pays for the phone

#s11
Uh if I want to buy something I 'll take the initiative and and go find it you know

#s12
And that just really does aggravate me

#s13
Uh what do you think

#s21
Your time is is valuable

#s24
and

#s26
Oh I

#s27
that 's that 's interesting

#s28
I

#s29
the the market seems to just be growing too

#s30
I I guess enough people are not speaking out

#s31
I 'm not speaking out

#s32
that 's for sure

#s33
I just get aggravated about it

#s34
And

#s37
I really do n't know

#s38
I 'm I 'm not into uh heavy government legislate- legislating of a lot of different areas

#s39
but I I do n't know

#s40
I just I do particularly find it annoying

#s41
Uh I 'm really not sure

#s42
I have n't given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know to be

#s45
Well that yeah that might

#s47
Identify themselves

#s48
yeah

#s49
Right

#s50
Well that would be a good an interesting way

#s52
yeah

#s55
Right

#s57
Right

#s58
you 're

#s60
Oh is that right

#s61
Oh that 's interesting

#s63
And they just get everybody

#s65
Oh boy

#s66
Well I I do wish that it would stop on my end because it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments

#s68
And I I guess the next one is is door-to-door solicitors

#s70
I do n't mind the children when they 're selling things for school

#s71
I have kids

#s72
and you know that 's just kind of part of it

#s74
but when it 's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning uh that really it makes you not feel particularly safe

#s77
and it 's annoying as well

#s79
Right

#s80
you just you really do n't know

#s81
so I I find myself being a l- a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than I might normally be

#s83
but I do feel like it 's a an invasion of my space

#s85
And uh

#s87
I 've never quite understood the purpose of that

#s88
Yeah

#s89
I uh

#s91
Just be-

#s96
Just a survey

#s98
Yeah

#s99
There have been a couple of times when the the uh whatever the subject was I guess caught my interest and I went along with it

#s100
and then there have been several times when I just said well I just really do n't have the time you know to deal with it at that moment

#s103
But uh I do n't get too many of those

#s105
I 've had just a few

#s107
Uh generally someone 's trying to sell me something

#s108
or

#s111
Right

#s112
right

#s114
Right

#s116
Yeah

#s117
That 's right

#s120
Oh

#s126
Right

#s128
Yeah

#s130
Well we

#s132
That 's true

#s135
Yeah

#s136
you just never know I guess

#s137
That

#s138
yeah

#s139
I I

#s141
Asking for information is is

#s142
I ca n't really see that

#s143
I think they ought to if if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp

#s144
and you know when it arrives at your house oh I
