There we are

#s6
Well I have a Honda um hatchback nineteen eighty-four

#s8
And I had a hatchback a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one

#s10
And uh I 'll be honest with you

#s11
I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and and uh put together

#s12
and it it does its job

#s13
All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles

#s14
and I I did have to put two two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles

#s15
but that car just purrs like the day it was built

#s16
I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh twen- twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town

#s17
It 's a five speed straight stick machine

#s19
And I can carry more in that uh that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars

#s20
and I have a large um Pontiac

#s21
and I have a sixty-nine Cougar which really is I 'm saving because it 's it 's old

#s22
but it 's in beautiful shape

#s24
But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in in those other bigger cars

#s28
Oh oh

#s30
L X

#s35
It was an L X

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
yours is a four door

#s44
Uh-huh

#s47
Yeah

#s52
Yes

#s53
they are

#s57
Um uh-huh

#s60
Ninety-five is wild in any car

#s61
There 's no doubt about that

#s64
because I I I run over to Crystal City or used to

#s65
I 'm retiring the end of this month

#s67
but I 'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
uh-huh

#s74
Uh-huh

#s81
Yes

#s82
it just just sits there and purrs

#s83
and you all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter

#s84
I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas

#s87
Yeah

#s89
Beautiful beautiful machine

#s95
Is that right

#s96
uh-huh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s99
Well a brand new Volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars

#s102
Uh-huh

#s105
Um uh-huh

#s109
Yeah

#s117
Well my my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it

#s119
and I 've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach Virginia where my mother lives and things like that

#s120
and I drive it
