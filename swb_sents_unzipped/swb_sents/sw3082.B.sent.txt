#s2
Yes

#s4
Oh are you really

#s6
Where is it going to be

#s8
Oh

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Oh that 's marvelous

#s15
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s24
I 'm sure location 's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be

#s26
Uh-huh

#s27
We have factions when it 's one part

#s28
we I have one reunion on my mother 's side

#s29
and we found that if it 's in a certain part of Texas some people come

#s30
and if it 's elsewhere other people come

#s32
we never get them at both of them

#s34
it seems like

#s35
so I think we need to find a new place

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
Um

#s45
Oh that 's a neat idea

#s49
Uh-huh

#s52
Uh-huh

#s53
How many people Jim are involved

#s55
Wow

#s57
Yeah

#s58
well I guess um ours probably is n't that big

#s59
Our family is dwindling for one thing

#s61
And I often feel funny because I 'm in a branch that 's all but died

#s63
I just have one aunt and my family

#s64
So sometimes when these other families get together they 're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids

#s66
and we 're kind of off on the sidelines

#s67
But it does remind us that we have family and roots

#s69
So we keep going even though we 're not a real big part of it

#s72
Uh-huh

#s76
Oh that 's great

#s78
Uh-huh

#s79
uh-huh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s87
So there 's lots to do

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
that 's true

#s96
Well that 's neat

#s97
I think think they 're really fun

#s98
We go to mine regularly

#s99
and then we go to my husband 's occasionally down in Temple

#s100
and he has a large family

#s101
so it 's it 's fun when we go to that one

#s106
Oh

#s107
Yeah

#s108
yeah

#s109
that that is a problem with the distance

#s110
The people that we have that do n't come are out El Paso way

#s112
and it 's just too much for all of them all of that group to travel

#s114
Right

#s115
But then we have the same attitude when it 's out there although this year we 're going out

#s116
They 're going to have it at Fort Davis

#s118
and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion

#s123
Uh-huh

#s127
Uh-huh

#s128
And choose some place that everybody 's going to like as far as food and all that

#s131
That 's a heavy burden

#s136
No

#s139
Uh-huh

#s142
Well I think

#s143
Yeah

#s144
and it 's it 's good for kids to know that they have other family

#s149
Oh boy

#s151
Oh what fun

#s152
Uh-huh

#s154
Uh-huh

#s155
Probably lots of laughs

#s159
Uh-huh

#s160
Well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along

#s161
Ours ours is still kind of loosely organized

#s162
and the same people usually get stuck with doing it

#s165
And they do it as a labor of love

#s167
So the officer idea is a good idea

#s170
Uh-huh

#s172
Yeah

#s174
Uh-huh

#s178
Uh-huh

#s180
Yeah

#s181
and it 's not fair that everybody not contribute

#s184
Uh-huh

#s186
Well thanks a lot

#s187
I enjoyed talking to you

#s188
Bye
