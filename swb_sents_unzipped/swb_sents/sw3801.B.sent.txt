#s3
No

#s4
I do n't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer

#s6
Uh one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something 's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams

#s7
and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house

#s9
And they had stopped a uh b- a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge

#s10
Oh boy

#s11
and then the other one was on the roof in the back

#s13
B- on my house

#s16
So I 'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it

#s18
It was

#s19
I uh I kept hearing noises

#s20
and so I I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage

#s21
so I got a g- my gun and walked to the you know through the house into the garage

#s22
There was no one there

#s23
but I wanted to be sure

#s25
Is Plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area

#s27
That 's too bad

#s30
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s37
Well I was thinking if you 've been there that long you 've seen Plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city

#s40
Uh-huh

#s44
Well I was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway

#s46
Uh well it 's farther west of me

#s47
Okay

#s48
I live over near White Rock Lake

#s50
okay

#s51
But uh

#s52
uh it was really frightening to think that uh it 's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth

#s53
Uh I never thought about someone robbing those

#s54
but apparently they do

#s56
but

#s57
Yeah

#s58
it just does n't seem possible does it

#s63
No

#s65
Yeah

#s66
and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in uh the theft and the the violence that we see

#s68
It it is convenient is n't it

#s70
I did n't know what I was doing

#s72
That kind

#s76
Uh-huh

#s77
Uh-huh

#s78
Well yes

#s79
and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System

#s81
And uh uh

#s83
Uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are

#s87
Uh no

#s88
this is over near Lincoln High School Uh just not far off South Central Expressway

#s89
Okay

#s90
That 's a pretty rough area there is n't it

#s91
It is a pretty rough area

#s92
We 're over by Fair Park

#s94
And uh you know you watch the people

#s95
There are marvelous B M W -s and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns

#s97
And the kids see that

#s98
and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if

#s103
It surely is

#s105
Well I 'm careful

#s106
Gee-

#s108
Yeah

#s109
it 's uh a little scary sometimes

#s110
and uh I manage the
