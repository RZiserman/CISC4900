#s1
And you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue

#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s17
Yeah

#s19
Uh-huh

#s21
Right

#s23
Well I 'm a little bit ambivalent

#s24
The problem with uh and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in in terms of what uh really is driving it

#s25
They 're not willing to tell the truth The same way with uh issues of uh race and things like that

#s26
I mean right now uh I believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration

#s27
Three actually

#s28
One is at the high end uh

#s29
they always want to be able to uh do some brain draining

#s30
They always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou

#s31
or you know

#s33
They 'd like to be able to get the top people in any field

#s34
and so they can almost always find room for someone like that

#s35
At the bottom end they uh are always willing to uh let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area

#s36
Those are two things that I think are going on Although they I I do n't think the politicians would tell you that

#s39
And then the third thing is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico

#s40
They can not close off the Mexican border Not because it 's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country

#s41
so they keep allowing uh the pressure cooker to let off steam

#s44
Uh that 's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan

#s45
I think they 're a very difficult group to integrate into uh society

#s46
They 're very difficult uh group to find jobs and uh and uh places for

#s47
And so uh uh I do n't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they 're pretty miserable where they are

#s48
But I 'm not to sympathetic about uh letting large numbers of Haitians in

#s50
Yeah

#s53
Right

#s54
But if you let them yeah If you let them in a million at a time it would n't make that you know it would n't make that big a bulge in the population

#s55
But po- politically and economically

#s58
Yeah

#s59
well I know about it

#s60
Uh I mean it 's it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago

#s65
On the other hand you know the ironic thing about this is that there 's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant

#s66
So there 's uh there 's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in

#s69
Right

#s70
Sure

#s72
Right

#s77
Uh-huh

#s79
Uh-huh
