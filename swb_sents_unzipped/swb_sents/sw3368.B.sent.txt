#s3
Um huh Well I do n't like it when uh people listen to my phone conversations like if they 're outside my door while I 'm talking in my room or when people like look through my things in my bedroom

#s7
Yeah

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Yes

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Definitely

#s18
Right

#s22
Right

#s23
Even uh we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting

#s24
and they would still come to our door and knock and

#s27
I guess not

#s28
no

#s30
Yeah

#s33
Yes

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Yeah

#s38
Yeah

#s39
mostly

#s40
Yeah

#s42
Oh I do n't know

#s43
Well I am used to it now

#s44
but sometimes it sort of gets gets to me

#s45
but there is not much I can really do

#s47
No

#s49
Yeah

#s52
Well I do n't know

#s53
I always

#s55
Uh no

#s56
yes

#s57
I do

#s58
but they do n't live at home

#s64
Oh I used to do that though because I was the youngest

#s65
I would pick up the phone and listen to theirs

#s66
But I

#s69
Oh

#s72
Yeah

#s73
But I stopped doing that a long time ago

#s74
and they still do it to me

#s77
Oh like s-

#s78
yeah

#s79
this lady does that to me at work when I 'm taking an order or something

#s81
and she 'll just sit there and listen like I 'm doing something wrong

#s82
and she just started

#s83
and she is nice

#s84
but

#s85
Okay

#s86
But you know it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do

#s88
But I-

#s91
No

#s94
Right

#s95
Well occasionally we 'll have a person here or there but not not as many as the phone calls you know

#s97
so But

#s102
Uh

#s104
Oh

#s107
Oh yeah

#s108
Especially when you 're in a hurry

#s110
Um it can get busy

#s111
yeah

#s112
Usually in the week I 'm MUMBLEx

#s116
Yeah

#s117
uh-huh

#s119
Yeah

#s120
I 've traveled quiet a bit

#s121
and I 've been through Dallas Texas

#s122
It 's pretty busy

#s125
Yeah

#s127
Yeah

#s131
Uh-huh

#s132
Oh yeah

#s135
Oh yeah

#s136
I suppose you do

#s139
Uh-huh

#s140
Yeah

#s142
Yeah

#s143
I am a real solid sleeper though

#s144
so that probably would n't bother me

#s145
I 'd sleep right through it

#s147
Yeah

#s148
It takes a lot

#s151
I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time

#s153
I was mad because those were mine MUMBLEx

#s155
No

#s156
It was a a letter from a girlfriend of mine

#s157
I I just I was upset because those were mine

#s158
and you know I thought he

#s161
Right

#s162
I thought he would respect me more than that to look through my things and not trust me

#s164
so that was upsetting

#s165
I was mad about that and my privacy there
