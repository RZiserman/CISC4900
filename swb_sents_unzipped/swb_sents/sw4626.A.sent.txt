#s1
Okay

#s4
Yes

#s5
Yeah

#s6
Well i- I I I feel like uh I am from Mars

#s7
I mean I 'm fifty years old

#s8
and uh I 've been divorced for um eighteen years

#s9
But I 've two kids and all

#s10
But I uh I I 've never had a budget

#s11
and I do n't uh do any planning

#s12
and I do n't know

#s13
I do n't uh uh I do n't have a long-term financial plan

#s14
I do n't try to control my expenses

#s15
But I 'm I 'm glad you 're a stranger

#s17
But really I 'm I happy I I well I 'm curious how other people live

#s18
Uh so maybe we should start with you

#s19
What do you do

#s21
Really

#s23
Oh

#s24
Maybe they 're going to arrest us both

#s29
Wow

#s33
Uh-huh

#s35
Yeah

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s44
Huh The uh

#s45
I had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy-six

#s46
and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time

#s47
and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that

#s48
And I actually did

#s49
my bank account would uh

#s50
I 'd I I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month

#s51
but I I had miscalculated

#s52
I well I did n't keep a balance

#s53
It 's one of the problems

#s54
I never had to in the past

#s55
I always kept plenty of money in my checking account

#s56
but when you 're only earning half the salary Even though I was n't spending much money I sometimes I sometimes would just

#s57
things would get to tight

#s58
Uh and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet

#s59
and every time I uh I spent money I mean cash mostly I would uh write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning

#s62
But I would forget to write the things down

#s63
and it that I I do n't know if I ever went as far as three months or not i- i- in keeping that kind of data

#s64
I certainly have n't done that in sixteen years or whatever

#s66
Yeah

#s68
Uh-huh

#s70
Yeah

#s73
Uh-huh

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
The uh

#s77
I i- I have to say that

#s78
let 's see

#s79
at this point on I do n't run out of money

#s80
Uh and it uh

#s81
a- and I do n't I mean

#s82
someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I do n't have

#s83
and I I I think my strategy if if I may i- i- is to is to not spend money

#s84
I mean I do n't have expensive tastes

#s85
I do n't go out

#s86
I mean I buy a car

#s87
well the last car I got rid of I 'd had

#s88
it was nineteen years old

#s90
Pe- people were embarrassed for me

#s91
I mean it was it was a good car

#s92
and

#s94
Oh it was great

#s95
My my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty-five Buick

#s96
and it just would n't stop

#s97
Uh and it

#s98
I I just did n't feel the need for a new car

#s99
It is n't like I could n't afford one

#s101
Uh and now I mean I I do n't uh

#s102
I tend to eat expensive food

#s103
I mean I do n't mind buying a good steak

#s104
but for me I only do that every week or without even I mean maybe once a month

#s106
I mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound

#s107
You buy a a less than half a pound

#s108
so it 's six or seven dollars

#s109
To me I realize if you have eight kids you 're not going to run out and do that

#s111
But but I 'm just I 'm just saying as a single person that 's that 's a drop in the bucket

#s112
And so if you 're extravagant on how you buy food it does n't add up If you 're buying I mean if you 're not going to super expensive restaurants which I do n't care to go to

#s114
So so that 's I think one of the reasons I do n't need to budget is that I do n't have I do n't I do n't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I ca n't afford it because I 'm not interested in that expensive thing
