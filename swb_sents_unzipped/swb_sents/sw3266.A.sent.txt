Very good

#s2
Uh discussion or on child care

#s4
Uh they 're all grown up

#s8
Oh well you know all about it then

#s11
It 's been quite a few years

#s12
I have grandchildren but uh have n't really been into selecting child care for them

#s13
so

#s15
And it 's been quite a few years since I 've had to think about that

#s18
No

#s19
Uh m- my daughter that has three stays home with her children

#s21
and one of my daughters has one

#s22
but an aunt keeps the baby

#s24
But I would I would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays

#s25
but I would imagine it 's very hard

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Oh well that 's good

#s40
I 've always thought you know it would be really tough

#s41
What if you had a fire or something with babies

#s44
You would have to be able to have enough

#s45
you know you 'd have to be able to get them all out

#s47
Uh-huh

#s52
Oh well that 's that 's a

#s54
I had n't thought about that

#s55
But I was thinking oh my gosh if they had very many babies they could n't possibly get them all out

#s57
But you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out I guess

#s59
Oh

#s61
well that 's neat

#s64
Well do most of your day-care workers really care about the children

#s65
or is it just a job for them

#s68
Uh-huh

#s71
Uh-huh

#s75
Uh-huh

#s77
Yeah

#s78
How old a group how old are the children go with this center where you work

#s80
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s84
You 've got the little bitty ones

#s86
Those are the probably the bestes- the best group to have

#s89
And they 're fun

#s92
Babies are fun

#s93
and they 're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet

#s94
so

#s99
Uh-huh

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
Do you think there 's very many really good day-care centers around your area

#s108
Uh-huh

#s111
Uh-huh

#s113
Uh-huh

#s116
Sometimes it 's a have to

#s118
I hear a lot of the girls I work with uh constantly oh

#s119
I wish I could find someplace I really felt good about

#s120
You know

#s122
Most of them do n't really feel that it 's a great place to leave their kids

#s124
And it 's really bad you know

#s125
One of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place

#s126
and then they called her one afternoon and said well we thought we 'd better call and tell you before you got over here

#s127
Lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today

#s128
and we just now found her

#s130
They had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon

#s132
And so immediately she says well I ca n't have any confidence in them anymore

#s133
if they 'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they 're one short

#s135
But one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus

#s137
And this was four hours later you know

#s139
And uh so you know

#s140
what do you do

#s142
So she has switched to a different center now

#s143
and uh
