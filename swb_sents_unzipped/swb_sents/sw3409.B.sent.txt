#s1
So how many um credit cards do you have

#s3
Oh my gosh

#s4
I wish I was that way

#s5
Is that why you said I had more experience than you

#s8
Oh

#s9
Well how how do you use your credit card

#s10
I mean do you just keep it in reserve

#s11
or

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s20
How how do you use it

#s23
Yeah

#s24
that 's understandable

#s25
exactly

#s29
Uh-huh

#s31
Right

#s32
right

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
uh-huh

#s36
Well actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have

#s37
Um and I use them you know

#s38
like my American Express I use for you know gas things like that

#s39
and I pay that off monthly

#s40
and then um some other credit cards like store credit cards you know I do have them up there a little bit

#s41
but uh

#s43
I try not to use them too often

#s44
But living in this area uh

#s45
like I live fifteen miles west of Washington D C

#s47
it 's a very expensive area

#s49
So sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something

#s53
Right

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that

#s60
Uh-huh

#s62
Now are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card

#s63
or

#s66
Uh-huh

#s68
Uh-huh

#s69
Um

#s70
Uh-huh

#s73
Uh-huh

#s74
um

#s75
Right

#s76
right

#s77
Well well that 's great

#s78
Um everyone I know here uses um credit cards like they 're going out of business to be honest with you

#s82
Yeah

#s83
yeah

#s84
Yeah

#s85
the only other one I have

#s86
I have like a Diner 's Club through my um where I work

#s88
so that I use because I travel some

#s89
So I use that

#s90
and I do n't really have to worry about that because I only use it for business

#s91
so I automatically have the money to pay it off

#s93
But Um

#s97
Uh-huh

#s99
Uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s102
Uh-huh

#s103
Yeah

#s106
Um the temptation 's too great

#s108
Um

#s111
Yeah

#s112
that 's true

#s113
that 's true

#s114
but So I guess uh we 've kind of exhausted this uh topic

#s118
Yeah

#s119
you ca n't say too much about it really

#s122
Uh-huh

#s127
Okay

#s128
you too

#s129
Yeah

#s130
may be you 're the furthest person actually that I 've talked

#s131
I 've talked to a lot of people in Texas

#s133
Yeah

#s135
Yeah

#s136
so

#s139
O- okay

#s140
bye-bye
