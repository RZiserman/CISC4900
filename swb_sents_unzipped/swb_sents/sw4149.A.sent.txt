Wendy I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh

#s3
let me ask you the question

#s4
do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s15
I see

#s16
I see

#s17
Well good

#s18
I 'm kind of in a different situation

#s19
but I I I went through that too when I was in school

#s20
but uh I was I was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that

#s21
but uh I 'm married and have uh a a couple of children

#s22
and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget

#s24
I 'm on a salary

#s25
so I do n't get any overtime or anything like that

#s26
but We have a fixed income

#s28
and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have will is spent accordingly

#s29
and uh what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment

#s31
we have the insurance premiums uh utilities and so forth

#s32
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we 're going to spend and set that money aside

#s33
and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll- the kids ' education college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds

#s35
and and we also set aside an emergency fund

#s36
because we 've uh we 've been married for about ten years

#s38
and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there 's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh not enough to go and to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for

#s41
And uh then we have you know

#s42
whatever 's left over is disposable in- disposable dis- yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month

#s43
so and it 's worked out very well

#s44
It 's uh it 's helped us so that we have n't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money

#s45
and uh try and stick with that

#s47
and nice thing about it I my wife is is excellent in that

#s48
we both work together

#s49
we both have a budget

#s50
and we stick to it

#s52
and there 's no surprises in that

#s54
Well actually I have four kids

#s56
So

#s57
yeah

#s58
I said a couple of kids

#s59

#s60

#s62

#s64

#s101
Yes

#s103
