The question was on lawn and garden work

#s2
Um how do you like it

#s9
Oh what kind do you have

#s11
Do they really

#s14
Oh

#s17
Oh and I know somebody that lives there

#s18
and they never mentioned that problem

#s25
Oh my

#s26
They probably just take it for granted then

#s31
Oh yuck

#s33
MUMBLEx I do n't have that problem

#s34
uh it 's

#s35
mine is mainly

#s36
we kind of have an understanding that uh

#s37
I I said I 'll do inside work

#s38
you do outside work

#s40
And so I get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that

#s42
But I do n't like I do n't like it dirty

#s45
No

#s46
I do n't know

#s47
We got the we got the question

#s48
and I thought oh this is going to be interesting

#s49
Two bits I 'll get a man to talk to me because they get stuck doing it all

#s50
But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work

#s51
And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home

#s52
so um we 've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall

#s54
Today we just had a lot of rain

#s56
Yeah

#s57
so it 's kind of nice

#s58
I do n't know how yours has been

#s63
Oh I see

#s65
Okay

#s66
Well we 're leaving tomorrow

#s67
and we 're going down to New Orleans

#s68
and from Ohio since we 're right near Lake Erie

#s69
this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there

#s71
and I think we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity

#s72
But um as far as the gardening and things like that goes I do n't know uh too much too much about uh how much I really r- do enjoy it myself

#s74
Do you like it at all

#s79
Well how about when you were in Colorado

#s83
Uh-huh

#s85
Well and then too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly My water bill was high

#s86
And uh if you have that on a regular basis in Texas I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off you know

#s88
But uh and with children um you probably do n't have time anyhow to to get into it

#s91
It 's so uh

#s92
okay very good

#s94
I guess we 've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we

#s100
Right

#s101
Okay

#s102
Right

#s105
Nice talking with you

#s108
Uh-huh

#s109
bye
