Well MUMBLEx see I 'm going to school right now

#s3
and uh while I 'm working I do n't get a I do n't get a chance to read the paper a lot

#s5
and I do n't watch T V as much really either because uh my free time is kind of

#s6
and I do like to do other stuff with it

#s8
While I 'm at work sometimes I on the computer network um I read the news sometimes

#s10
and that 's kind of helpful

#s13
That 's true

#s14
I mean my roommates and stuff you know people around me talk about it

#s16
And the people I work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff

#s17
so

#s22
Uh-huh

#s23
Yeah

#s24
Do you watch do you watch the network like major network news

#s25
or do you watch like the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR

#s28
Oh really

#s31
Uh-huh

#s33
Oh ch- see channel where I am channel eight 's um like public T V

#s34
so it 's kind of different

#s37
I think I think the uh I think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks

#s38
like right it 's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on

#s39
but um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news

#s43
Yeah

#s44
Yeah

#s45
exactly

#s48
Uh-huh

#s49
because they can they can only report on I mean

#s50
they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say

#s51
you you just ca n't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it

#s56
Yeah

#s58
Yeah

#s65
What kind of see

#s66
I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS

#s67
and that 's that 's real good because it gives like a brief summary of or like the updates like of what 's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that I would n't know about

#s69
but other than that I do n't really read

#s70
I do n't I do n't really subscribe to anything else

#s72
Uh-huh

#s76
Oh yeah

#s79
Yeah

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Well I remember back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on because that they were going constantly with that stuff

#s85
But uh

#s89
Yeah

#s91
If they reported every if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour

#s93
But uh

#s95
Oh yeah

#s96
that 's

#s97
they start already they 're having like um

#s98
in the newspaper they have a section I think every now and then on the Olympics you know

#s99
and they 've got like a countdown

#s100
it 's like sixteen hundred days or something

#s103
Oh really

#s105
That 's going to be crazy that time of year here

#s106
But uh

#s108
I ca n't believe I mean

#s109
they 're they 're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over

#s110
I guess people want to hear about it

#s111
Also big in the news right now is the Braves because they 're uh they 're in you know tr- spring training or whatever

#s114
and they did so well last year

#s119
Yeah

#s121
It seems like

#s122
I do n't know

#s123
they way they do the newscasts I wish they they kind of separated it you know

#s124
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it

#s125
but I do n't have cable
