MUMBLEx Capital punishment uh I guess out in California is has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper

#s2
Uh apparently you know there 's they have n't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe

#s6
Yeah

#s7
they

#s8
Well I we were we uh we just started we lived in Redwood City when we were out there

#s10
And uh and we found that uh you know it was a very liberal kind of community

#s11
But the uh I I really feel that that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars

#s12
and then they they uh uh you know lawyers these lawyer groups get together

#s13
and they uh they I think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process Uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years

#s14
Uh and I I think that uh that there 's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that

#s15
I think capital punishment uh uh was or probably stringent enough

#s16
but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way

#s18
Do do you feel as though there should be uh more uh was or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment

#s23
Uh-huh

#s27
Well the term technicality MUMBLEx

#s28
The law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous acts are done to uh to you know to get somebody into a a situation where they 're going to be guilty of of a crime

#s29
Or whether uh an- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impuned

#s30
Uh but or whether there 's just you know a policeman has just made a uh a you know a non a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it

#s31
but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker as being supportive

#s32
Now I I 'm a- a- at this juncture

#s33
I you know I 'm I 'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality

#s34
You know that that 's what all c- these these hearings are about

#s35
and that 's what all these you know court cases are about

#s36
I mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of out of the can

#s37
and uh you know he he tried to appeal his conviction

#s38
Uh and you know it did n't work

#s39
But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry

#s40
Uh in in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of Hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods

#s41
or you became a ward of somebody

#s42
and he you were his slave

#s43
And if he did n't like what you did he killed you

#s44
And that has that 's pretty effective

#s45
Uh you know it 's not good for civil rights I guess

#s46
but it 's pretty effective in that you know you 've got to get along in the community

#s47
and if you do n't you 'll perish Either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods

#s48
So I I I mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh imaginations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in so- in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing
