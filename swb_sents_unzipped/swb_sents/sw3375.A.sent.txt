#s1
Uh well I I guess it 's a subject I have n't thought too much about

#s2
Uh I do n't know if there 's so much wrong with the public schools uh as much as we 're expecting too much out of them

#s7
Minnesota Wisconsin

#s11
Yeah

#s13
Uh-huh

#s16
Yeah

#s17
Well it 's it is getting very expensive to run schools

#s18
so

#s20
They 've got computers now that you got to train on

#s21
There 's just so much uh more and less money to do it with

#s25
Right

#s26
Yeah

#s28
Yeah

#s29
yeah

#s30
I I I guess that in uh

#s31
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools I I think they 're expecting schools to discipline the kids

#s32
and uh I think it should go right back to the parents

#s33
If you do n't train your kids right then

#s38
Right

#s39
yeah

#s42
Yeah

#s43
yeah

#s44
I I know when I uh was going to school it was n't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving

#s47
I mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job

#s49
Yeah

#s50
yeah

#s53
Right

#s54
right

#s55
Yeah

#s56
It seems that 'd be a subject that I I do n't have much to say on

#s61
Yeah

#s65
Uh-huh

#s67
Yeah

#s76
Right

#s82
Right

#s83
Yeah

#s84
I do n't know

#s85
e- maybe they should sit back and and kind of uh decide on where the money 's best spent

#s86
I know in a lot of cases uh different districts like to have nice fancy schools

#s88
And maybe they should be a little more uh uh concerned with paying the right people to teach and and be uh satisfied with maybe a little older school

#s93
Uh-huh

#s97
Yeah

#s98
Yeah

#s99
Well I I know uh where I came from We did n't have a very uh rich community

#s100
and uh high school that I went to was very old

#s101
and uh as far as I know it 's still there

#s102
They 've e- expanded on it

#s103
but they 've never built a new one

#s104
and it 's probably fifty sixty years old or or better

#s105
and I do n't foresee them uh building a new one for a long time because they ca n't afford it
