Okay

#s3
Well did you go to college

#s6
And where did you go

#s8
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
I went to the University of Minnesota

#s18
I am

#s19
uh-huh

#s20
Where do you live now

#s23
Well I 'm in Texas

#s24
I 'm in Austin

#s29
Uh-huh

#s31
I 'm familiar with Plano

#s32
I visited once or twice

#s35
Oh I love it

#s36
I love it

#s37
I really do

#s39
That 's correct

#s40
I have two daughters

#s41
but my oldest will be will be a sophomore

#s43
She has her heart set on U T

#s44
And uh you know having gone to the University of Minnesota I know what a big university is like

#s45
And uh one thing that I did this summer which I thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band

#s46
and Baylor has a band camp

#s48
So she went for a week

#s49
and it was overnight

#s50
and they lived in the dorms

#s51
And I thought this would expose both of them to what it 's you know like on a coll- a smaller college campus

#s52
And uh my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school

#s53
So uh I I I still think the exposure was good

#s55
The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought well you know

#s56
what were your selection criteria

#s57
Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford

#s58
or you know there 's all of these areas to look at in making the decision

#s64
Oh wow

#s66
Oh definitely

#s69
Uh-huh

#s71
Oh how exciting

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
Oh that was That worked out very well for you

#s86
Well then he should come to U T

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Large classes

#s97
Oh I went from a large high school to a u- large university

#s98
and I definitely felt like I was a number

#s101
Uh I mean it is a different feeling

#s102
But that was that was my only option

#s103
I I mean I just really could n't look at anything else

#s104
That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a jun- you know a junior college which I did n't want to do

#s105
So that 's how you know my decision was made

#s106
But uh

#s112
Yes

#s121
What what does

#s122
he hopes to be a writer

#s127
Huh

#s129
Oh she she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions

#s131
Uh what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is

#s132
okay Bethany let 's be real

#s133
Uh she really is is pretty unfocussed at this point

#s134
And I do n't know

#s135
she 's taken a lot of French

#s136
and she may end up doing something with that

#s137
And I am a single mom

#s138
so I 've been

#s139
and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married

#s140
So I 'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake

#s141
And I 'm you know showing them if you 're strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money You know

#s143
I mean I 'm kind of really putting the practical application you know and and saying yet do something that you enjoy

#s145
By all means go get that piece of paper you know

#s146
Do you just have one son

#s148
I see

#s149
Well it sounds like he 's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do
