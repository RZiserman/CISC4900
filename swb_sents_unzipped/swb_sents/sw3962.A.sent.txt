#s1
Well uh what is your favorite kind of music

#s3
Oh same here

#s5
Yeah

#s8
Oh well I guess I like a wide range Uh everything from uh from Baroque through at least some modern music

#s10
And my wife and I these days are especially into opera

#s11
We 've been sort of opera fans for a few years now

#s13
Well we uh generally

#s14
the places we 've gone they sing in the original languages

#s16
Like the Dallas opera here normally does I guess

#s19
Well one thing that 's helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse- uh video tape

#s21
and so we have quite a collection of those

#s22
and you watch them at home

#s23
and they have subtitles

#s24
so you you figure out what 's going on after a while

#s25
and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater

#s27
But you know the uh Dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances I think

#s29
Well they they give an uh an English translation on a on a screen up above the stage

#s31
Yeah

#s33
In fact they even do that for operas sung sung in English because it is hard to understand the words sometimes

#s36
Yeah

#s37
well I really like Vivaldi

#s38
Uh he 's uh definitely one of the one of the top of that era

#s42
Uh-huh

#s48
Oh

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
How how old are they

#s54
So they 're doing this in school or what

#s56
Uh-huh

#s58
Well you 've got half a string quartet there

#s61
Yeah

#s63
Well since you seem to like uh Italian music have you ever uh gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era the uh period right before actually before Vivaldi I guess

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Oh yes

#s70
uh-huh

#s72
No

#s73
I do n't

#s74
but I think I know what it is

#s75
Is n't that a uh uh see

#s76
ca n't you get records through that or something recordings

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
Yes

#s82
yeah

#s83
I think uh

#s86
Uh

#s87
Uh yes

#s88
right

#s93
So they 're actually commissioned performances

#s96
Uh-huh

#s102
Uh-huh

#s103
Well I had go- heard good things about the uh Music Heritage Society

#s104
but if I get involved in one of those things I end up spending all my money on on music

#s107
I almost uh almost uh bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago

#s109
Yeah

#s110
my roommate signed me up

#s111
He got a bonus record

#s112
and I got a lot of bills

#s114
So we have to watch that

#s116
Uh do you play any instrument yourself
