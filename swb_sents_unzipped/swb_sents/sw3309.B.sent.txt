#s4
Well it 's kind of a broad subject uh

#s5
I I think there are some areas where we where we uh pretty well you know get our money 's worth

#s6
but I I also think there are a lot of areas especially in uh big government federal government uh where we 're short changed Uh lot of money spent for uh things that are not used

#s7
and uh I was I was in the Air Force

#s8
and I was at there were there was equipment at every base I was ever on that was just going to waste

#s9
It was just sitting and rusting

#s10
and you know and

#s14
Yeah

#s16
Yeah

#s19
Yeah

#s20
and I I think that uh it 's a a tone of our times that politicians uh are into themselves more than they are into you know doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which is really unfortunate

#s26
Yeah

#s29
Uh-huh

#s30
And do n't really respond to uh people who write them and call them

#s31
and uh you know unless they 're in the limelight and under pressure

#s32
So yeah

#s33
I think we get short changed on that

#s37
Texas

#s39
That 's

#s41
Well I work for school district

#s42
and uh it 's it has hurt us a lot

#s43
Uh there has to be some way I think to equalize education opportunities

#s44
But uh you know our we we tend to think I think e- especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it

#s45
And I do n't you know

#s46
that 's just not true

#s47
I do n't think the you know I do n't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or uh problem solving skills

#s48
Uh I think there are there are too many things that money ca n't uh that that money ca n't buy that that are important as far as education is concerned

#s51
Richardson

#s54
Oh

#s55
Great

#s56
okay

#s58
Yeah

#s60
Yeah

#s61
I think we 've uh Yeah we have got it on the line do n't we

#s64
And it 's not going to get any better

#s65
D- you know I mean it 's going up and up and up

#s66
Uh I used to live in the Plano school district

#s67
and uh there was a an organization a taxpayers organization that uh finally communicated the message to the I think to the people in Plano that you know we did n't want our taxes raised

#s70
Yeah

#s72
But this you know this uh

#s73
I think living in Richardson we 're kind of spoiled because I think we get we come closer to getting our money 's worth as far as the city is concerned I think than probably any any city in the country

#s76
Is that incredible

#s77
That 's that 's the biggest mess I 've ever heard of

#s78
You know how can you how can you justify raising anybody 's salary if you you know if you have to lay people off

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Yeah

#s85
Well yeah I think the teachers d- uh did

#s86
and I do n't know about administrators

#s87
I I 'm semiretired

#s88
and I was I was an administrator

#s89
so I you know I do n't get a raise anymore

#s90
I just I I work part-time and just get uh you know

#s92
my pay does n't change

#s94
Yes

#s96
Yes

#s97
very much

#s98
Uh course I I still work two part-time jobs
