#s1
Real excited when I heard this

#s2
So far I 've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment

#s3
so football I love this

#s5
This is great

#s6
Well we 're from Colorado

#s7
so we 're Bronco fans

#s8
And um we just moved here two years ago

#s9
and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here

#s10
and they lost again

#s11
That was pretty pitiful

#s12
but they seem to be doing pretty good this year

#s17
Oh

#s20
Yeah

#s23
Well they have n't they have n't have they just lost one game this year

#s25
Two

#s27
Yeah

#s28
But they 're not doing bad

#s29
People are pretty surprised that they I mean they beat the Giants

#s34
I bet

#s36
Oh boy I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it

#s40
Yep

#s44
Yeah

#s45
Yeah

#s46
well I am I 'm a big football fan

#s47
I never wou-

#s48
my father was a football fan my whole life

#s49
and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff

#s50
and I just hated it

#s51
And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays

#s53
And uh so when I met my husband he was watching football

#s54
and I figured out that I could n't see him all weekend

#s55
I could n't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL if I did n't like football

#s56
So

#s58
Yep

#s61
Uh-huh

#s62
uh-huh

#s64
Yeah

#s66
Uh-huh

#s67
Well I do

#s68
I just I love it

#s69
It 's such I just think it 's such a fun sport

#s70
And uh I 'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet

#s71
We 're not convinced that we 're going to be Cowboy fans yet

#s72
But uh

#s74
Well I guess we 'll first have to get to used to the idea that we 're staying here

#s76
That 's even harder

#s77
But

#s80
No

#s81
we 're just

#s82
this is only the second place we 've lived

#s83
We 've only been married for five and a half years

#s84
And uh we have two small children

#s85
and he had a uh just got transferred here to E-Systems

#s86
so

#s89
Oh

#s90
Well I tell you this

#s91
the weather here

#s92
and there 's no mountains or anything you know

#s93
and when you go to a football game in Colorado that 's you know there 's snow

#s94
and it 's an adventure

#s95
And here yeah you 've just got to drive down to the to the stadium

#s97
and uh

#s99
Yes

#s101
Well he 's from here

#s104
So Yeah

#s106
That 's what I hear

#s108
Which is rare

#s110
Which is good

#s111
Yeah

#s112
But uh I

#s113
you know it 's funny

#s114
in in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last I do n't know five or six years whatever it 's been Um they have these songs on the radio

#s115
They take moder- popular songs and and change them to fit uh the Broncos and stuff

#s117
And they had

#s118
I was just thinking about one the other day

#s119
Uh if I saw a picture of John Elway in the in the cafeteria at school um

#s120
but they did the Johnny Angel

#s121
They did Johnny Elway to that

#s123
And and I was trying to get my son to sing that

#s124
My husband was just having a fit

#s125
do n't have him sing that song

#s126
But they they do a lot of fun things

#s127
I think football is football is kind of a a sport that I think you kind of it 's hard not to like it

#s128
Because you know there 's just

#s130
It 's exciting

#s132
Yeah

#s136
Yeah

#s137
Yeah

#s138
they probabl-

#s139
I I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in uh Te- in Colorado

#s140
Because uh I I think about that a lot

#s141
But you know when I first moved here was when they well no I guess it was about a year ago they did this

#s142
This interstate seventy-five song Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything

#s144
That was kind of a funny song

#s145
but they sure do

#s146
it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here

#s147
Even when they were losing pitifully you know people still support them

#s148
We drive by some houses everyday that have big signs

#s149
we love the Cowbo-
