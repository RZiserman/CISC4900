Uh-huh

#s6
Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you 'd like

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
Uh-huh

#s15
Oh that 's right

#s16
You 're very close actually

#s17
It 's almost a uh bedroom community for the capital

#s24
Uh-huh

#s27
Yeah

#s28
A lot of my information comes from several sources

#s29
Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio Uh which I like

#s32
Uh I I think it 's fairly objective

#s33
and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative

#s34
And while there 's an inherent uh filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read uh I always figure it 's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of uh favoring the other side

#s35
That 's that 's potential indication of balance

#s36
And generally I really do believe they are pretty balanced

#s37
Uh I also read TIME magazine

#s38
and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the uh various uh of the articles and the front section

#s39
and uh

#s41
Oh

#s42
Oh you st-

#s43
did you use to live around here

#s46
Oh okay

#s47
Oh yeah

#s48
okay

#s49
I know exactly where that is

#s51
Yeah

#s52
we we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper

#s54
A-

#s55
the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I 've read it at times i- at

#s56
well the LOS ANGELES TIMES Which I 've found to be a uh a very good quality uh newspaper

#s58
and I like a lot of the articles there

#s59
Th- the other thing when you said

#s60
we do n't have cable T V

#s61
so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is is called C SPAN

#s66
Both

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s73
Oh I never say that

#s74
That would have been interesting

#s76
Yeah

#s77
I I think that 's always fascinating

#s78
I I wish we had something

#s86
But it 's usually the Prime Minister right

#s88
Thatcher

#s89
Major

#s93
Which could be another MUMBLEx of Monty Python

#s100
I I have seen that

#s101
and uh a aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in American politics uh which I really enjoy I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions I think

#s102
And it 's unlike the fairly controlled uh press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they they always seem
