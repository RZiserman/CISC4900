Well I do love to fish

#s6
Well I do n't know how much you can learn

#s7
I 'm not so sure I 'm good at it

#s8
but I do enjoy doing it

#s10
Yeah

#s17
Well I hope it is

#s18
there 's not a whole lot of different kinds

#s20
I do n't do a lot of deep sea fishing I because I get seasick

#s21
but we have a lot of lakes here in this area

#s24
and I do a lot of fishing for uh bass

#s25
We have a lot of uh uh couple of lakes in our area that are fil- just filled with good sized bass

#s27
And then when I get tired of them outwitting me I fish for catfish

#s29
and we use worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows

#s31
and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms

#s33
It all depends on what I 'm fishing for and the time of day

#s35
I do

#s36
Uh there 's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here

#s37
and it 's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think

#s39
Fishing 's a good way to do that

#s40
and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing

#s42
No

#s43
I do n't

#s44
I have a friend who has a little infla- inflatable raft

#s45
and we use that sometimes

#s48
I wish I had a boat

#s49
but I do n't

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Right

#s55
That 's the same way here is n't it

#s57
You have to get back in the sticks in the

#s64
Right

#s66
Oh

#s68
We do n't have We do n't have a big problem with turtles

#s70
but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes

#s72
And I Well I ca n't think of a time that I 've been fishing that I have n't run into one or two of them

#s74
No

#s75
we uh

#s76
occasionally I 'll catch an eel on a on a hook but never the snakes

#s78
They just kind of

#s80
Uh we have a lot of cotton mouth

#s81
so yes

#s82
they are definitely

#s84
and they live in little shallow little coves that I like to fish in

#s85
so I seem them swimming by every once in a while

#s88
Yeah

#s89
they can they 're they 're certainly ugly

#s98
Yeah

#s100
Definitely

#s102
Do you have bass

#s105
Right

#s106
Well that 's pretty much the same way here

#s108
I

#s110
Well we have those

#s111
I do n't

#s113
I inevitably if I enter one of those I never catch a thing

#s115
I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it

#s124
Oh yes

#s128
Yeah

#s129
oh definitely

#s131
Certainly here they are

#s134
Yeah

#s135
it 's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish

#s137
That 's what I do a lot
