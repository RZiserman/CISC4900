Well I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by uh General ex uh Surgeon General Koop

#s5
And he talked about Canada 's system

#s6
and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that

#s7
but the expensive stuff heart uh operations and things they have a managed scarcity

#s8
And they said that in Canada there were as many heart uh trauma centers as there is in San Francisco

#s9
So in one city of in America there 's as many uh hospitals that are equipped to do hosp- uh heart operations as in the entire area of Canada

#s10
and that 's kind of spooky

#s19
Uh-huh

#s23
Do you think that it 's just uh medical guys

#s24
What about you know you know how expensive new equipment and technology is

#s25
That 's where I think most of the cost is coming

#s30
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s47
Oh great

#s52
Yeah

#s59
Uh-huh

#s68
No

#s69
Yeah

#s70
I 'll have to agree with you there

#s72
but there 's another problem

#s73
and that 's the how litigious our society is

#s74
If the doctor makes a mistake he can be sure that he 's going to be hauled into court

#s82
Uh-huh

#s97
No

#s98
it does n't
