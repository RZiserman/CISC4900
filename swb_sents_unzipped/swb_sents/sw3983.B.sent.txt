#s3
We take several at home

#s4
I I take um SKIING MAGAZINE

#s5
and I take uh DISCOVER magazine and also uh C D AND STEREO REVIEW and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC I think and BOYS LIFE

#s12
I presume that I do

#s14
Uh I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because I do get things from ski associations and things uh at during the year

#s18
Uh not so much that

#s19
I uh

#s20
more likely to see those at a ski show or something

#s21
but um I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and and new equipment that 's come out and so forth

#s23
Some fashions are always in there too

#s28
Probably not

#s29
Uh we already knew we wanted to take one

#s30
and we just started looking around

#s31
I may have referred to a couple of them

#s32
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to Crested Butte

#s35
We have n't been there before

#s37
Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one

#s39
It 's supposedly low lift lines

#s41
But I have n't skied Utah yet

#s42
but I want to

#s44
I 'd like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those

#s46
I understand Deer Valley is nice too

#s52
Well how about you

#s53
what what magazines do you have at home

#s60
Oh okay

#s61
Does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth

#s69
Well that 's good

#s70
It 's good to get use out of one

#s72
I 'm not sure that um in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC

#s73
I mean I read it

#s74
but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time

#s76
but then eventually there 'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know France or something or whatever it is he 's looking for

#s83
I used to take SMITHSONIAN too

#s85
I liked that magazine

#s87
but it was I was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it

#s89
You get so many coming in

#s90
and by the time the next round comes in I 'm still not through reading the first round

#s92
Oh SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house too

#s93
I forgot

#s94
and that 's mostly my son 's

#s96
but but I do read it too

#s99
And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE MAGAZINE which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that

#s103
he likes to try that

#s104
so He does uh

#s105
does get to be a lot of paper though

#s106
after a while if you do n't keep them weeded out they almost take over

#s112
Oh yeah

#s113
they 're just kind of getting started now

#s116
Mine is a senior in high school

#s117
so he 's we 're kind of at the end of that trail

#s119
You 're just sort of beginning to think about first grade

#s126
Oh okay

#s127
so you got a little bit of a gap there between
