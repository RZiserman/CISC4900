#s18
Oh

#s20
Well I have uh a nine year old and a six year old

#s21
and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working

#s24
but uh they both went through preschool

#s26
And uh we 've just been real lucky I think anyway To not

#s30
Right

#s31
like half day programs

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s57
that is uh a big drawback I think in that in the uh public schools out here You know to

#s59
you 're lucky to have an art teacher

#s60
and if you do you get them once a week or something you know

#s65
Oh is that right

#s66
I had no idea

#s69

#s74
Oh my goodness

#s76
Yeah

#s77
That 's true

#s78
Well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool

#s79
and then when they hit kindergarten you know it 's like wham Culture shock

#s82
It 's just

#s84
Yeah

#s85
yeah

#s86
Get the computers out

#s88
and you know

#s90
That 's hard

#s92
It 's so difficult for them

#s93
Um did you have your children did you say in home in in private care

#s94

#s99

I was just listening to a program this morning

#s131
oh well I guess it was on the HOME SHOW

#s132
but they were talking about uh a new uh

#s133
oh I ca n't even think of the name of it

#s134
I was halfway listening while I was painting

#s136
Um it 's some kind of advisory board they 've put together for parents and children

#s138
and they 've now moved it to Washington D C

#s139
and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know I ca n't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care and leaving them there

Well and I would think you know since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know the the people that work in big business have families

#s181
they have children

#s183
So it 's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working

#s185
and uh

#s188
Uh-huh

#s189

#s198
I have a couple of friends that have have found the uh you know a pri- a private home to take their children to when they 're young until they hit the preschool age

#s201
And they

#s202
usually you know you 'll find a a woman that 's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home

#s204
and my future future sister-in-law 's mother does that too full-time

#s208
Uh-huh
