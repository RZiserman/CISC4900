Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them

#s2
or or or what do you think

#s14
Uh-huh

#s15
See I never thought really it 's uh I never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we 're paying too much or too little

#s16
I I always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment

#s17
For instance like Social Security tax or Soc- uh

#s18
I mean that 's that 's tax

#s19
we 're paying money

#s20
and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us

#s22
So that 's

#s23
yeah you know

#s24
when I when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week I or each every other week I I really think that money 's history

#s25
and you know so as far as return investment that 's not that 's nothing

#s27
and we 're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back

#s28
Uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there 's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio which

#s29
I may be wrong

#s30
but I believe that the cure for polio is already founded

#s31
but but supposedly once you have an office in D C or you know and and staff it with people it 's really tough to close it down

#s32
and and they just have n't yet

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Well that might be the difference

#s39
I do n't know

#s40
Uh the other thing that uh I remember seeing on T V lately is uh had to do with

#s41
it 's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically

#s43
that that histor- for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians

#s46
Uh-huh

#s48
So it sounds like you uh you think that that we 'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto

#s52
Yeah

#s54
Uh-huh

#s59
Yeah

#s61
Pork barrel politics

#s67
Yeah

#s68
but Massachusetts was n't when Dukakis was there anyway was n't in that great shape financially

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
I mean I do n't know

#s73
I

#s79
It 's uh I mean it 's it 's tough

#s80
I mean there 's there 's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations

#s81
I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot

#s82
or you can hope that if people keep their money that they 'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot
