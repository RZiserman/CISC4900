#s4
Well I have n't either uh

#s5
I I hate returning things

#s7
I mean I I have a friend who if she likes something is n't sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and you know take everything back again

#s9
It 's you know it 's a game to her

#s10
but I I do not like to do that

#s11
I consider it kind of a a waste of my time

#s12
And so I 'm usually uh pretty careful when I shop

#s14
and I also you know usually have have checked over things you know if it 's like an appliance or something to make sure uh it has the features in it that I want

#s16
Now we 've had one lately um oh a uh a Dustbuster Plus that we bought

#s18
and we 've had it for a while

#s19
but all of a sudden it just was n't working

#s20
and it looks like there 's a part missing from it

#s21
My husband opened it up and whatever

#s22
and of course we do n't have the receipt any more

#s23
so we ca n't take it back

#s26
Uh but I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long

#s28
uh

#s32
Yeah

#s34
Well that 's true

#s35
and lot of times though it is it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know if it 's

#s43
Uh-huh

#s47
Well yeah

#s48
I think a lot of times if you get a brand name uh you know if it 's a a good brand

#s50
I you I think there 's there can be a lemon in anything

#s51
but uh I think more often than not

#s53
you you pretty well know what you 're getting ahead of time

#s54
and uh you know if you buy a good one you should n't have any you know too much of a problem with it

#s56
I mean we we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do

#s59
We never could get it declared a lemon

#s60
and the car would go

#s61
and without any warning whatsoever you could be going down the freeway at sixty

#s62
and it would stop

#s64
and I

#s65
there was just

#s66
you know and oh we went round and round with the manufacturer and and everything

#s67
and they got it finally semifixed

#s68
but it was such a hassle

#s71
yeah

#s72
yeah

#s73
it it really is uh

#s74
but gee this is of all the topics I have had I 'm doing this thing this is kind of the strangest one

#s78
Uh-huh

#s80
Well I think that 's true

#s81
and I uh now we generally do n't buy a warranty because you think you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s94
Ye- I think technology is better

#s95
I 'm I 'm not sure

#s96
I think you 've got a good point with the plastic and that

#s98
I do n't think necessarily that things are being made better uh you know

#s100
I I

#s101
everything is so automated uh

#s102
and things can be made without I think a human hand ever touching it you know an awful lot of things

#s105
and I think that certainly makes a difference from back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and you know had some pride in it

#s109
Well yeah

#s110
that 's that 's true

#s113
Yeah

#s114
well I I do uh you know craft work and sell stuff at shows

#s115
and that and uh uh you know it 's it 's it 's a real eye-opener as far as you know why people charge what they do to you know
