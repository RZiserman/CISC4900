Okay

#s2
I guess tonight 's subject is uh woodworking

#s4
Do you uh

#s5
Well k- kind of mainly the woodworking I 've done lately is uh made like uh for example a little nativity scene

#s6
Uh not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable

#s7
put some shelves in

#s8
and and some odd stuff around the house

#s10
and so I I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking

#s11
and I do it out of hobby more than uh you know something I have to do

#s12
How about yourself

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Well I 'll have to come and see them

#s25
That sounds like a good idea

#s26
I you know

#s27
and that 's that is right

#s28
it is out of necessity because lot of the things that uh well we ca n't be able to afford

#s29
but also I I sometimes think that uh I enjoy doing that

#s30
and I like to get out and and uh to work with my hands

#s31
and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too

#s32
Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools

#s36
Uh-huh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s41
Oh a entertainment type center

#s43
Oh

#s46
Right

#s47
Right

#s48
right

#s52
Right

#s53
or yes

#s54
I

#s55
yeah

#s56
I 'm aware of that

#s58
And also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge And Uh And uh casings and so forth that are that are real nice

#s62
so that 's that 's good

#s63
That 's good

#s65
Yeah

#s67
Oh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s75
Yeah

#s77
Well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you would n't be able to do that

#s78
Uh but uh yeah

#s79
a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment

#s81
And

#s86
Uh-huh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s90
No

#s91
they do n't have basements

#s92
Well I 'm from up north also

#s93
and and uh no

#s94
there 's no basements down here

#s95
and it 's kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that

#s97
Yeah

#s98
lot of the equipment too that I 've I 've used in the past uh I w- you know I 've used in school

#s99
and uh I would

#s100
I do n't know

#s101
I 'd I 'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice uh pieces of uh well wood for for different things for tables for for uh chairs for you know decks and so forth

#s102
so I do n't know

#s104
I I just enjoy woodworking

#s105
and I think the the main thing is like you say it 's a it 's a good out

#s106
It 's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day

#s107
and it 's a great stress stress reliever

#s109
Yes

#s110
I have in school I have

#s111
and I 've made uh uh different things uh la- uh tables for chairs

#s112
and I 've made uh bowls

#s113
and uh and uh
