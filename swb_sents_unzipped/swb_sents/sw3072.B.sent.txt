Okay

#s4
Recently

#s5
my most recent trip was last year

#s6
and that was Detroit

#s8
Yeah

#s10
Well it was n't really

#s11
It was um uh to see an old relative

#s14
And it was uh just to uh have some fellowship with her

#s17
No

#s18
The only thing that I I visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is Cancun Mexico

#s20
And that was real nice Uh

#s22
No

#s23
we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there

#s25
Yeah

#s26
and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine

#s31
Huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
Yes

#s36
Oh that 's always refreshing to get away from

#s40
Oh well that 's nice

#s41
Yeah

#s45
Well my uh my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity

#s46
and that 's canoeing

#s48
And uh they 've been to the Guadalupe River

#s49
and they also uh uh have been to uh I guess Colorado

#s50
and they 've really enjoyed it

#s53
It 's a whole new

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Huh

#s65
Sure

#s66
Uh-huh

#s70
Oh that 's neat

#s71
Sure

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Well you learn a lot of um skills too

#s77
and I think you 're more receptive when you 're younger than when you 're older to learn new skills

#s79
and I think they really it really pen- penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it Because it 's something you were n't forced to do

#s82
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning

#s84
And you 're more receptive

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Oh that 's exciting

#s93
Uh-huh

#s104
Well I had a friend that uh visited England not well I think it 's been probably two years now

#s105
but that 's her next goal and she can do it is go back to England

#s106
because she really has a great desire to do that

#s107
because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it
