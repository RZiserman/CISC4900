#s1
Uh well uh to begin

#s2
I guess uh space is uh real important I think

#s3
so it 's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time I guess

#s4
So

#s7
Uh

#s9
So uh

#s10
but uh I 'm not too up-to-date on the space on the space frontier

#s11
but uh I guess they 're going going pretty far into it now

#s12
Um Star Wars is not too far I do n't think

#s13
But uh

#s15
Oh have you

#s17
So what do you know about it

#s25
Really

#s26
Oh my gosh

#s30
Wow

#s31
Well I do n't know

#s32
You think you 'd you think you 'd uh go up in space if you had a chance

#s34
Do you

#s37
I think I would just sitting here talking about it

#s38
but if the time came it 'd be real nervous

#s39
I 'd be scared

#s40
scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster

#s41
That 'd be pretty hairy

#s44
Yeah

#s45
imagine

#s47
Right

#s48
right

#s49
So well I guess they 're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now wherever And opening up those stations whatever filling them

#s53
I do n't know if we 'll ever see that up there

#s55
Oh really

#s58
That 's all beyond my imagination really

#s60
But science fiction books

#s61
I mean you look at the Jetsons you know cartoon show

#s62
and it 's not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons

#s63
so you never know

#s66
Any of that stuff from the Jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would come become possible

#s67
and now you we have a lot of those

#s68
so

#s70
So you never know what what may occur

#s71
but as far as me seeing it you know I do n't know

#s73
I do n't know

#s74
but I think it 's real vital important for the future you know generations to come

#s76
so

#s81
Yeah

#s83
I 'm sure it 'll draw a lot more interest too once it becomes you know like it 's more possible

#s84
but when they start showing the drawings and all that I 'm sure you know when they

#s89
Right

#s90
Uh-huh

#s93
So did they scratch those uh that Star Wars deal you know they one we was all worried about Russia and all that

#s98
Yeah

#s99
but the economy the way it is all over they probably cut back on on that because it 's not

#s102
Right

#s103
Yeah

#s104
I know

#s105
and then

#s108
Yeah

#s109
and we do n't know who 's handling them now

#s111
so that 's a whole different story now

#s113
Oh really

#s118
Uh-huh

#s124
Some crazy hit man over there

#s125
so with those little republican- republics or whatever

#s126
they splitting it all up now

#s127
and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it

#s129
you never know

#s130
But that the guy that 's taken over for Gorbachev he 's supposed to be he 's supposed to be on our side is n't he

#s131
Pretty much

#s133
Uh-huh

#s134
I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects

#s135
so

#s137
But that way you ca n't never tell that

#s139
Kiss some butt

#s140
but but uh
