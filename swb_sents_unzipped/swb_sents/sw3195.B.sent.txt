#s3
Well I we talk about it

#s4
but I 'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh

#s8
Um yes

#s10
Yes

#s14
I do n't mind the spending

#s15
it 's just that trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have

#s16
That seems to be our challenge

#s19
I see

#s21
Well I 'm I 'm at home also

#s22
so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary uh

#s24
Well we pretty well do

#s25
Um several years we did n't

#s26
and we found that we just were n't making the most of what we had

#s27
and so we we um set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for you know

#s28
just our bills

#s29
And then what 's left we divvy up

#s30
We try to save a little bit although we 're not always successful

#s31
and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs

#s36
Yeah

#s37
Right

#s41
Right

#s42
Uh-huh

#s46
Right

#s51
Yeah

#s54
Right

#s57
Well we had new cars um always until about four years ago

#s58
my husband um owned his own company

#s59
and it went under

#s60
and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment

#s61
and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car

#s62
well he has a company car also

#s63
but for our personal car we have a used car

#s64
Um do you think that it 's wiser to buy used

#s69
Right

#s74
Uh-huh

#s78
Oh no

#s80
Uh-huh

#s84
That 's right

#s87
Wow

#s92
Right

#s95
Do you um buy from dealers or from individuals

#s98
Right

#s99
Right

#s104
Yeah
