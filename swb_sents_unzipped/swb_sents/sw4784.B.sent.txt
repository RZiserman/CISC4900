What is it that you are you know particularly upset about

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they would n't get in a the public school system

#s20
So you 're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of uh real estate or other taxes

#s21
and and consequently they 're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they 'd like to see them happen

#s24
Uh-huh

#s31
Right

#s35
Right

#s36
It troubles me too tha- that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good

#s37
and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that uh you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level

#s40
Uh it means that you 've got to be informed

#s41
and you 've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision

#s46
Right

#s49
Right

#s50
It has taken on a more profound and you 'd think we 'd notice it economic uh thrust

#s51
Yeah

#s58
Well I 'm glad that you added that one

#s59
Yeah

#s60
I think that one 's significant

#s69
Right

#s70
Well I I g- agree with everything that you 've said so far

#s71
and the only that I 'd want to add is that I 'm a little more in contact I think with public school teachers than perhaps you are uh except as a parent of your child

#s72
and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing

#s73
and they are the three things that you mentioned

#s74
But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related

#s77
like consumer
