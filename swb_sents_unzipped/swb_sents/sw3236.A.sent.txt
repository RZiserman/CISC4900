#s1
Why do n't you go ahead and say what you feel

#s2
and then I 'll respond

#s9
Yeah

#s11
Well how long have you been here

#s14
Well

#s16
Yeah

#s18
Yeah

#s19
I think that 's a good excuse

#s20
You need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things

#s23
We 've been here probably two and a half years

#s24
and and we did n't recycle at all before we came

#s26
so I think we 're doing well

#s27
We we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now

#s30
Well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart

#s31
They have um in behind Walmart they have bins

#s33
and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Um there 's a place on Parker Road um

#s39
it 's just over the overpass before you get like to K-Mart

#s40
I think there 's a a service station there

#s41
There 's usually a semi truck that has a a person there that will weigh them

#s42
and Now they are n't worth much right now

#s44
but it 's better than nothing

#s46
so

#s49
and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now

#s50
and we hopefully we 'll be getting them in the month of October

#s54
Yeah

#s55
and I think it 's been delayed

#s57
I think it was originally scheduled for February

#s58
but the trucks that were supposed to do it there 's been some problems with from what I 've read in you know the mail that we get

#s61
and I ca n't wait for that

#s62
that will be easy

#s63
I get tired of newspaper littering the garage

#s67
I feel guilty we do n't recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste

#s69
Yeah

#s71
yeah

#s72
they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can

#s74
so I 'll be glad when the bins do come

#s75
and I think that 's when I 'll I 'll start doing the plastic too

#s81
Yeah

#s82
I 've gotten used to washing the you know the um salad dressing bottles and things like that

#s84
it 's not that big of a deal

#s85
and it 's nicer to just throw them out

#s86
but we can do our part take an extra minute or two

#s90
Oh when we first were were here it was like we 'd take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full

#s92
and it would be like two dollars

#s93
but since last time we 've gotten more like a dollar

#s96
Yeah

#s98
which is understandable

#s99
I think more people are are recycling

#s102
That 's something we we do n't really make any effort to

#s103
and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans

#s105
and that was kind of fun

#s106
but we have n't done that for a long time

#s108
so

#s110
Well the boys think it 's fun

#s111
plus you get your exercise

#s112
and you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest

#s113
so

#s115
but

#s120
Well hopefully the bins will be here in this month

#s121
and that will spur you on

#s122
so

#s127
All right well it sounds like we 're doing our part and at least starting Trying

#s129
that 's all you can do

#s132
so

#s135
Um yeah

#s136
you can do it as long as you want

#s137
They you know

#s138
if it 's been long enough

#s139
five minutes is is when they cut in and say say we do n't have any more room for recording

#s141
So we can say good-bye now

#s143
It was good talking to you

#s144
and maybe we 'll get on line again

#s146
Thanks Sherry

#s148
Bye-bye
