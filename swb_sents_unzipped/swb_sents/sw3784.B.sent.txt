Well as far as I 'm concerned and it 's probably apt that your call 's at this time because we just got through watching uh REASONABLE DOUBTS Which had a you know capital case in it

#s3
And uh m- I personally have uh

#s4
my own feelings about uh capital punishment is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony

#s6
Mandatory I mean summary execution on the steps that day

#s10
Uh-huh

#s13
Well I I also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation

#s15
But I do know that some people almost all people usually die before that point

#s17
They just get too old

#s19
Uh as far as capital punishment on on it 's own merits I have the trouble with the way it 's applied

#s20
I think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner

#s21
Uh and I 've I 've said this very often

#s22
and I believe it to be the a very true axiom

#s23
so I would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent Because if you 're if you 're black and you kill a white guy you 're going to fry

#s26
Kill you They will kill you

#s28
And if you 're black and you kill a black guy you know it 's you know two hundred hours of community service

#s31
Well it 's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship you know

#s34
We 're the majority

#s35
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do

#s37
And you 're the minority

#s38
and you 're stuck with it

#s40
But uh you know we had this in the Vietnam war you know

#s41
we had you know

#s42
population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent

#s44
But the population of blacks in the military was about twenty-two percent

#s46
The handwriting 's on the wall there is n't it

#s49
You know but that 's another issue altogether

#s52
As far as capital punishment I think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment

#s53
I think the guy should have ninety days

#s54
and if he ca n't produce evidence not argument but evidence

#s60
Well

#s61
Th- that goes back to when uh America was a a colony of England

#s63
In England you went to court

#s64
you were assumed guilty until proven innocent

#s65
and once they found you guilty you know judge said he 's guilty

#s66
kill him

#s67
Well th- there were some people that uh that had a problem with that Because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed

#s70
And he 'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me

#s72
And uh or he 'll have somebody lie for him

#s73
You know people lie

#s74
it 's a strange thing

#s76
but they do that

#s77
and to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap

#s80
And the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy

#s81
Look at that guy uh at E Systems

#s83
They were g- they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit

#s85
He was too far away when it happened

#s86
He had witnesses that were you know

#s87
they were n't dope dealers

#s88
they were n't drug fiends

#s89
they were employees of a an establishment that had a very high level of security sense too

#s90
And these were really responsible people

#s92
You know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy

#s93
They all look the same to me you know

#s95
Big lips flat nose

#s96
yep

#s97
that was him
