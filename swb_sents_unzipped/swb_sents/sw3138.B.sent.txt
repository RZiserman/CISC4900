#s1
Okay

#s2
I guess we 're going to discuss food and cooking

#s4
Do you enjoy cooking

#s6
I 'm kind of that way too

#s7
When I have I I enjoy cooking when I have time

#s9
I do n't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday

#s12
It gets kind of boring

#s14
How big is the family you cook for

#s16
Uh-huh

#s17
We have four

#s18
so and two of them are teenage boys

#s19
so

#s22
Are they

#s24


#
Yeah

#s26
Yeah

#s27
we have that problem too

#s29
But also now it 's just the amount that they eat

#s30
It 's just absolutely incredible

#s34
Yeah

#s35
Does he

#s37
MUMBLEx

#s38
Yeah

#s39
That 's true

#s40
Uh do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal Favorite recipes that you 've come across or

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Out on the grill

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Ooh

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56


#
Ooh yeah

#s61
Ooh that 's sound good

#s62
I love that

#s63
My husband really likes seafood

#s66
Um and MUMBLEx I think that no matter what I do I do n't serve enough of it really to uh to suit him

#s67
I did n't grow up eating that much seafood

#s68
and uh so I do n't know

#s69
it 's just kind of not natural to me

#s70
but I like it

#s72
And uh I do n't know

#s73
one of his favorite things is uh

#s74
well it 's called seafood stew

#s75
and it 's really it 's really like a s- soup that that you serve over rice

#s77
And uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it

#s78
And

#s80
No

#s81
no

#s82
That 's kind of Louisiana I think if you do that

#s84
Yeah

#s87
I do n't either

#s88
But uh

#s89
no

#s90
this is just re- it is really good

#s91
and and one thing that 's good is it makes the a large amount

#s92
And so I 've usually we eat one

#s93
and I freeze two containers of it

#s95
Then that 's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice

#s96
But neither of my kids will eat it You know

#s98
so then they eat a pizza or

#s102
Yeah

#s103
it really does

#s104
One thing I 've run across recently though

#s105
a friend gave me a recipe that I really like for chicken enchiladas

#s107
Have you made them

#s110
Does he ooh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s117
Yeah

#s119
Well are these are done with a flour tortilla

#s120
Is that what he uses

#s122
Yeah

#s130
Is n't that something

#s131
Yeah

#s133
I was going to say my kids both eat it

#s134
I guess that 's one thing that I particularly like um

#s135
But I think it 's good for you know for for company too

#s136
and I 've made it a few times

#s137
Um and you can make a lot at one time when I needed to make something to uh to give somebody You know like you know to take over to somebody 's house or something else

#s143
It it 's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family

#s144
and then

#s147
Uh-huh

#s149
What what does it have in it

#s153
Uh-huh

#s154
Sure

#s155
Uh-huh

#s159
Yeah

#s162
Uh-huh

#s163
Sure

#s165
Sometimes those are the best ones

#s169
Uh-huh

#s170
Uh-huh

#s171
Uh-huh

#s174
Yeah

#s175
Ooh that sounds good

#s178
Uh-huh

#s180
Oh yeah

#s181
Those are good are n't they

#s182
Uh-huh

#s184
Um

#s186
That sounds good

#s188
Right

#s190
You cook the rice before you put it in

#s192
Yeah

#s194
I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good

#s197
I guess I would now use the the new mayonnaise free

#s200
Yeah

#s201
That 's really wonderful that they 're coming out with so many new things like that because like I told my husband this summer I love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that

#s204
and and you know basically it certainly a l- low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing

#s206
You know and now it 's it 's it 's okay

#s207
and you can even

#s208
I used to just put a tiny bit in

#s209
Well now I 'm just putting more and more in

#s211
Yeah

#s212
and it 's only it used to be like a hun- hundred calories per tablespoon

#s213
and now it 's like twelve

#s215
Oh

#s217
I just think that 's the best thing to have happened

#s218
I 'm just so excited about that

#s219
Anyway Yeah

#s225
Yes

#s227
Right

#s230
Uh-huh

#s231
Uh-huh

#s233
Yeah

#s235
That 's when they As our family would say a pig out

#s237
That 's good

#s239
Oh one of my boys that that 's twelve um is has high cholesterol

#s241
Have you ever found out about your kids

#s244
Um and my other one does not

#s246
So oh year or so ago he found out

#s247
and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down And did

#s248
He was able to get it down

#s249
It 's I think it 's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol

#s251
He 's never eaten any eggs

#s252
He 's never had anything but skim milk

#s253
and you know I 've never bought butter and things like that

#s255
But um oh he just left for the doctor again

#s256
and it 's it 's kind of back up

#s257
Um so he needs to be careful again

#s259
So we 've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat

#s261
and uh so he 's eating an apple a day for the last two days

#s262
And all that kind of stuff does really help

#s263
Well I think we 've probably talked long enough

#s264
and

#
