#s1
Uh I get most of my news uh from newspapers really

#s2
I read the daily newspaper uh the HOUSTON CHRONICLE

#s3
and sometimes I 'll read like the uh WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES

#s4
I do n't subscribe to either

#s5
but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it

#s6
Uh how about you

#s7
Do you uh mostly get things from T V or MUMBLEx

#s12
Oh

#s13
Oh that 's interesting

#s14
You said computer networks

#s15
Uh what uh what sort

#s16
I am fairly knowledgeable of MUMBLEx

#s18
Uh okay

#s19
That 's interesting

#s24
Oh

#s25
I-

#s26
is it is it the A P news wire

#s27
or is it something that is uh a little bit different from that

#s30
Uh okay

#s31
So that 's that 's interesting

#s32
Okay

#s33
Yeah

#s34
I 've had I had access in the past to uh uh the A P news wire

#s35
and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news

#s36
Uh I 've never used the DOW JONES news wire

#s37
but uh

#s38
yeah

#s39
it uh

#s40
do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach

#s46
Yeah

#s48
In what way

#s49
In like in sort of like uh qual- uh quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever

#s54
Yeah

#s55
Well you wo n't offend me

#s56
So go ahead and say

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Like a liberal type of bias

#s64
Yeah

#s66
Yeah

#s67
Yeah

#s69
They they generally make mistake on anything technical at least

#s74
Yeah

#s75
Yeah

#s76
Do you by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes

#s77
or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things

#s80
Yeah

#s81
Yeah

#s82
Yeah

#s83
Yeah

#s86
Huh

#s87
Huh

#s88
That 's disturbing

#s90
I have n't really noticed them doing that

#s91
but whatever

#s92
again I do n't watch T V news that much now

#s93
If I had access to C N N I would watch T V news more

#s94
Uh I do n't you know but I do n't usually

#s100
Yeah

#s101
Did you did you think that C N N well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh an abnormality

#s102
I just wonde- I guess

#s103
I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks Uh you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever

#s104
but I I guess you would n't

#s105
You probably

#s106
if you just watched it during the Gulf War that probably would n't would n't tell you much

#s109
Yeah

#s111
Yeah
