Uh I guess my personal opinion I I do n't mind paying taxes necessarily

#s2
I I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way

#s4
Uh sometimes when I hear what what they 're even what even what the politicians are making you know when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that uh I think that 's just a bit too much to be paying them uh

#s5
and that 's all tax money

#s6
When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it 's just billions of dollars

#s7
that 's I think is just being thrown away

#s12
Yeah

#s14
Yeah

#s16
Yeah

#s18
Yeah

#s21
Yeah

#s22
yeah

#s23
Well I know any time there 's there 's a big uh budget cut you know

#s24
I work with the state

#s25
and any time there 's there is a budget cut or crunches it 's always the small guy that that gets hurt

#s27
It 's never the uh the person that 's making a hundred thousand there

#s28
It 's always the person that 's making the least amount

#s29
and uh and sometimes we 're running around there

#s31
I see these these uh supervisors running around uh having meetings

#s32
I I really do n't know what they do

#s34
I sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything

#s35
or

#s45
Yeah

#s48
Yeah

#s49
Well they got so many hidden taxes that it 's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store something like that and you 're paying a little tax here

#s50
and you

#s52
so

#s53
Gas I do n't know about you guys

#s54
but there 's probably at least about twenty-five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas

#s56
And you do n't realize

#s62
Yeah

#s67
Yeah

#s68
Well I know they say like with Reagan they say no new taxes

#s69
but they changed the uh deductions on you

#s70
and that just raises your taxes you know

#s71
they just get it a different way

#s73
so I mean to me it did uh raise my taxes

#s77
Yeah

#s78
I heard someone say that uh if they would just something about with the uh the defense budget all that extra money they 're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
