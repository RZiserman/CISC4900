So what kind of music you into

#s4
The opera yeah it 's right on track

#s5
I like classical

#s6
but I ca n't deal with opera at all

#s7
And heavy metal uh it 's noisy

#s8
I 'm into uh some industrial music that 's a a bit even harder than that

#s10
But it 's it 's got to have a point to it

#s13
Yeah

#s14
What kind of progressive stuff

#s18
uh

#s21
Oh yeah

#s22
Yeah

#s23
it 's a lot of people l- like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out

#s25
I think that 's pretty much you know bull

#s26
Because R E M really has n't changed

#s27
If

#s28
it 's it 's interesting

#s29
They 're producing uh similar music

#s30
and it 's good music

#s32
but you know people have picked up on it

#s33
That 's good

#s35
I 'm impressed

#s39
Oh yeah

#s41
Uh but he picked the right songs

#s42
and and that that 's about all he had going for him Or still has for that matter

#s45
Oh yeah

#s46
Yeah

#s47
I 'm sure that that so- that sold a lot for him

#s48
That 's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop

#s49
I 'm ki- I 've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop

#s50
It just seems like there 's no no real point

#s51
You hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises

#s53
and

#s55
Uh-huh

#s59
Yeah

#s60
I can I can believe that

#s61
What kind of things are you do you like in classical

#s62
What 's the standard

#s70
Oh yes

#s73
Uh-huh

#s80
It 's safe
