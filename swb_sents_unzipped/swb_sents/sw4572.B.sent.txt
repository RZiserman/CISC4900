Ooh well I do n't know

#s3
What do you think

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
uh-huh

#s14
Huh

#s15
Well what about uh required drug testing uh as a uh condition of employment

#s20
It MUMBLEx thing actually

#s21
Uh I uh have worked at Texas Instruments

#s23
And uh they instituted a drug policy there Drug testing policy where they randomly would test uh employees

#s25
and actually to tell you the truth I really did not think much about it

#s26
I I had n't you know

#s27
it really did n't relate to me

#s28
But there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have

#s30
And also uh uh this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing this kind of big brother activity

#s31
and yet uh a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they do n't admit to it it 's actually oh a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure

#s33
So what that means is to me that really it 's the government that 's requiring this

#s34
although they do n't actually e- execute it themselves it 's really the government that MUMBLEx

#s35
So in that sense it at least philosophically it 's really borderline legal

#s40
Well what about this uh AIDS epidemic now Where you find that uh uh you know certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for others

#s42
Yeah

#s43
and and uh of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it does n't

#s44
it uh it destroys their libido

#s46
Now uh you know if they ever

#s48
So what about that as an invasion of privacy

#s51
So really

#s52
it i- gets to balancing uh personal freedom against uh the general welfare of society

#s55
Well it it 's supposed to have been

#s60
No

#s61
it

#s65
A growing part

#s67
Uh-huh

#s71
Maybe chop their weenies off
