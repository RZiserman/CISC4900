#s5
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Yes

#s11
I see

#s12
So what do you use for cookbooks

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
uh-huh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
Uh-huh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Right

#s26
Well I I I think we come from from different backgrounds uh

#s27
so the

#s29
I I I

#s30
so it diff- you know

#s31
have different perspectives that you are

#s32
I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on

#s34
because it has almost everything in it

#s35
But on the other hand it 's not very inspiring uh

#s36
it 's a good reference when you need to dig something up

#s38
What we 've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK I think that 's the title by Marion Burroughs

#s40
uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes

#s41
you know the whole meal

#s43
and so she 's

#s45
yeah

#s46
now now I I find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes

#s51
But they 're but they 're but they 're interesting they 're interesting menus um combinations that you would n't have nobody thought of

#s53
Um

#s55
Um gee

#s56
the one I had most recently was was one that was ha- she she describes as Jim Beard 's favorite um summer menu or something

#s57
and it consisted of of grilled kielbasa sausage uh a potato salad with olive oil and uh some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder

#s58
and probably some yogurt was in there

#s62
Uh and that and that was you know that 's that that 's certain you can do in thirty minutes

#s64
But there are a whole lot of you know

#s65
I mean I I would recommend you look at that book if you 're a busy person

#s77
Yes

#s78
yes

#s84
Yes

#s86
Well you had said dinner you know you know

#s87
what would I put together for a formal dinner

#s88
We we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night

#s90
and and um put here here

#s91
the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert you know a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of MUMBLEx cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella um which is this wonderful thing you can do um

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
basically you 're baking baking chicken in a in an open pan um having marinated it first

#s96
and my wife did this part

#s97
so I do n't remember all the details

#s99
marinated in olive oil and some seasoning um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh

#s100
there 's a little bit of brown sugar in there

#s101
and it bakes up

#s102
and it 's a delicious thing

#s103
and it 's easy

#s105
comparatively

#s106
So Um I 'm sorry

#s108
I just love

#s111
but

#s112
Well maybe a little more leisure time to do it

#s113
Yes

#s114
I do n't know

#s118
Yeah

#s119
I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes

#s122
Well there again sometimes it was easy

#s123
they 'd you know

#s124
canned ravioli was one of their favorites

#s125
and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli

#s128
Yes

#s132
Well nice talking to you Cheryl

#s133
Okay

#s135
Bye
