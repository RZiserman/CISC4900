#s1
So how do you feel about it

#s3
Yeah

#s4
I I myself almost uh am in favor of it

#s5
Uh I work at Honeywell

#s6
and I went through a a pretty I do n't know I went through a standard drug testing thing before I I was brought on

#s8
I think that 's pretty standard

#s9
At least at Honeywell it is

#s10
Uh I think it 's important to insure the quality and and uh I do n't know almost the goodness of character You know that kind of thing

#s12
Where do you work

#s14
Oh okay

#s15
Oh okay

#s17
Huh

#s18
Oh great

#s21
Right

#s23
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s26
Yeah

#s27
And that that definitely happens you know

#s28
I mean those the drug tests sure they 're accurate

#s29
but there 's always that margin of error

#s31
And that 's that 's something to be aware of

#s32
Another thing is a lot of times you know they are n't that accurate

#s33
They are n't that sensitive

#s34
Like if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that

#s36
You know I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell

#s37
and uh uh you know I know they did n't catch that

#s38
or else they would have said something

#s39
Uh I 'm sure they screen for just a particular few types

#s40
Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this

#s41
and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for

#s43
Uh I do n't know

#s44
What what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon

#s46
Oh okay

#s47
Great

#s48
Uh yeah

#s49
I 'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida University of Central Florida

#s51
And this is actually a an internship up here

#s52
But uh they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing

#s53
so

#s55
Right

#s57
Uh they essentially

#s58
no

#s59
I sure do n't

#s60
they essentially uh they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that

#s61
So uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests

#s62
and and then they essentially give you the offer

#s64
and then at that point they 'll they 'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that

#s66
So uh there 's some noise on this end

#s67
I 'm actually in a mall calling

#s68
so

#s70
You probably wondered huh

#s71
But

#s75
Yes

#s76
That 's a good question

#s77
I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail I believe they give you one more chance

#s78
They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it

#s80
But uh you know once again those things are not that accurate

#s81
so there 's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know

#s82
But uh wha-

#s83
are you working right now anywhere

#s84
or

#s86
Okay

#s88
Oh okay

#s89
Great

#s90
Yeah

#s91
That was the first time I 'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know Was was going to Honeywell

#s92
A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there

#s94
And he 's doing an internship with I B M

#s96
And uh they basically uh did the same exact thing

#s97
Uh we both got our internships at the same time

#s98
and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time

#s99
So one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process

#s100
But uh

#s102
No

#s103
no

#s104
That 's one thing they do n't do is is drug testing while you 're on the job

#s106
Uh I think I think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it

#s107
but they do n't do it

#s109
You know so That 's good I guess

#s110
I do n't know

#s111
I mean I uh I have gone to a couple of parties since since that time

#s112
and while I do n't do any drugs myself I 've seen some people who work there uh you know smoking a joint or whatever

#s114
And uh you know that 's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know

#s115
But no

#s116
they do n't they do n't really do that

#s117
So

#s120
Yeah
