#s1
Do you think that there 's any way that uh

#s2
or do you think there 's too much crime now

#s3
I mean I guess any crime is too much

#s4
but It 's out of control

#s14
Really

#s16
I would not of okay I would not have guessed that in Seattle

#s19
Yeah

#s20
You know

#s25
Yeah

#s26
I wonder I mean I wonder what what really is the answer

#s27
I mean it seems like our our the prison systems we ca n't seem to decide whether or not it 's a reform system or penal system

#s30
Yeah

#s31
But but the problem is is that we we only have but so much room

#s32
and we we try to put aside in the warehouse

#s33
and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes

#s35
and

#s37
So it 's uh

#s41
I get the feeling that a lot of people have

#s42
I 'm not convinced that I have

#s44
Uh see I mean my mom taught English as a second language

#s45
and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes

#s46
and uh

#s48
Yes

#s50
In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia

#s53
And the problem she had was not with the inmates at all

#s54
The the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison

#s55
I mean It was it was I mean

#s58
they they put her I mean

#s59
I did n't obviously I did n't see the classroom uh and hopefully never will

#s60
but uh they they put her at the end of a hallway

#s61
there were no other classes going on at the time

#s62
and they refused to let her wear a body al- a body alarm Which

#s64
and

#s65
I do n't know exactly what that is

#s66
but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people

#s68
But uh you know MUMBLEx

#s70
No

#s71
she did n't

#s72
She did n't

#s73
she she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates

#s74
and then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse

#s75
and uh she got a couple of inmates that she was n't she did n't feel quite as comfortable around

#s77
But well she had decided that it was when we came back to the States she decided that it was too

#s78
she did n't feel that public schools were s- were safe

#s79
so next thing you know she 's teaching in a maximum security prison

#s82
But uh

#s84
Yeah

#s85
But but the point that was that it you know

#s86
you said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation 's possible

#s87
and and I 'm I 'm thinking that it 's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it

#s89
Uh

#s93
But getting I mean

#s94
well see I always have problems because because I can never decide whether or not I 'm I 'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal

#s97
right

#s98
But I keep I keep thinking that there 's got to be some way that that a lot of this is circumstances

#s100
I mean I ca n't help but wonder if if I grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money would n't would n't I be in prison at this point

#s106
I mean I do n't know

#s108
We 've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs ca n't get onto the program

#s113
I do n't I do n't remember the the gentleman 's name

#s114
but the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a is a Rhodes Scholar

#s115
and what he

#s117
Well what he wants to do is take all the money that uh he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education

#s118
Uh-huh

#s119
And basically just just attack the problem at the demand side

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
Stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent does n't

#s122
I mean Switzerland tried the the grand experiment

#s123
and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park

#s124
and
