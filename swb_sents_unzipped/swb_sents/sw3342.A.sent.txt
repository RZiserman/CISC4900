MUMBLEx not be a very good conversationalist on fishing

#s2
I do n't do a lot of it

#s4
Well good

#s5
maybe I can learn something

#s9
Do you

#s11
Well it is fun what little I do

#s12
Of course I do n't you know

#s13
I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing

#s14
I told my husband last night when I had called and they had told me that this was a topic

#s15
I said well I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm

#s16
He said I do n't think that 's the different kinds of fishing they 're talking about

#s19
That 's about the only kind I know how to do

#s22
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s34
Well it sounds like you do quite a bit of it

#s38
Uh-huh

#s41
Do you have a boat

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s50
I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas

#s51
The ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock

#s53
but unless you have a boat you ca n't really get into the where they call the good fishing holes you know

#s56
Is it

#s58
Uh-huh

#s59
My in-laws live on a lake uh a little bit east of Dallas kind of in the Piney Woods

#s60
and the lake is beautiful

#s61
and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish

#s62
but actually catching fish to eat per se you do n't really do much of that right there

#s63
I catch a lot of little old uh I think they call them perch

#s65
and then the the uh turtles try to eat up all my bait

#s67
So it 's it 's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit

#s69
but it 's kind of fun

#s71
Um I would be afraid of that

#s73
Do they ever get on your hook

#s77
Uh-huh

#s79
Are they poisonous snakes

#s83
Uh-huh

#s86
Yeah

#s87
I think I 'd be a little bit afraid of those

#s90
Uh-huh

#s91
We uh saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws ' place last year

#s92
It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know

#s93
Great big snake

#s94
and it of course it scared the women to death you know

#s95
but the men come out and said oh well that 's only a a king snake

#s96
it wo n't really hurt you you know

#s97
But it looked so bad

#s99
and it was so big that it might not would have hurt us but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there you know

#s101
But they 're scary looking

#s103
Yes uh

#s104
I think that uh probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else

#s107
Uh-huh

#s109
Now they have a lot of bass tournaments

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
Oh no

#s116
Uh-huh

#s117
Well that 's kind of

#s118
we 've never entered a tournament or anything

#s119
We 're not that big into fishing

#s120
but I see a lot of people you know

#s121
early in the morning there 'll be all the boats going out

#s122
and they 'll say Well there 's a big bass tournament this weekend

#s123
and all those people are here for the tournament you know

#s125
So I think there 's a lot of people that have you know really

#s126
I guess that you 'd call it really sport fishing

#s127
they 're really into it to try to win

#s130
My

#s132
But it is it 's very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around

#s133
The peace and calmness is really relaxing

#s136
Uh-huh

#s138
I 've never tried taking a book with me

#s139
I 'll have to try that one of these days
