Well I I feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that I think there are some occupations that they should such as the health field the transportation field uh

#s3
they 're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth

#s4
uh they do it to prisoners

#s6
so I I uh I I I feel like it should be mandatory in some professions

#s7
and I think if if uh an employer feels that he wants to to drug test employees and they do n't like it then they should not be employed there

#s8
That was

#s9
you know I would not mind it

#s12
Right

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
unless an employer has a reason to believe that his uh the work competency of of the employ- employee is is hurting the business

#s23
I mean maybe it 's uh

#s25
Number one because generally if if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft

#s27
and as an employer I would think that would be

#s28
and the first

#s29
it 's not going to be wholesale because of the cost

#s31
There 's no way

#s32
But but my concern is uh school bus drivers

#s36
Um I 'm not even

#s37
I 'm in education

#s38
I 'm not even opposed to it for that

#s39
Uh I 'm concerned in the medical field

#s41
I I I think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because I consider that a drug

#s45
Right

#s46
Right

#s47
Right

#s49
But when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or a train um

#s52
and it does n't take that long

#s53
They do n't have to be totally roaring drunk

#s55
just a little off on their timing could could mean life

#s60
Oh okay

#s62
Uh-huh

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
uh-huh

#s68
Oh my word

#s70
Control

#s73
Right

#s74
Well as long as you accept that it is a random a random testing uh you know to to alleviate

#s76
that way you ca n't feel like somebody 's out to get me

#s78
If

#s79
it 's almost like being selected for jury duty

#s81
You know so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel

#s82
that 's that 's just the way it is

#s84
I would I would rather have it that way to know that I was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because I I think there 's when you let other employees turn in people

#s87
Right

#s89
Right

#s90
So I I I would really rather know however

#s91
there 's got to be some backup to say that

#s92
if if somebody does observe you at say at a party uh using drugs I would think that it would be their obligation to report that

#s96
Personnel or something

#s97
Right

#s99
Right

#s100
Right

#s101
I do n't know what kind of work you do

#s102
but there there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way

#s108
Right

#s110
Right

#s111
Right

#s113
It 's it 's

#s114
I I just think employers have to have especially given today the drug abuse that goes on I just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they 're not being put at risk Because they 're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits the insurance claims et cetera

#s117
and and I 'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims are n't due to uh illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse

#s119
Right

#s121
Right

#s126
Uh

#s128
Uh-huh

#s129
uh-huh

#s132
Huh

#s134
To see how that 's

#s135
Is it is it uh just a small group of the employees that are concerned

#s138
They they just do n't want to be drug tested

#s141
You know we 've never my husband and I have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested

#s143
Uh my husband 's retired from I R S agents

#s145
However this is n't a problem that we have either alcohol or drug

#s147
and so we we in our minds we 're thinking what 's the big deal

#s155
Right

#s156
And and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then they 're going to take some other right away from you

#s157
but I I firm-

#s159
I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything

#s160
and of course the big deal one of the big deals now too is to that when you come into a company as you sign a paper saying that I will go take a
