#s2
Certainly

#s4
Um

#s7
Well I I tend to uh take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that

#s10
Oh well I could n't live without the family vacations

#s11
but uh my favorite is the the indulgent ones where we go off and and uh see places that have interested me since I was a kid for the most part

#s13
And uh

#s15
Uh not anymore

#s16
They uh they 've been in San Diego for the last few years

#s17
and they 're moving to Florida

#s19
And that 's one of those things

#s20
you just have to go once a year

#s23
So uh basically it it sorts out into that

#s24
and then once about once every three or four years I try to get over to England because I lived there for a while some years back

#s27
Oh

#s29
Beautiful country

#s30
Beautiful country

#s32
beautiful people

#s35
But uh

#s36
and I 'd real really like to go because um I 'm fairly recently married

#s38
and and my husband has been hearing about these people for years

#s39
and uh but he 's never met them

#s40
so uh I 'd like I 'd like to do that

#s41
But anyway that 's that 's our typical vacation

#s42
and uh we enjoy the family vacations

#s43
but the other ones are very special getaways

#s44
and we probably take one of each every year

#s45
How about yourself

#s50
Oh I 've never been on a cruise

#s53
Uh-huh

#s56
Yeah

#s60
Um

#s63
Well what do you do on a cruise

#s64
I 've never been on a cruise

#s74
Huh

#s77
Uh-huh

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
And where have you been on these cruises

#s85
I see

#s87
Oh the the Mexican coast

#s89
That 's all Mexico I think

#s97
Where are you from originally

#s99
Uh-huh

#s103
Uh-huh

#s106
Oh yes

#s111
Well I I grew up in Dallas

#s112
so I mean it 's not it 's not like I 'm going home

#s114
My my parents retired first to San Diego

#s116
and they 're going now to Florida

#s117
and so they 're going very nice places

#s118
thank God

#s120
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know

#s121
I really came to love San Diego and feel very comfortable there

#s122
They 've been there eight years

#s124
And uh you know I just grab the car and drive everywhere

#s126
So it it is it is nice

#s127
but it 's not home

#s128
This is home

#s129
and um and I 've never thought about a cruise

#s130
It 's so funny

#s135
Uh-huh

#s139
Uh-huh

#s141
What 's the best part from your point of view

#s143
Uh-huh

#s148
Oh that will be nice

#s150
Oh sure

#s152
Sure

#s153
Well go in do n't go in the winter

#s157
Oh

#s159
Well th- there are exceptions made for special occasions like that

#s161
But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer

#s162
so

#s165
Huh Well that sounds wonderful

#s166
I I guess I I would contemplate going on a cruise uh oh all circumstances permitting it

#s170
Uh-huh

#s175
Huh

#s176
How long are the cruises

#s178
Uh-huh

#s183
Yeah

#s188
Yeah

#s189
Uh I tend

#s190
when when I spend enough money to go overseas I go for a long time

#s195
Oh that 's interesting

#s197
Uh-huh

#s199
Oh

#s201
Uh-huh

#s209
Huh

#s213
That 's really nice

#s216
Uh-huh

#s220
Huh Well may maybe now things are calming down again That will happen

#s223
Well that that 's really great

#s224
Uh

#s226
I I mean as I said basically all I 've done is go back and forth to parents

#s227
and uh

#s230
And and uh we had my husband had a conference in L A

#s231
so we spent a week in L A

#s232
