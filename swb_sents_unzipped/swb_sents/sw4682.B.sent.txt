Recently

#s3
I ca n't really say recently

#s4
But I think about uh about a year ago uh I bought a product from some company down at uh in Atlanta Georgia

#s5
I believe it was one of these uh one of these uh mixers These like these juice machines

#s6
and uh the uh the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay

#s8
but I found that uh it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh after

#s10
even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about uh three weeks of use

#s11
And I do n't think it was my fault because I you know I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it

#s12
but uh it was really uh it was

#s13
I had to send it back after like you know the third week because I realized it was like it was not

#s14
something was very very wrong with the blade

#s15
Uh what about you

#s17
Uh-huh

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s43
Right

#s48
Uh-huh

#s52
Uh-huh

#s64
Well at least you 're talking to somebody who counts

#s68
Uh-huh

#s69
Right

#s73
Right

#s74
right

#s77
I find

#s78
up here in the northeast we have uh well w- we have these mail order companies like L L Bean

#s79
and uh they are famous for I guess having really top-notch service

#s80
They 've got uh

#s82
I mean I 've I 've I I have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally

#s83
I 've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition

#s84
and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you do n't want it anymore

#s85
Uh they 'll they 'll actually do things like this

#s86
I mean they 're really they they go- bend over backwards service wise for you

#s87
I 've uh I 've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call

#s89
I guess if if you call the e- any eight hundred number uh if you you can call up e- any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get uh the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies

#s90
And um actually I 've tried that with a few companies lately

#s91
And they 've most of them have been pretty good

#s92
but I I was

#s93
one reason why I like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through Bean or though

#s94
uh I guess Bean 's one of Bean 's big competitors is Land 's End out in uh I guess it 's Wisconsin somewhere

#s95
They they are uh they 're very good about uh insur-

#s97
like the customer is always right

#s98
and you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding

#s99
and uh they usually get you know they they make things are they ma- make sure things are set properly if you 're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise

#s102
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s106
Well I think I guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is I guess

#s107
there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are uh you know

#s108
things are getting rough out there

#s109
there 's a lot of you know

#s110
the morale among employees tends to go down

#s111
and that in turn like you know
