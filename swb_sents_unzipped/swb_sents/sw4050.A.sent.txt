Well I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago

#s91
and there were

#s92
we sent out five hundred uh announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there

#s93
And so that was a real challenge

#s94
and I was president of our family reunion for two years

#s95
and I was n't very MUMBLEx at that duty for two years in a row

#s96
but I found that advance planning was the key to success

#s99
Uh-huh

#s102
Oh that 's wonderful though

#s105
Oh

#s107
Oh well that is that is helpful

#s108
