#s2
Sure

#s3
I have a Springer Spaniel

#s4
and her name is Thumper

#s5
She 's about seven or eight years old

#s6
I got her for Christmas from my family and uh back when we lived in Nebraska

#s7
I like to hunt

#s8
and uh so I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that boy I could just go out and get all kinds of game

#s10
Yeah

#s11
except we live in Plano Texas now

#s14
so

#s21
Do you have a pet now

#s26
Oh

#s29
What kind of cat is it

#s33
Uh-huh

#s37
Being born outside you did n't have any problems house training him

#s40
That 's good

#s50
Sure

#s51
And older

#s53
Well we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town

#s54
and uh we thought that

#s55
we have a cat now

#s56
but we thought Well if we ever get another cat you know we 'd want something kind of unique

#s57
so we kind of looked around

#s58
and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats

#s59
and we sort of fell in love with the uh Maine Coon cats

#s62
They 're huge

#s68
Oh

#s70
I 'll be darned

#s71
I did n't know that

#s76
Well that 's interesting

#s78
We kind of like

#s79
well my family did n't necessarily like like them as much as I did

#s80
but the Manx is that the one that does n't have a tail

#s82
it sort of has a bob tail

#s83
I kind of like that too

#s84
but

#s90
Well I 'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog

#s91
and then I suppose our five minutes will be up

#s94
I work for a university

#s95
and I went to uh Omaha Nebraska to recruit students

#s96
and I had some time off in the afternoon

#s97
so I went to a a pet shop

#s98
and I saw these little Springer Spaniels

#s100
and so I decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have

#s101
so when I got back home to Carney Nebraska I told my wife about it

#s102
and I said You know this is just a

#s103
I I I can just hear the dog crying for me now

#s105
And Christmas is coming up hint hint

#s106
and so I had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university

#s107
and one of the people uh that we went with uh they were friends of ours

#s108
and so we got to Omaha

#s109
and I decided I 'd take my friend over and show him the dog

#s110
and so I got over there

#s111
and she said Oh that 's too bad

#s112
the dog has already been sold

#s113
And I did n't realize it

#s114
but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog

#s115
and she was in the back room

#s116
and so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students

#s117
and and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room

#s118
and and I had no idea

#s119
And so we headed back to Carney that night

#s120
and the dog rode in the car

#s121
and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat

#s122
and they left the dog in the car

#s123
and I guess while we were inside eating Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car

#s124
and uh finally we made it back to uh to Carney

#s125
and
