#s1
Uh anyway we 're supposed to talk about recycling

#s2
Basically what what your personal opinion is on it

#s3
Uh this is this is really for a speech research project they 're doing

#s4
so uh I do n't know

#s5
Florida is pretty good about recycling is n't it

#s7
Oh they did

#s10
Uh-huh

#s11
Yeah

#s13
Not quite

#s14
no

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s20
Okay

#s21
Okay

#s23
Yeah

#s24
Okay

#s26
Oh that 's that 's good

#s27
Let me ask you this

#s28
Do they require you to presort it

#s30
Okay

#s31
See that 's something in Minneapolis they 're really strict on

#s32
In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly

#s33
But when I lived in Orlando it 's like you could put almost anything in there

#s35
and they 'd just sort it out for you

#s38
It was really pretty good if you 're lazy like I am

#s39
so

#s49
Oh okay

#s50
yeah

#s57
Yeah

#s59
Right

#s61
Uh-huh

#s63
It can

#s64
yeah

#s68
Right

#s71
Yeah

#s72
you got to tie them up and everything

#s76
Right

#s78
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s86
Exactly

#s87
It is you know a big hassle

#s90
Yeah

#s91
that 's true

#s92
I mean up here they give you one one of those containers

#s93
and you put everything in it

#s95
So it 's like if if you use a lot of stuff you

#s96
it 's like well you know if you 're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it 's going to be hard pressed to p- to put all your recyclables in that one place you know

#s99
So it 's kind of a pain in the butt

#s101
But uh I do n't know

#s102
That 's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know

#s103
You have have those garbage people that make how every many make tw- twenty thirty bucks an hour

#s104
have them do a little bit of the sorting You know And and maybe come up with a better system

#s106
Make it a little more convenient

#s107
But

#s110
Yeah

#s113
Oh you can actually rent those

#s115
Okay

#s116
That 's interesting

#s117
Yeah

#s119
up here the the city provides them

#s120
Kind of like

#s123
Oh okay MUMBLEx

#s125
So where exactly are you in terms of of like Sarasota

#s126
Are you north of Sarasota or East

#s128

#s130
And Sarasota is on the west coast

#s132
Okay

#s133
Like south of Tampa right

#s135
Okay

#s136

#s140
