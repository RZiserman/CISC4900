Hello Chuck

#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh I did n't think that was a new revelation

#s10
Right

#s11
So what what is the E P A recommending now

#s14
Uh-huh

#s18
Yeah

#s22
Right

#s23
That 's a that 's a common problem though

#s24
That it seems that has happened in Dallas as well as New York

#s25
and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house

#s26
and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I could n't recycle it anymore which is n't good for business on the other end either I suppose

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Right

#s34
Well that 's good

#s36
Right

#s37
There has to be uh a reuse for it

#s38
I mean that 's why they recycle

#s39
The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers Uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet

#s41
and uh I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days

#s42
and they 're making clothes now that are recycled

#s43
Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that

#s49
Uh-huh

#s52
Oh really

#s55
Right

#s58
Huh

#s60
Well it 's carbon

#s61
so that makes sense

#s62
like a carbon fuel of some sort

#s63
but what what about emissions

#s68
Oh

#s70
Okay

#s73
No

#s74
Well it 's interesting

#s75
I bet that was a good day at the yeah conference then

#s78
Did it change anything for you
