Well uh I am a student

#s3
and I have uh been actually watching more movies on video than being able to go out to see uh movies at the store or at the theater

#s5
Uh I st- I want to see the FISHER KING and and uh catch ROBIN HOOD

#s9
Uh let 's see

#s10
Uh I 'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on

#s11
Uh WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated over hyped um recently

#s12
Well you 're catching me at it uh uh at mind 's end here

#s13
What have you seen recently

#s15
Yes

#s17
Yes

#s19
Enjoyed that quite a bit

#s20
Um I thought the uh the cima- the cinematography was excellent

#s22
Uh the story was

#s23
uh though it tended to be a little one sided uh it was good

#s25
Uh it was it was believable

#s28
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s34
Wow

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
They knew they knew the extras or the

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
Scope

#s54
Uh-huh

#s58
It it was

#s59
but it 's a side that has n't been told Uh as far as you know telling it from you know the Indians as the good guys and the the white men as the bad guys

#s60
I I really thought about uh all the the westerns we have seen for years and years

#s62
and it 's just shoot the Indians

#s63
and they are always the savages

#s65
So

#s68
Uh-huh

#s71
Yes

#s73
Yeah

#s74
That was that was a good movie

#s75
Um it was just kind of a get away movie

#s77
Kind of

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
Right

#s84
Yes

#s85
You 're bringing it

#s86
I do n't know

#s87
I had a I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I 've seen

#s88
But yeah

#s89
I 've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES

#s90
and uh

#s93
Oh definitely

#s95
Yes

#s99
I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago

#s100
and they showed all five in a row

#s102
Oh they had it everywhere

#s103
uh every major city had one theater that did it

#s104
and

#s107
Right

#s108
and they did it in Houston

#s109
they did it well they did it everywhere

#s110
And it was it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed

#s111
and the thing that I did n't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row uh time wise they happen one after another and just no no time between them

#s113
but you can watch the characters develop
