So have you done any painting projects lately

#s4
Oh really

#s6
What kind of painting was it

#s11
Uh-huh

#s12
it was it

#s17
Yeah

#s19
Oh uh-huh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s25
Oh well what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends

#s33
Uh-huh

#s35
So you ca n't use oil on wood

#s43
Oh so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway

#s48
Oh

#s52
Oh is is that what you usually use in the house is latex

#s55
Um

#s59
Uh-huh

#s60
yeah

#s61
I heard about that

#s62
I guess a friend of mine had a uh well

#s63
she she just started up a day care center

#s64
and uh the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff

#s66
so uh she had that done

#s67
But uh

#s69
Well um so to speak I had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some um farm equipment in

#s72
and um what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer

#s73
and uh I had this big five gallon jug

#s74
and it was like paint thinner

#s75
I mean I you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner

#s77
but uh you just took a roller and put it on there

#s78
and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed

#s79
So

#s81
Yeah

#s82
it was

#s83
it used all of it

#s84
I guess it was about three hundred yards worth

#s85
So Well I guess it worked out

#s86
It was pretty easy actually

#s92
Well what about the trim in your house

#s93
Did you have to do that

#s99
Uh-huh

#s106
Uh-huh

#s108
Oh yeah

#s111
Did you have uh one coat or two

#s113
Uh-huh

#s118
Yeah

#s119
that would be really time uh a time saver

#s128
Uh-huh

#s130
Oh me I would have had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges

#s131
and and then I 'd have probably rolled it on

#s132
I 'd it would have taken me forever

#s136
Yeah

#s137
well the first time it 'd probably would have taken me forever

#s138
so

#s145
Well how long did it take you all

#s148
Uh-huh

#s150
So there was two of you all

#s154
Well that 's easy enough

#s156
Um

#s158
I think I could probably do it uh

#s159
as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then I could do it

#s167
Uh-huh
