Budgeting activity in our household I has is uh uh kind of an informal kind of situation

#s2
We we you know put

#s3
actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited

#s4
I do n't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore

#s5
It just gets deposited

#s6
And and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in

#s7
and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them You see

#s8
and so our our budgeting

#s9
w- we really do n't have a formal budgeting situation

#s10
Every time I 've ever tried one it 's uh I 've just got wrapped in my inertia

#s11
And uh I 've just decided not to pursue it

#s12
Uh what what 's your budget situation

#s19
You know well a- a- actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets Is n't it

#s28
Uh-huh

#s35
Well my you know my my parents too

#s36
You you you were born in in the in the late thirties or early forties

#s41
Yeah

#s46
Um

#s49
Uh-huh

#s50
Well that that 's good

#s54
Well we we buy what

#s55
well we just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher

#s57
And and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge Along with my trip to Japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars

#s59
and you know

#s61
Right

#s62
I mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in

#s63
But but we also have zero in- interest being paid

#s64
And we pay it off as as it goes

#s67
Yeah

#s68
So we never really get that much over uh over extended

#s71
Huh

#s73
Yeah

#s74
We 're we 're doing that

#s75
We have you know uh

#s76
th- this is our our our big uh

#s77
we did redecorating

#s78
Two you know two new pieces in the ref- in the family room and new carpet

#s79
I mean we just uh we 've just been spending spending spending

#s83
Bu- but we have n't really done anything for a long time because we 've we 've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year

#s85
So we 're you know we do n't have that

#s87
Yeah

#s88
it 's uh it 's about time that we did that

#s89
But th- the the terrible part about it I 've looked at it all

#s90
and it all looks still pretty good to me

#s91
Why why we need to replace it

#s92
But but un- unfortunately my my my wife really feels as though it 's it 's just been an inappropriate uh thing to to

#s93
I mean that rug is thirteen years old

#s94
why not replace it

#s95
I mean uh I say it might go for another thirteen

#s96
but uh too late

#s97
we 'll never find that out

#s101
And

#s103
You know I I I do n't spend that much money

#s104
I just uh we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know

#s105
we sort of take care of the kids when they were school

#s106
and they they got through school

#s107
And that was the major you know decade of expenses you know

#s108
So we we feel as uh

#s109
but as far as any formal budgeting uh you know I I we just apparently have been very fortunate

#s110
When we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat

#s111
We never really you know have to program money for that or make choices you know

#s112
But uh we do n't have that uproarious a a lifestyle

#s113
After all we 're
