#s1
So how do you uh

#s2
so so it sounds like you 've got a television going on there

#s3
so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news

#s4
Is that

#s6
Really

#s7
Wow

#s8


#
Uh what what station do you listen to

#s13
Cliff

#s14
I see

#s15
so uh it 's not affiliated with anything is it

#s16
Not it 's not a network station

#s19
Okay

#s20
yeah

#s21
because I I listen to uh public radio a lot

#s22
and they have they have K C R W which I I I saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet I guess

#s23
They 're getting a little getting a little feisty now

#s25
Uh

#s29
Yeah

#s30
so you have a paper or something or

#s33
Uh-huh

#s35
Yeah

#s36
How do you like it

#s37
It 's been it 's been a while since I read the Dallas news

#s38
I uh fact last time I read the Dallas Dallas news I was in Arkansas

#s39
I uh

#s41
Oh yeah

#s43
Well that must be pretty bad

#s44
So how did that happen anyway

#s46
No

#s47
not how

#s48
I mean when did it when did they

#s50
Yeah

#s52
Oh really

#s53
Um

#s55
Oh me I uh good grief I read the TIMES LOS ANGELES TIMES

#s56
There 's quite a task if you 've ever run into one

#s57
They 're uh speci-

#s59
Yeah

#s60
they 're thick

#s61
Uh if there 's something you want to know it 's it 's in the TIMES and then and in detail

#s62
Uh they uh we we used to have two papers here in town

#s63
and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of oh I do n't know just nobody was buying it really

#s65
Yeah

#s66
pretty much

#s67
Uh there used to be fact I think there still is the uh the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley

#s68
and uh they 're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes

#s69
In fact it was kind of weird because I met the uh I met the I met the editor uh while I was on uh while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time

#s70
It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff

#s71
He was a really cool guy Uh you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff

#s72
And uh it 's it 's a pretty good paper

#s73
but uh you know it 's not it 's not the TIMES

#s75
Although I you know I 'm sorry to see some of their uh

#s76
there 's there 's a daily news uh news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they 're they 're expanding I guess

#s77
But uh a- and occasionally I I pick up like TIME magazine or something I think uh if they 've got an interesting lead story

#s78
but you know it 's

#s79
I I do n't have time

#s82
Yeah

#s83
that 's that 's kind of a problem for them

#s84
There 's a lot of people who fall into that category

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
I see

#s88
Yeah

#s89
the big dailies do n't like to do n't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf

#s90
I have to admit the TIMES is kind of provincial too

#s91
It 's basically anything that 's south of downtown they do n't bother to cover

#s93
Uh-huh

#s96
Yeah

#s97
I know

#s98
I uh it was it was a big discovery when when the TIMES when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County

#s99
I mean the way they I mean the way they 've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border

#s104
Oh really

#s105
Yeah

#s106
yeah

#s107
I I I find that attitude kind of arrogant though

#s108
It 's like you 're taking our money but you 're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us
