#s4
Oh sure

#s5
Uh well I uh went to school at Madison for two years

#s6
and they are really big on women 's rights And and equal treatment

#s9
And so I I 've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that

#s10
But uh I 'm not that liberated

#s11
I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned you know

#s13
So I you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff

#s14
But uh I think it 's I think it 's interesting and better for women to see that there 's more more of them doing men 's fields

#s15
I like to see that

#s16
And I do n't like to see women you know like waiting on men hand and foot

#s18
but you know I I believe in like sharing and doing things for each other

#s24
Uh-huh

#s26
Right

#s29
Oh me too

#s30
I hope that happens to me someday

#s31
I mean I I do n't mind doing stuff

#s33
Uh I have a boyfriend

#s34
and I got to make him dinner and stuff

#s35
but you know I he 'll help me do the dishes

#s36
I do n't want to you know expect to help to clean up then after

#s38
Yeah

#s41
Yeah

#s42
So

#s46
Right

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Right

#s54
Uh-huh

#s57

Uh-huh

#s71
Oh me too

#s76
Yeah

#s77
I like to see that

#s78
I think it 's uh really neat to see and all that educated minority uh person who really knows what they 're talking about

#s80
And it 's just too bad that some people you know still look down on them just because of their color You know

#s83
Especially black women

#s85
So

#s88
Right

#s90

#s104

#s108
Same here

#s111
Uh-huh

#s113
Yeah

#s115
Yeah

#s116
Exactly

#s117
I I see more men uh like participating in like the family things with children Like you know helping to take care of them more And and uh uh doing the jobs equally you know

#s122
Oh

#s124
I 'm not that big on politics

#s125
I 'm not that educated on it

#s127
I 'm

#s130
Oh yeah

#s131
I agree with that

#s137
Oh I do n't know

#s139
Yeah

#s140
I know who you 're talking about

#s144
