#s3
All right

#s4
Well I 'm uh I 'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling I 'm afraid

#s5
We um recently moved here from North Carolina

#s6
and they had curbside recycling

#s7
and it was very easy to you know to put everything out there

#s8
but we do n't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now

#s10
and uh so I 've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where take things where they belong

#s12
Well we 've been here since January

#s13
so we we still feel very new

#s15
but uh it 's working up to a year now

#s17
so I guess we 're old timers compared to some people

#s21
Right

#s22
Yeah

#s25
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s29
Well where do you take those things

#s32
Uh-huh

#s34
Well where do you do that

#s35
because we 've been saving cans for my daughter 's choir um

#s37
but I did n't know where to take them

#s43
Oh

#s45
Yeah

#s47
Better than nothing

#s48
right

#s51
Yeah

#s52
I

#s53
it seems like ever since we 've moved here we 've been hearing that you know it 's coming in a couple of months

#s56
but

#s59
Oh

#s60
Right

#s64
Yeah

#s65
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off

#s66
but

#s68
Well they yeah they they 're a lot of bulk anyway

#s70
yeah

#s73
Right

#s76
Yeah

#s77
it was real easy with the bins

#s78
it really was

#s79
it was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage

#s80
so um

#s83
Right

#s87
Yeah

#s88
Well how much do you earn on the cans

#s89
I I did n't know ho- what kind of an idea to give her for

#s91
Uh-huh

#s94
Yeah

#s95
So it 's gone down

#s97
Yeah

#s100
Right

#s101
Yeah

#s104
Uh-huh

#s107
Yeah

#s109
Well that sounds like a pretty good project

#s114
Oh

#s116
Well I 'll have to keep myself and and ge- get on it

#s117
My neighbor across the street um is so careful about recycling

#s118
and so I keep telling myself I 'll I 'll get it organized

#s119
but may maybe they 'll beat me and and do the city wide first

#s123
Right

#s124
right

#s125
I wo n't have any excuse then

#s126
that 's for sure

#s128
Thinking about it anyway

#s130
Yeah

#s131
but Well um have you

#s133
do they time this thing for us

#s134
or do we

#s140
You ca n't chat all day huh

#s142
Okay

#s145
Okay

#s147
Bye-bye
