#s2
Well really the only things that I have returned have not been faulty

#s3
it 's been because of the size or some problem like that

#s5
I really have n't had to return things because they did n't perform the way they were supposed to

#s13
Uh-huh

#s14
What age are your children

#s16
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s25
Well my daughter is twenty-one now

#s26
so it 's been a while since we 've had Barbie things

#s28
But we did have Barbies we did have Barbies and things

#s29
and there

#s30
seems to me that that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade

#s32
So she was n't in it for very long before she was out of it

#s33
but uh I do n't remember her breaking a lot of stuff

#s35
No

#s36
I do n't

#s37
But I also do n't remember lots of little pieces

#s38
They 've got so many different things with it now

#s43
Goodness

#s47
Oh dear

#s50
Well uh I guess if they 'll replace them then they assume they should n't have broken

#s54
Any direction

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
Right

#s58
Yeah

#s59
The main thing that they 've they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes

#s61
You know that was about it

#s63
Uh-huh

#s66
And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics

#s67
My my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and twenty-eight

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70
and

#s72
No

#s73
not really

#s74
We uh have n't had that much you know problem with things that we have bought

#s75
They seem to to last

#s76
In fact when they offer us extended warranties we we do n't buy them because we 've We don- we find we do n't need them

#s79
And uh it seems like it 's just a an added tack on

#s80
Plus a lot of the credit cards now you know will guarantee

#s81
if you purchase on your credit card you know then they put an extended warranty on it if it does n't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time

#s84
so it seems like it 's a waste of money

#s89
Uh-huh

#s90
And like I 've even bought on a recliner once I bought you know a a an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that

#s91
and I never used it

#s93
And so it seems ridiculous

#s94
And like washers and dryers and things like that I 've never had one go out

#s95
In fact they usually

#s96
when they do go out it 's either something my husband can buy the part and fix

#s97
and we do n't even have a repairman come

#s98
or it means it 's old enough that it 's time to replace the whole thing

#s100
Uh-huh

#s102
So I mean

#s104
I do too

#s110
Uh-huh

#s111
And they charge you a pretty good price for them too

#s116
Uh-huh

#s118
Well my husband finally just put his foot down

#s120
and he said we 're not going to buy any of these anymore

#s121
and if it goes out well you know

#s123
Uh-huh

#s124
and uh so we really have been fairly happy wi- with things

#s125
but now we take good care of things

#s126
and we do n't uh run out and buy a lot of of things either

#s127
And since our kids are n't little anymore I 'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken

#s132
Well you look at the consumer guide

#s134
And uh you go around

#s135
and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
