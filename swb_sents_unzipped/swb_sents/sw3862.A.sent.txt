Hello

#s3
Hi

#s4
my name is Dolphene

#s5
I live in Texas

#s9
Okay

#s10
I work for T I

#s11
do do you also

#s13
Okay

#s17
Oh okay

#s18
uh you ready to begin

#s20
Oh okay

#s21
Okay

#s23
Yes

#s25
Well I do n't think that uh any of my relatives would really like to go there

#s26
I I believe if I am in a position uh like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also and uh or have someone go into their home you know and uh and look after them

#s28
That way

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
Right

#s33
it 's basically it 's more how they feel about it

#s35
And it is like they feel they are uh the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away You know

#s38
Right

#s39
Uh-huh

#s42
Uh-huh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s45
And another thing to think about uh on the positive side of the nursing homes here

#s46
I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home

#s48
and I got to see a lot of the things that they did

#s50
they uh they had a lot of crafts

#s52
and they had a lot of games

#s53
and uh they get together and just do

#s54
they they do all sorts of things

#s55
and then there

#s56
some some of the uh the people that are in there are real you know very nice and friendly to everybody

#s58
and uh then there are others that are

#s59
uh it is just a job

#s60
and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home

#s63
Uh the the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important

#s66
Right

#s67
Right

#s70
Yeah

#s72
Yeah

#s74
Well it is like the one that I worked in uh you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day

#s75
they would just roll themselves around all over the place

#s76
and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities

#s78
and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group

#s79
and they they just did n't like participate together with the others because they had some some uh I guess uh slight mental disabilities and things like that

#s83
What what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that

#s87
and they do n't do n't uh they were n't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities
