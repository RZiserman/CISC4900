#s2
Okay

#s3
I guess we 're ready to start

#s4
Well I guess

#s5
what part of what part of the country do you live in

#s7
Oh okay

#s9
Well I 'm also in Dallas

#s11
The reason that I ask is the two conversations I 've had have been out of state

#s13
But uh have you always lived here in Dallas

#s14
and

#s17
I see

#s21
Oh well you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood

#s24
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow

#s29
Yeah

#s31
Well that 's good

#s32
I I have lived in Texas essentially all my life

#s34
Around in Texas

#s35
and uh I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it

#s37
But uh I do n't know

#s38
I 'm not sure I would want to take on those winters

#s39
I 'm getting older and uh not sure that 's something I want to do

#s41
I live uh over in the Lake Highlands area if you 're familiar with that

#s43
Okay

#s45
Uh you

#s47
This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia Skillman cross

#s50
We 're just north of uh White Rock Lake

#s55
Well we have some very nice hou- homes here in this area

#s56
Uh my particular

#s57
I guess they want us to describe the area

#s58
so uh my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million

#s60
Yes

#s61
uh the homes that were here earlier were smaller

#s62
Now they 've gotten larger and larger as as they have developed the land

#s63
And of course it 's pretty static right now

#s64
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy

#s67
How about you

#s70
Okay

#s71
Okay

#s74
Uh-huh

#s77
Okay

#s79
Yes

#s80
those are over a million

#s85
Well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas

#s87
Not as bad as Houston

#s88
but exactly what you 're describing is what happens all over

#s92
Well now do you live in a a home or zero lot home

#s94
or

#s100
Okay

#s104
Oh

#s106
Well your was your house in good shape

#s107
was it damaged

#s111
Oh it was

#s114
Oh

#s116
I see

#s125
Yes

#s126
I am familiar with that

#s129
I where I live is a house that 's seventeen years old when I bought it

#s130
And we bought it from someone who was in it

#s131
but before they had it I found out after I had been in the house it it had sat empty for the better part of a year

#s133
And I 'm not sure what happened

#s134
but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for for about four years

#s136
I I I found a lot of things

#s137
but
