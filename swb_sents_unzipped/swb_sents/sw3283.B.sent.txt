Right

#s5
I am very much for capital punishment

#s8
My Dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus

#s10
And I 've been raised around prison prisons all my life

#s13
And I believe if you do n't have a punishment befitting the crime there 's not any deterrent

#s17
That 's right

#s20
Especially not a federal prison

#s29
Well see we were under uh the state 's prisons were under a mandate to uh

#s30
it was over crowded

#s31
and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go

#s34
And finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose Under early bail you know or early uh out

#s40
But uh we have

#s41
the death penalty is not given often

#s43
But there have been

#s45
And you know I

#s46
maybe it should be uh well it should be given you know I I wo n't say sparingly

#s47
but I do believe it should be befitting the crime

#s52
Right

#s53
Of course you know they 're they 're entitled to a speedy trial

#s55
But then they 're they 're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals

#s58
So somehow you know it does n't really balance out too much

#s64
And it seems even though you know that they got

#s65
the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey I 'm tired

#s66
I just want out

#s68
You know I 'm tired of fighting it

#s70
Then the system just keeps on

#s75
And at that point you know I I really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process

#s80
Well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system

#s87
Uh it does n't it does n't help them any at all

#s90
and of course your court system when you get into the appeals

#s91
I do n't believe criminal is in a court by itself

#s92
And the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that should n't be in there

#s97
We 've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life

#s101
Well I just

#s105
I just feel like their crime and punishment

#s106
and if if you do n't have the punishment you double your crime

#s107
And the you know that is just personal feeling

#s108
It 's not going on facts

#s109
I think the facts would probably back it up

#s112
but

#s113
What

#s115
Well yes

#s116
I
