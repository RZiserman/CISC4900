#s3
Well I 'm in a I 'm in an urban area

#s4
I 'm in Dallas

#s6
And we 're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem

#s7
Uh in Dallas some of the major problems uh

#s8
drugs seems to be re- related to quite a bit of the crime we have now

#s9
There is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs

#s11
And uh I think that 's a national problem though

#s13
It 's not unique

#s15
Yes

#s16
Uh-huh

#s17
Well now we 're pretty close to the golden triangle are n't you

#s21
Right

#s22
research triangle and all of that

#s24
And uh I 'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers

#s25
so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate

#s26
but in all your cities now it seems like th- there is a a crowd that 's really effected by this bill

#s30
Really

#s37
Really

#s39
Um Well here uh I 'm not sure how many Dallas has had

#s40
I 've uh

#s41
Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four

#s42
I I do n't know

#s43
A a number every week

#s45
Uh Dallas is having quite a few

#s46
Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like I say drug related

#s47
Uh I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values

#s48
Seems like a a lot of people do n't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to

#s50
Uh I

#s54
The economy is lousy

#s56
Uh-huh

#s67
Boy that really that really takes someone who is bold to do that

#s70
Well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home

#s72
Uh-huh

#s75
Well that

#s78
I see

#s84
Yeah

#s86
Well I think you hit on one point there is you know each other

#s88
I 'm I 'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything

#s89
Uh I am oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs

#s90
I guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts

#s91
and uh I 'm over the northeast part of Dallas

#s92
It 's a in a nice neighborhood

#s93
The houses here uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so

#s94
and course everything 's down ten to twenty percent now

#s97
But we have uh

#s98
one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away

#s99
and now the economy is bad

#s100
they have trouble keeping those full

#s101
so they 've dropped the uh

#s102
they 're not nearly as selective as they used to be

#s104
And course that 's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex

#s105
You start letting that happen

#s106
and they go down

#s107
and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things

#s108
so uh I 'm sure that aggravates it also

#s110
But unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point
