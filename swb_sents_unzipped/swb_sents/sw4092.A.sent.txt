#s115
No

#s116

#s121
They 're still making albums

#s125
Uh-huh

#s127
Uh

#s129
In fact I mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that

#s131
Uh

#s133
Yeah

#s134
they 're they 're like late forties early fifties

#s135
but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement

#s137


#
You know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players

#s140
They keep on dying

#s141
and they keep on replacing them

#s142
and the new one 's in this thirties you know

#s143
Uh

#s145
But uh

#s149

#s151
They just

#s152
I do n't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured

#s153

#s154
MUMBLEx

#s157
All their faces were just all shriveled

#s160
Uh-huh

#s162
I mean it just just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans

#s165
Well

#s166
uh

#s167


#
Actually I prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just uh just so that you know that if they 're jamming you know that they do n't just lose themselves and you know go into lala land

#s175
Uh-huh

#s177
Uh-huh

#s180
