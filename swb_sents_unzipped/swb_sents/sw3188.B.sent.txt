#s2
Yeah

#s3
this is a great topic for me because I just did my first two painting projects ever

#s5
Was not not a big deal

#s7
two little deals

#s8
The first one um

#s9
I helped someone repaint an apartment

#s10
and it was very easy

#s13
Yeah

#s14
and I 've never painted anyth-

#s15
I always thought it would be

#s16
so you know you 'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something

#s18
but I know I can do it

#s20
And the second one was I bought some toys at a um at a craft fair

#s22
They 're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas

#s23
and so I decided to paint them

#s24
and that was n't as easy as painting the apartment

#s26
Well it 's uh it that 's half the problem right there is that it was n't it was a oil base

#s27
so I had to get

#s28
and when I painted them I did n't realize that we did n't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house

#s29
So I had it had it all over my hands

#s30
At first I did n't realize you know

#s31
I had never painted anything

#s32
so I did n't realize that I needed that

#s34
I mean I kind of knew in the back of my mind

#s36
Well no

#s37
you can use it on wood

#s38
but I just had it all over my hands

#s39
and I went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands

#s40
and you ca n't wash it off with water

#s41
You have to get the uh a solution

#s42
and

#s44
Yeah

#s45
I had to drive to the store

#s46
yeah

#s47
I had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and MUMBLEx and everything like that

#s49
and then um downstairs in the apartment I just us- we just used a latex base

#s50
and so you can drip it on you know

#s51
if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean

#s53
Yeah

#s54
and and it it just like

#s56
the same with the toys

#s57
it 's just important to look for one that does n't have lead in it you know

#s58
it says Safe for Children and all that

#s65
Yeah

#s68
Have you painted anything recently

#s70
Wow was it huge

#s71
Uh-huh

#s76
Yeah

#s80
Wow

#s87
Yeah

#s88
I think though um we 're lucky that we did n't have to do any detail work because I do n't know if I could you know

#s89
I do n't know

#s90
I do n't know

#s91
must be difficult

#s94
No

#s95
it was j- it was really easy

#s96
I just like what

#s97
we had a couple of different size brushes you know

#s98
real easy

#s100
I went around the trim

#s101
and if it

#s102
and there was wall paper

#s103
like I was do just doing just the trim outs that around the doors and windows

#s104
and there was wall paper

#s105
and if we got it on the wall paper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried

#s107
it came right off

#s109
so there was no major mistakes

#s110
there was

#s112
Uh two actually

#s114
um and it

#s115
there was um

#s116
you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that

#s117
but that

#s120
Well yeah

#s121
if you just you know

#s122
we did n't tape anything

#s123
we were n't that careful

#s124
but it was n't you know

#s125
I do n't know

#s126
it 's it 's funny

#s127
it 's like if you just go slow you do n't get or at least I did n't get that many mistakes

#s129
I did n't make that many mistakes

#s133
Why

#s134
Just because you 'd be afraid to do it

#s135
or have you done it before

#s139
Well it was n't

#s140
if it was my own I would have

#s141
but my friend said oh just go ahead

#s142
you just go ahead

#s143
it 's easy

#s144
I said Okay it 's your place

#s146
Well a couple of week ends

#s147
we would go down two or three hours on the weekends

#s149
and

#s151
No

#s152
there was they were doing all sorts of repairs

#s153
and there was I was just painting because I do n't know how to do anything else

#s155
So there 's a whole bunch of people

#s157
So now I feel like if I ever buy a house I can probably paint if nothing else

#s160
Yeah

#s161
But you know I went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys

#s162
and the guy said Oh get this

#s163
it 's a nice shiny gloss which was true

#s164
but I did n't realize what you know pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you do n't have latex

#s165
I do n't if

#s166
it 's worth the shine
