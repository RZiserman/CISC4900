#s2
Well it 's

#s3
I am pretty much against it

#s5
Yeah

#s6
How about you

#s8
Oh good

#s9
we can have a debate

#s11
Well like um I do n't know

#s12
I c- think that I

#s13
one of the reasons that I 'm against it is that uh um I 'm afraid of someone losing their life for s- um wrongly

#s16
Right

#s18
and uh another reason

#s19
one of the arguments that really I really actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh you know someone said to me once well imagine if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her

#s20
would n't you want to see them killed for the punishment

#s21
But then I thought about it

#s22
and I thought well the loss that I would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person

#s23
no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them

#s29
How about you

#s34
Yeah

#s35
that 's true

#s38
Uh-hum

#s44
Right

#s45
Well you know that 's true because um m- b- a lot of um these conversations I 've had on this program this these telephone conversations have revolved around um criminal you know justice

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
Or whatever

#s52
and most of the time I hear myself saying well you know we do n't have enough room left in the jails

#s53
and people crime is still climbing

#s54
and we need to have different punishments you know

#s56
but I just am scared of capital punishment I guess

#s67
Uh-huh

#s70
Right

#s71
Especially when it 's so far removed

#s72
If it 's no one that I know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life

#s77
Letting him out again

#s81
Uh-huh

#s87
Uh-huh

#s89
That 's true

#s90
You know I just recently moved to Massachusetts

#s91
I 'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment

#s92
and that was one of the questions

#s93
but uh I do know that they are notorious for paroling people

#s95
Yeah

#s96
when they 're when

#s97
and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes

#s100
And I guess they said you know sh- do you think it should be restricted

#s101
I guess if it were if if

#s102
because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment

#s104
I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense

#s106
You know violent crimes with no uh with just malicious intent

#s117
Yeah

#s120
Hang

#s122
And what is he going to do prison to the other people

#s128
Right

#s131
Well I was I saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back

#s132
she was off drugs and everything

#s134
but she said uh you know in prison you can get anything

#s135
You can any drugs you want

#s136
There 's

#s137
it it 's just like being outside

#s138
You know people find ways around

#s140
And there 's a power structure that you have bow to

#s141
and and it really is n't for some people tha- who have been there for over and over and over it really is n't uh as bad

#s142
I mean there 's

#s143
it 's not that bad of a life as it should be b- for the punishment aspect

#s146
But the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation

#s147
and maybe that 's why one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it 's not so scary anymore

#s154
Right

#s155
And what they 're going to be doing when they get out

#s168
Handed it to you

#s171
Oh oh I see

#s180
Well maybe if they could uh if they had more money or more more resources to work more on rehabilitation

#s181
I mean deep down I think every every human
