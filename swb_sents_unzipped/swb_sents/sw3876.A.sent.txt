#s3
Well I definitely think that we need to start recycling

#s4
I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until

#s5
I think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late

#s7
I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand

#s10
And that is not too far away

#s11
but I do n't know how it is there

#s12
It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much

#s13
I take my paper

#s14
I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store

#s16
and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them

#s17
and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to

#s18
and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile

#s21
Uh-huh

#s25
Yeah

#s26
It is real hard to find a spot

#s27
and then I do n't know if you note even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible

#s28
bottles

#s30
glass

#s31
that can not be it could be recycled

#s32
but there is no place to

#s34
No

#s35
We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out

#s37
And I think that is what it is going to have to come to Where we are just forced to

#s40
Yeah

#s41
I think so

#s42
just because they have to You know

#s45
Right

#s46
uh-huh

#s47
And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the

#s48
it 's It 's trouble for me to do what I do

#s50
I mean I am willing to do it

#s51
but

#s53
Yeah

#s55
Yeah

#s56
It is very difficult

#s57
Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers

#s58
and so I do n't know

#s59
I think there needs to be more places

#s60
and also I have a real strong opinion

#s61
In Iowa the state I am from uh I believe it has gone up to a dollar now

#s63
Every time you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it 's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it

#s65
and then you take it back to the store

#s66
and you get it back

#s68
You are forced to

#s69
And uh you also do n't see the litter there

#s70
People just

#s73
It makes it worthwhile to take it back

#s74
and I 've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian

#s75
I do n't know if you 've tried it

#s78
and they have on the ba- it 's five cents that they pay five cents

#s80
and it even shows the states that

#s82
Yeah

#s83
Well on- some of them are five

#s84
some are ten cents

#s85
I am looking at it right now

#s87
Texas is not one of them see

#s88
So I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass

#s93
Uh-huh

#s96
Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper

#s98
Good

#s99
Because there is a lot of waste there is n't there

#s102
Right

#s103
Right

#s107
Right

#s109
Yeah

#s110
Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage

#s111
like I have decided

#s112
Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton

#s114
you add wa-

#s115
well I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later

#s116
but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first

#s118
And I want them to have my business

#s119
And I think packaging could be done much better

#s120
There is so much plastic

#s121
But

#s125
Yeah

#s126
Yeah

#s127
And I think that it 's just people have got to be aware

#s128
Unfortunately there are a lot of people that just do n't care

#s129
and they do n't want to think about it

#s132
And uh I just look at it I do n't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why did n't you do something

#s133
You know I want to feel like I at least tried

#s135
And I do n't know

#s136
It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it

#s137
Then we will be forced to

#s138
It may be too late

#s140
Very little

#s141
That 's another thing that

#s142
see there were no

#s144
I know Amway

#s145
I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material

#s146
Well that does n't do me any good because I do n't have any place to burn it

#s150
Yeah

#s151
And then just like the glass bottles that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents but not in Texas

#s153
And there is no place I can take glass to

#s155
So I still throw away a lot of glass

#s157
Yeah

#s158
And then the packaging thing really grips me

#s159
You buy some

#s160
and it 's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic
