That 's a good question

#s3
Uh there would be a point there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed

#s4
But uh since I 've become a parent and since I 've seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that

#s5
I really uh I I ca n't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people

#s7
And uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment

#s8
Uh

#s16
Oh it 's a uh it 's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response

#s19
Uh a- and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question

#s20
and he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion uh a gut level reaction

#s22
And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level Uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting peop- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill

#s24
I think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reason humane one

#s35
That 's true

#s37
Uh th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent

#s38
and I really do n't uh agree with that

#s39
I do n't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well I was about to kill and dismember this person

#s40
but oh if they catch me they 're going to kill me

#s41
so I better not do it

#s42
I I just do n't think that uh that it works that way

#s48
Uh-huh

#s55
Well I I do n't know if that would really work that way or not

#s56
Uh there 's a lot of violence
