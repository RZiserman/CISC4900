#s3
Yes

#s4
Yes

#s7
Uh-huh

#s11
Yeah

#s12
I I agree with you although I will say

#s13
I 'm not sure you know

#s14
I sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was was because they were abused a- abused as children

#s15
And the parents are saying Hey wait a minute

#s16
we did n't do anything like that you know

#s18
and and and I guess before I 'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be a an absolute certainty you know like uh caught at it or something

#s22
you know or if they they uh you know severely beat up on a child or you know I would have absolutely no problem at all you know with with

#s24
I do n't buy the routine oh they 're just sick

#s25
or they were abused when they were little

#s27
well you know forget that

#s30
Uh-huh

#s33
Well but I ca n't see that either

#s34
I do n't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag- uh you know reason to not use capital punishment

#s40
I think uh I think if I wanted to badly enough I could convince somebody uh I was crazy

#s41
so my family may say that on occasion

#s42
who knows

#s43
you know uh I I do n't think it 's that hard to do you know to to convince somebody that uh Gee you just had no control over what you were doing

#s49
Uh-huh

#s50
Uh-huh

#s54
That 's the new one

#s62
Well you you 're right uh

#s63
and yet I mean did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this

#s65
No

#s67
MUMBLEx

#s69
Ye-

#s70
well yes

#s71
I but I was from conservative Wisconsin

#s72
and uh you know there was there was nothing on it which makes me wonder you know if it 's as uh prevalent as as some of them claim

#s74
It uh it it it 's

#s75
you just do n't know

#s76
and it all

#s77
unless they 're caught in the act or the- the- the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing

#s80
Now Texas is capital punishment for

#s81
it used to be just capital murder

#s82
and now the- they added mass murder

#s83
Are those the only two things that we uh

#s86
uh you know because I have a feeling it is

#s87
and I I think there ought to be more things added to it

#s89
Uh

#s91
Yeah

#s92
I I think that 's I you know uh

#s93
killing a child or kidnapping uh

#s94
and possibly not well

#s95
I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know

#s96
if they release them two hours later he probably does n't deserve the death penalty
