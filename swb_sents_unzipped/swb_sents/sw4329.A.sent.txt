#s1
Okay

#s2
so I guess it starts recording now

#s4
Okay

#s5
I do n't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we 're in

#s6
We live in the Saginaw area

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
And I 'm not real familiar with uh anything that

#s10
I

#s11
fact as far as I know the school does n't have any kind of programs or anything out here And uh or the grocery store or anything in this area

#s13
yeah

#s21
Uh-huh

#s26
Really

#s28
That is pretty good

#s29
I 'm we 're originally from another state

#s30
and I know in the state we were from that they did that t- similar type thing

#s31
The city brought ought you know set tr- separate trash cans

#s32
and you separated your stuff

#s33
and you put it in there

#s34
and they took it you know

#s36
I do n't really know

#s38
I do n't really know

#s39
they they started after we moved down here

#s40
and so I I 'm not really familiar

#s42
I just know that uh my in-laws up in up in Oklahoma that 's how they do you know they pick it up

#s43
but I do n't know if they get a get anything back on it

#s44
or do you get money for it

#s48
Oh

#s50
Really

#s52
Right

#s54
Right

#s55
And now now most of them are throwaway

#s58
I think now they 're a lot more expensive than that

#s59
Uh I bought some Cokes the other day in the br- the little bottles you know

#s61
and I think the bottles were like I know they were at least ten cents apiece

#s62
I started to see at home

#s63
I was like God how much were those bottles you know

#s65
And it was they come in like uh eight and and eight and ten packs you know instead of six packs

#s67
and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles

#s68
You know I was like God Almighty

#s69
it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes

#s72
In the bot- MUMBLEx

#s75
Right

#s77
Oh really

#s78
Of green glass

#s81
Well out in this area they really do n't have anything

#s82
Now I know that like Minyard 's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front Uh different colors for different things and and things like that

#s85
but I I do know some of these places were doing that

#s86
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them

#s91
Yeah

#s96
Yeah

#s97
more than it 's worth

#s102
Right

#s103
Well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away

#s107
Right

#s108
