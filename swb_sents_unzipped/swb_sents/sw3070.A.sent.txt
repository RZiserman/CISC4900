#s3
Well

#s5
on my father 's side we 've really there uh

#s7
On my mother 's side we 've had several

#s8
not it 's not really on a regular basis

#s10
but usually sometimes every few summers

#s11
Well all see all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about

#s13
So they 're pretty much just reunited always

#s15
so it 's it 's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together

#s17
I know

#s18
that 's

#s20
MUMBLEx do that

#s21
that 's true

#s23
How about your family

#s25
Wow

#s26
you 're a pro at this

#s28
Oh that 's good

#s32
And then where do you meet

#s34
Okay

#s36
Okay

#s37
Do you have relatives in Vernon then

#s39
Okay

#s43
Right

#s46
Oh

#s48
Right

#s51
Oh

#s53
Right

#s59
Okay

#s60
so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um

#s63
Okay

#s67
MUMBLEx

#s68
Potato salad and uh

#s70
Oh that 's good

#s73
Right

#s75
Right

#s77
Oh that 's nice

#s80
Right

#s82
Do they always have the the one person in the family who knows or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best so that 's what they get to cook

#s84
Well that 's good

#s85
Well I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions

#s86
so I learned a lot about them

#s87
I have n't been to a lot

#s89
but we talked a lot about the the rituals

#s91
you all equated the family reunions as with the Protestant

#s93
It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage

#s95
It was it was an interesting theory

#s96
She talked about the uh the Catholics

#s97
all it 's a home centered you know it 's all family centered anyway

#s98
so you usually are living where your parents live

#s99
and it 's all

#s100
your you do n't have to come home

#s101
so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe

#s102
but when the Protestant ethic happened in America there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home for their reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage

#s105
But she had

#s106
it was interesting you know

#s107
I do n't know how valid it is

#s108
but she talked about that and how the the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and um you know about the bread and the ritual placement

#s109
Do you have a a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every every year

#s110
Is there kind of a you know

#s111
salads go first and things like that

#s114
Right

#s118
Well that 's pretty MUMBLEx

#s122
Sure does

#s123
That 's wonderful

#s127
Yeah

#s128
I wish we 'd

#s132
Right

#s141
Right

#s147
Wow

#s148
You 're just uh

#s149
Oh that 's incredible

#s152
Right

#s156
Right

#s160
Have you have you done this repetitively or just once

#s166
Oh

#s171
See that 's

#s172
we 've we had a problem with that

#s176
Oh

#s180
Right

#s181
That 's our was our problem

#s182
We had uh the first reunion or the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago

#s184
And then the second reunion people who maybe you know had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought oh well it 's not that big a thing this year

#s186
and so it kind of wound down

#s188
and then finally you know you 're lucky to get you know you get the Shreveport relatives there but no one else

#s189
so that
