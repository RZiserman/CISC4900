Well a-

#s3
for

#s4
I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama

#s5
So whenever I think of family reunions

#s6
my family like got together almost every week

#s8
And there would be like thirty people

#s9
So people talk about you know big family reunions

#s10
and I think like

#s11
I have a friend who just went to like Wyoming to some big ranch you know where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion

#s13
And I

#s14
so I mean how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives

#s16
Because I since I came from

#s17
my father has uh five sisters and two brothers

#s18
and my mother has four brothers and two sisters

#s19
So I ca-

#s20
both of my parents had big families

#s21
and we always wer- we always got together just always

#s22
Now it 's different because I live here

#s23
and I

#s24
you know when I go home I try to see the families as much of the family as I can

#s25
but it 's real different

#s27
And I grew up in a real not I think not normal setting

#s29
Right

#s30
I mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother 's

#s31
and you know like I said there would be thirty you know thirty people

#s32
and everyone would just bring things

#s33
and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook

#s35
And i-

#s41
Uh-huh

#s45
Yeah

#s46
I guess so

#s47
It sounds like it was fun
