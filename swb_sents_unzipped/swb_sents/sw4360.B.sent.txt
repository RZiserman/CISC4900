Well I would say as far as social changes go uh I think families were more together

#s5
They they did more things together

#s7
Uh they ate dinner at the table together

#s8
Uh the parents usually took out time uh you know more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity

#s10
Uh although I 'm not a mother I I still think that uh a lot has changed since ten years ago

#s11
Uh what do you think about that

#s14
Yeah

#s16
Uh-huh

#s21
Yes

#s22
What about like as far as uh social changes in the individual

#s23
Do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let 's say ten twenty years ago

#s27
Uh-huh

#s29
Well how how old are you

#s31
Twenty-eight

#s32
Okay

#s33
I 'm twenty-three

#s35
So there 's maybe a five year gap between us

#s37
So uh

#s40
Huh

#s41
Yes

#s42
Uh-huh

#s44
Do you think it 's an economic c- necessity

#s45
or do you think that we 're we 're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living

#s48
I mean do you think people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs

#s49
or

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s60
Yeah

#s61
Uh-huh

#s62
Okay

#s63
Uh-huh

#s65
Yo- so you think it 's

#s66
which group are you saying is the one trying

#s68
Uh-huh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
Okay

#s74
Okay

#s75
And then sometimes I I often uh find that maybe there 's so many different things available to us a microwave a V C R a answering machine a you know a special a dishwasher uh a refrigerator and some of those items um for the for the uh

#s77
well I guess we 're sticking more to social changes

#s78
but uh people want all of that

#s80
and not all of those are necessities

#s82
So they 're trying to

#s83
it has become a necessity
