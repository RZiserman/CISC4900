I 'm already on my job

#s6
so you you reached me at my job

#s9
My my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt

#s11
The um thing that that distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is I wear a clerical collar and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing

#s13
but when I do n't need to dress up for a a meeting or a service of some sort I do n't

#s16
Yes

#s24
Well around there you can probably wear uh T-shirts and other things

#s25
but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and uh coats

#s35
Today today we we wear coats

#s36
and as the day uh warms up we may go to light jackets

#s38
but I do n't think there 's an escape from light jackets

#s40
The wind will take away a lot of body heat

#s42
Very similar

#s45
No

#s46
I 'm not stuck with that kind of a uh situation

#s49
As I say unless it happens to be

#s50
now yesterday I had to dress up and and uh be more formal because I had a a formal meeting at noon time

#s52
but then I can go home later in the day and and be a little more casual

#s54
and then if I have a a meeting of people that I know I can be very casual in the evening

#s60
Yeah

#s61
that 's around here in a lot of places that 's the way it is

#s63
I mean there there are ex- expected uh dress codes

#s65
and the people need to follow that

#s66
I think uh years ago I used to be far more uh committed to the idea of of a dress code

#s68
but I 've relaxed a lot more as I 've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself

#s71
It 's taken a long time to break away from from that

#s73
but now that I 've broken away from it I 'm I 'm glad I have

#s77
You mean you do n't need to wear little old house dresses any more

#s83
That 's a good idea

#s84
that 's a good idea

#s86
No

#s87
there you know

#s89
Yeah

#s90
what kind what kind of shoes do they wear down there

#s93
Uh-huh

#s96
We we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in in almost every every situation unless you want to look like a gook

#s104
A lot different

#s107
You too

#s108
and thank you for calling

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
