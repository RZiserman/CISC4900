Are you there

#s4
Okay

#s5
now tell me your favorite team

#s7
Yes

#s11
Okay

#s12
I think it 's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us

#s13
where do you think they 're headed

#s14
so we 'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers

#s17
What are your thinkings on what they can do what they 'll be able to do

#s22
Well I heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his

#s26
Yes

#s27
And the Rangers go up a little bit

#s28
uh-huh

#s30
I think the entire baseball

#s31
yeah

#s32
they 're the ones that probably are paying the highest

#s35
And I think this is absolutely ridiculous

#s37
No

#s42
That 's right

#s47

What I saw on the news today that Bu- Buechele was back just to visit

#s50
I 'm awful sorry he 's not still

#s54
Oh I 'm sure it was

#s59
Pittsburgh

#s60
Yeah

#s63
Yes sir

#s65
Well what do you think of Howse who is the coach for the pitchers

#s67
Yes

#s70
His assistant

#s71
Uh-huh

#s75
I really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse

#s77
No

#s78
no

#s79
I really do n't

#s80
And I 'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that

#s81
but I 'm not fond of Howse

#s82
and I 'm not fond of Grieves

#s84
Yeah

#s90
Well I 'm just gullible enough that I think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right

#s91
and I 'm sure

#s93
Well

#s95
Oh I know

#s96
I know so

#s97
but I would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together and give um oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs

#s100
I understand

#s104
Well I just oh I have so many mixed emotions about all this

#s105
But I think with their new stadium they should go and let
