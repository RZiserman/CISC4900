#s1
Well Steve did you go to college

#s4
Oh that 's good

#s5
So you probably could give some great advice

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
Well what 's your ca- what 's your interest

#s10
your uh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
That that 's similar to what

#s15
I 'm in a P H D program right now

#s17
And uh my area of expertise it 's information systems which is a little bit less technical I think than uh than computer science

#s18
But my area of expertise is uh uh human computer interaction

#s20
And I think that 's one reason why I 'm part of this study uh because it 's of I 'm working with voice systems

#s22
Yeah

#s23
So so good luck

#s24
I guess we should talk about giving advice though

#s25
Wh- what what type of advice do you think you 'd give to a a parent

#s27
Yeah

#s30
Uh-huh

#s31
Yeah

#s33
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s38
I think that 's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change

#s40
I kn- I know very few people that uh started in one field and stayed with it

#s41
You know they

#s42
I think that 's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh

#s43
I think that 's much more important

#s44
I I think I 'd I 'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know that uh some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer

#s45
but some of the uh the small some of the larger small schools you know I guess around three or four thousand students have a can offer a broader range of curriculums and things

#s47
so if the kid does change they do n't have to transfer

#s48
or they do n't have to uh uh

#s49
I do n't know

#s50
they do n't have to give up years of you know of credit transfer and things

#s53
Yeah

#s54
I normally

#s55
and and parents hate to hear this you know

#s56
because I I actually teach college

#s57
I hate to uh I hate to talk to the parents

#s58
because um one of the reasons is because you know the kid does n't know exactly what they want

#s59
and I always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it 's not going to be your career vocation because you 'll get better grades

#s60
I I think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration

#s62
Does that make sense

#s66
Yeah

#s67
I always you know tell them that you should major in something you you 're going to get good grades in Because that that 's always I think more important you know overall

#s69
I do n't know

#s71
Yeah

#s72
Oh you you 're at the office now

#s74
At work

#s75
Yeah

#s81
I would I would it would

#s84
I I tell you

#s85
I live in Maryland

#s86
and the public schools here are pretty good

#s87
I teach at a public school actually

#s88
and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch- a lot of the private schools

#s89
And um I actually I would full time at a at a public school

#s90
and then right now I 'm teaching part time at a private school at a Catholic institution

#s92
And um and I really think I think I 'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school because I think their parents pay more

#s93
and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated where at the public school I do n't think as many parents are public are are college educated

#s94
and I do n't I think because it costs less the kid does n't take it quite as serious you know

#s95
they 're not

#s96
it it 's the minimal cost

#s97
But I think you can get a good education at public or private

#s98
but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know

#s99
I

#s101
you have to really you have to look around at the school

#s102
I I think the bad part is that most parents or kids do n't know what to look for

#s107
Uh-huh

#s109
Right

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s113
Right

#s117
Right

#s118
Yeah

#s119
does it have a big ten football team

#s120
or

#s124
Yeah

#s125
I mean uh yeah

#s126
is it a PAC ten school you know

#s128
But I think

#s129
yeah

#s130
see I 'm I 'm at the University of Maryland

#s131
so in this this region um though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland

#s132
my diploma will still say University of Maryland

#s134
Um you know it does n't does n't differentiate on my diploma

#s135
though I would put it on my resume what program I went to

#s136
But I I think you know I 'm actually at a smaller program

#s137
I 'm not at the col- the big College Park campus you know

#s138
that 's the big one with the football team

#s140
So I I think um I think you 're right that there 's a lot of there 's difficult decisions there based on name recognition

#s141
Um you know when I first was applying for graduate schools I applied to some big programs you know in this area like Stevens Institute of Technology which is recognized in the Northeast as as you know one step below M I T in a sense you know

#s143
so it 's got big name recognition in this area

#s144
a big science school no football team but a big science school

#s146
and technical people know that

#s147
But I don-

#s148
yeah

#s149
I think you 're right

#s150
you really have to think about that for the job

#s151
I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor 's

#s152
and when I

#s153
now I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs

#s154
I was going to be a teacher

#s155
I was just a high school teacher

#s156
so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of

#s158
you know but then when I went um for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know Shippensburg State

#s159
where is that you know

#s162
And you know when I went into higher education even at other universities they were n't aware of it you know

#s164
So I think yeah

#s165
that 's important

#s166
um I think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job

#s167
you need that first job or so out of school too

#s174
Uh-huh

#s175
yeah

#s177
Right

#s180
Uh-huh

#s181
Right

#s182
Yeah

#s183
depending on your technical areas

#s184
Yeah

#s186
I could see that

#s187
But you know at some of the large schools I know that at at at University of Maryland where I am you know in a P H D program I I have n't even met uh someone outside of my area of information systems except for
