Okay

#s5
I watch evenings because I work all day

#s6
I used to watch daytimes

#s8
Um mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN that kind of thing

#s10
And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE

#s11
but now it 's mainly evenings

#s13
Yes

#s15
I tape THIRTY SOMETHING and L A LAW

#s17
Those are the two I like the best

#s20
I know

#s21
It 's going to be history I know

#s25
Uh-huh

#s29
Oh well Well

#s33
Uh-huh

#s36
I know

#s37
I 'm amazed

#s39
Huh-uh

#s40
I 'm surprised that I was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening and different things

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s45
I know

#s48
I know

#s49
Is n't that funny

#s52
Oh I do n't usually like stuff that continues

#s53
That 's why I 'm surprised I like those two shows because usually I like you know stuff that just ends sort of that you just you do n't have to have watched you know

#s55
Yeah

#s56
I mean you do n't have to

#s58
Yeah

#s59
You do n't have to have watched it last week in order to follow

#s60
so you know I usually do n't like that

#s63
Uh-huh

#s65
I know

#s67
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s78
Uh-huh

#s84
Huh-uh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s93
And what night is it on

#s102
Oh great

#s106
Oh

#s111
Huh

#s116
Uh-huh

#s122
Uh-huh

#s132
So he did n't go howl

#s136
Oh how funny

#s147
It 's just a half hour

#s148
or is it hour

#s153
There 's not many half hour shows

#s154
it seems like that

#s163
Yeah

#s164
no

#s165
I watch those if I

#s167
Oh see I like sports

#s177
Uh-huh

#s186
No

#s189
I know

#s190
Who has time

#s191
I do n't have time to sit I know

#s193
It 's it 's uh

#s194
That 's why I do n't get to watch that much

#s195
I mean I watch nine o'clock

#s196
Right

#s197
I do okay because the kids are all in bed

#s198
but before that I really there 's not much time

#s200
Or like at six thirty I 'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that

#s206
Uh-huh

#s207
No

#s208
I like that

#s209
No

#s210
