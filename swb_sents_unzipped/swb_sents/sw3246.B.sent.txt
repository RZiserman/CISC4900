#s2
Well yes

#s3
I do

#s4
Um I think I 'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way

#s5
I think maybe we 've given our teachers a almost impossible job

#s7
Do you

#s8
Do you have children in the public school system

#s11
Is that right

#s15
You were a bookkeeper

#s16
Oh

#s20
Oh no

#s22
Well um I 'm I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back

#s23
and and I 'm just really in a dilemma if that 's what you know

#s24
I love to work with children and to teach them

#s26
but I 'm really having questions if if I can deal with that system and and have a good conscience about you know what I do

#s27
I do n't think I do n't think it 's the teachers

#s28
I think it 's the system

#s30
but um

#s32
Right

#s36
What child 's going to say something some parent 's going to overreact to

#s39
that 's that 's true

#s40
Well it 's it 's hard on the children too I think you know because the um the teachers are overworked

#s41
and just like a mommy that 's overworked you 're not at your best you know um

#s44
I have two

#s45
I have in the system

#s46
one is in ninth grade

#s47
and one is in seventh grade

#s48
and them um I 'm home schooling my kindergartner this year

#s50
We um live in a district that has open classrooms

#s51
and I was n't particularly comfortable with that for her

#s54
Yes

#s57
You too

#s62
Oh

#s64
Still at it

#s65
Well the explanation I was was given about you know

#s66
they they seemed to admit that it was n't working

#s67
but they did n't have the money to restructure

#s68
but looks to me that it would n't take really that much money to at least come up with I mean some kind of partitions you know

#s71
Just

#s72
yeah

#s74
Oh goodness

#s76
Oh

#s79
Were they

#s81
Well we were from North um Carolina

#s82
and of course North North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education

#s83
I think they rank about forty-ninth

#s85
but our children got a very good education there

#s87
they were in the magnet school program

#s88
and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons

#s89
but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes

#s91
and it was wonderful

#s93
so you know I 'm coming to to Plano thinking Well gosh it 's going to be really great

#s94
it 's ranked so much better

#s98
Is n't that interesting

#s99
I I I do n't understand how they get this this reputation unless it 's just that they spend a lot of money

#s100
I do n't know

#s103
I guess so

#s105
Well my son is at Clark this year too

#s106
so uh we 're

#s108
Yeah

#s110
And uh he 's pleased with his classes

#s111
I I I do n't guess I 've been in the high school long enough to to know what to expect really you know how to judge it

#s118
Well that 's good

#s119
Yeah

#s122
Well Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he does n't have any

#s123
so that 's interesting

#s124
but he his grades I have n't seen them yet

#s125
but supposedly they 're good

#s126
so

#s131
That 's right
