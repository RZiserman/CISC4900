I went I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon

#s7
Are you eating

#s12
No it 's

#s13
Say what

#s15
Tell you what we can do is uh I can punch the uh one

#s16
and then w- after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want

#s20
Uh I love the irony of uh talking about this subject on April the fifteenth

#s21
But uh I 'm afraid I 'm I 'm probably in the minority

#s22
I I actually do n't think that we uh pay too much in this country Uh uh particularly uh in this part of the country w-

#s24
uh I guess I do have a a bone to pick with uh uh the way taxes are distributed

#s25
Uh I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form

#s27
and the sales tax ca n't

#s28
I think that 's regressive

#s29
and uh uh it 's kind of dumb

#s33
Well I mean nobody taxes groceries

#s36
Where

#s38
Is that right

#s42
Right

#s44
Right

#s45
But I guess when I hear when I see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty-one forty-two and ours are like thirty-six thirty-seven you know

#s46
if you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well

#s47
T- th- there 's no other country that 's that is taxed as low as we are

#s49
Yeah

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
I 'm I 'm not sure I understand what you mean

#s54
Right

#s56
Oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher taxes

#s57
Yeah

#s60
I suppose that 's true

#s61
yeah

#s62
Uh probably m- less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever

#s63
but

#s65
Yeah

#s67
Right

#s71
Right

#s73
Right

#s74
Yeah

#s75
Yeah

#s76
since uh I send my kids to parochial school that MUMBLEx

#s79
It 's not it 's not quite the bargain that MUMBLEx

#s80
But I mean I pay them gladly

#s81
That 's a decision

#s82
I think it 's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f- with the same tax money

#s83
But uh I mean that 's that 's the way Americans want to interpret it

#s84
I guess that 's all right

#s85
But

#s86
yeah

#s87
I

#s88
and if I were uh

#s89
when I was single and again when I 'm retired I will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good

#s90
That 's always been a high priority

#s93
I do

#s94
yeah

#s95
that 's true

#s96
I think in places I think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the uh uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are uh just looking for fun th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they ca n't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens

#s98
And uh there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they ca n't get anything done

#s99
That seems a a like a cultural lapse

#s100
I mean people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools

#s101
They

#s103
Right

#s104
Yeah

#s105
People would rather uh increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them

#s106
But I think it 's sad selfish and shortsighted

#s108
Yeah

#s109
Well
