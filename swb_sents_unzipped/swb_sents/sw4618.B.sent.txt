#s2
Uh have you every been tested for a new job or anything

#s9
So it 's just sort of uh

#s10
they can if they

#s12
Oh okay

#s15
Uh not really

#s16
but I 've always worked on a university level

#s17
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff

#s20
Uh I do n't I do n't think they 're very accurate

#s21
because I mean I know their lifestyles changed p- prior to the drug test

#s22
and I know they changed afterwards

#s30
Yeah

#s31
I I had a friend

#s32
it did n't cause her any problems with her job

#s33
but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen

#s34
But what it was was she had been u- she had been uh in the jungle

#s35
and it was some Malaria medication

#s36
and she tested positive for that

#s43
See I always

#s44
I thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests

#s49
How do you know how wrong they are

#s50
Are they I mean is there a margin of error

#s56
Yeah

#s61
Uh-huh

#s66
Yeah

#s67
Yeah

#s69
And I I 'm not so sure they are that needed

#s72
I mean Ye-

#s75
if you 're using it while at a job I can see a problem

#s77
But the occasional person then it 's almost like it 's almost an infringement of your privacy

#s83
Yeah

#s87
Yeah

#s89
Yeah

#s95
And it it 's like it seems like now they have tests

#s96
I guess they can test your hair

#s97
and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago

#s101
So

#s102
I know

#s106
Yeah

#s107
There 's a lot of things you do as a kid that you would n't do as an adult

#s109
but you ca n't say it was wrong at the time
