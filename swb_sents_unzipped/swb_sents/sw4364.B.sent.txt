Well uh one of the things that uh that I found to be uh an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the on the uh credit card bill

#s3
That is something that is not required

#s6
and in fact uh it is actually prohibited

#s7
but it does n't stop many people many people from uh from doing it

#s8
And it 's o- one of the things that it 's used for primarily is for demographic uh research And to get th- your your phone number on uh uh lists for phone solicitations

#s18
Uh-huh

Oh here 's an easy way to make some money

#s42
But uh I do n't know if that 's been challenged in the courts or not

#s43
I I 've heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state

#s44
Uh the budget problems up here are are pretty tense

#s45
And people are looking for alternate ways of uh

#s46
en- enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use

#s47
And they were talking about selling the D M V lists

#s48
and there was a lot of uh a lot of uh consternation about that

#s49
and the last I heard they 'd backed down from that idea

#s50
But it really makes you wonder what other lists you 're own that have been made uh public that you do n't know about
