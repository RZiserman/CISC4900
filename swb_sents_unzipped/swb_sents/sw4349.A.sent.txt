#s1
The last auto repair I had was

#s2
I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck

#s3
I had a tune up done

#s4
and I had I had the brakes done on it

#s5
and then the reason I did that was because I do n't have a scope

#s6
and it has eight spark plugs

#s7
and it 's hard to to get get at them

#s8
and plus the time them

#s9
I just do n't have time any more

#s10
Uh as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself I I usually change the oil and wash the air filter

#s11
and I I had an occasion to change to have to change the battery once

#s12
but the brakes I was really surprised that the brakes

#s13
I wanted

#s14
I do have the background

#s15
I know what needs to be done

#s16
and I know that the oil needs should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings

#s17
and the lube lubrication system needs to be lubricated

#s18
and so I I stay on top of that

#s19
but I I wanted my front wheels

#s20
I wanted the bearings packed

#s21
and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh a front or something like that

#s22
or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it

#s24
just to pack the bearings

#s25
but what I found is that they had a brake job

#s26
and they

#s27
I had them

#s28
the other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics

#s29
That 's free

#s30
okay

#s31
And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it see

#s33
And they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know

#s34
but still it was cheaper in the long run

#s35
and uh

#s36
so I just got the the brakes done

#s37
and I thought that was a good deal

#s38
And plus

#s41
and they re- repacked the the wheel bearings

#s42
Yeah

#s43
but uh I 've I 've had considerable experience

#s44
I 'm you might say I 'm uh uh good back yard mechanic

#s45
and I you know I took auto shop in high school

#s46
it 's been a while back

#s47
but I I still have a pretty good feel for it

#s48
but one thing I did n't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars

#s49
I I had bigger cars

#s50
and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those

#s51
and what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan

#s52
I bought the truck with about sixty thousand

#s53
I have almost one hundred and ten

#s54
so I drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty-five thousand miles

#s55
and there was hardly any wear to them

#s56
So those small little trucks and cars like that they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good

#s59
Exa- Exactly

#s60
so I you know I just did it anyway

#s61
I like to I like to stay up on it

#s62
You know like I just kind of stay up on it

#s63
and then if you go and like just about any point any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say uh a white golden brown

#s64
You know it 's not dirty

#s65
I I I keep it that way because that 's that is the key to the longevity

#s68
So so how

#s69
Uh-huh

#s71
Oh

#s72
oh

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
Uh-huh

#s77
Okay

#s79
Uh-huh

#s82
You 're talking about the vibration dampener

#s85
That 's the vibration dampener

#s86
yeah

#s87
Okay

#s89
Um

#s91
Uh oh

#s93
Um

#s94
Uh oh

#s95
Huh

#s100
Uh-huh
