#s1
Yeah

#s2
Jonathan uh you s- you say it 's near and dear to your heart

#s3
Buying a car is uh something you 're contemplating I take it

#s5
Uh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Uh

#s13
Uh-huh

#s16
Wow They get

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
What do you think you 'll uh what kind of a car do you think you 'll buy next

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
Uh-huh

#s25
Well I think the next car we get will probably be a

#s26
well I I like Buicks

#s27
We have a Buick Century now

#s28
it 's a nineteen eighty-seven

#s30
and uh whatever I get I want to have uh air bags uh both driver 's and passenger side and four door because it 's much more convenient if you 're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over

#s31
so I think the four door is probably a major requirement

#s33
and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car

#s34
Uh you know I 'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh

#s36
something that will carry it around careful I guess is best best way to describe it

#s37
Right now we 've got a V six

#s38
and it that seems to be just fine

#s39
I know they s- they 're coming out with some V eight now

#s40
and I think that 's probably a little over kill for this day and age

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
Right

#s47
I uh I drive a a truck a Ford truck

#s48
I I like trucks because they 're spacious

#s49
and it 's handy to haul things

#s50
Uh it 's not related to my business

#s51
I just really use it basically for transportation

#s52
but there 's so many occasions when I 've had to move some members of the family or do this or that

#s53
and it 's it 's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one

#s56
Traction

#s58
Uh not really uh you know

#s59
it 's a two wheel drive truck

#s60
and I figure if it 's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway

#s64
Wow

#s69
Uh-huh

#s71
What kind of what make is the mini van

#s73
Mazda

#s74
I see

#s79
Right

#s81
One of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager I guess

#s84
and uh they have a a child that 's five years old

#s85
and it 's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff

#s86
and of course as he gets friends I 'm sure that will be even handier

#s87
So I know if we were if we had kids still at home we 're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we 'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value

#s91
What about uh all wheel drive

#s92
Is that something that you 'd be interested in

#s93
or is that

#s95
Uh-huh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s99
Right
