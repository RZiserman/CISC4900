#s3
Uh-huh

#s5
Uh-huh

#s8
Well I 'm uh I I was just uh in high school I guess when it when it ended

#s10
Ended up being

#s11
I was in the last last lottery

#s13
And I was glad it was over by then

#s15
I 've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there

#s16
Just because you know we did n't really do anything when we went over it seems like

#s18
You know we uh

#s19
those people that I know

#s20
I work with several that were over there

#s21
and for some of them it was just kind of I do n't know not so much a holiday

#s22
I guess that 's how they tend to talk about it

#s23
But that they just kind of lived out in the woods

#s24
and ever now and then they 'd go and shoot their rifles

#s25
and then they 'd come back

#s26
and you know

#s28
But that they were n't really allowed to do anything

#s29
I uh

#s30
to me it seems like we only went halfway If even halfway

#s34
Uh-huh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s41
Yeah

#s44
Uh-huh

#s51
Uh-huh

#s56
Yeah

#s57
Well I I I think we did I think we did learn some lessons that we were n't uh we were n't prepared for

#s58
I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war

#s60
Uh I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war

#s61
I mean they seemed like a valiant thing

#s63
You knew you knew who was good

#s64
You knew who was bad

#s66
And it was a it was a traditional m- the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is

#s68
But in in the Vietnam war it seems like it was

#s69
a a the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who 's good and who 's bad

#s70
and and uh you know the

#s73
even it seems like even the people you know

#s74
had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and of course the Laotians

#s75
and the Cambodians were n't even supposed to be involved

#s76
But

#s81
Yeah

#s82
Yeah

#s87
Yeah
