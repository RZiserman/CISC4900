Um well actually usually uh in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work uh

#s4
usually catch the news in the morning

#s7
Uh N B C

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Yeah

#s16
Yeah

#s17
I usually tend to just you know rely on you know T V uh again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like you know like what today 's stories are

#s18
and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I 'm interested in any particular one

#s22
Yeah

#s23
I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all

#s28
Well what I really do n't like about T V especially local news as compared to like national news is just uh it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed

#s29
and you know it 's it 's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is your kid 's bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
Yeah

#s36
Also also I have the observation of uh with the press is that like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had more than just a blurb about it That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story

#s39
it 's something wrong

#s42
Uh-huh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
Yeah

#s51
the farm report

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
Also I have found that newspapers probably are n't as bad as television MUMBLEx

#s58
Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down

#s59
and

#s63
Was that like he started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something

#s66
Uh-huh

#s68
Uh-huh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s72
Oh yeah

#s73
I have seen that happen lots of times

#s74
You know Channel X gives you the best coverage

#s75
you know we were on the scene with our team players

#s76
and

#s80
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s84
Uh-huh

#s86
They are trying to get the you know most emotional response for

#s91
Yeah

#s93
Yeah

#s94
yeah

#s95
You know I 've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know

#s97
uh you know even the national news I just find it to be you know very watered down

#s99
very

#s101
Uh I fou- I found it very one sided

#s103
Uh you know it it just seemed to lack any sort of debate

#s105
Uh you know not saying that we shou- that we actually should have been there or should n't have been there

#s106
but it just seemed like you know

#s109
Uh-huh

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s115
Uh-huh

#s116
Yeah

#s117
and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press
