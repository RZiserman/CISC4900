Well what kind of vacations do you like to take MUMBLEx

#s4
Uh-huh

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Yeah

#s8
Where have you gone there

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s15
Yeah

#s16
well I 've been over there too

#s19
I even

#s20
Let 's see um

#s21
mostly Germany and France

#s23
I lived in France for a year and a half

#s24
so I was able

#s26
but I once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany

#s28
because uh I 've got relatives there

#s29
and I just like it there

#s32
So but um Austria I found really pretty and Switzerland

#s34
yeah

#s35
and I I lived in the Alps in France

#s36
so I anything in the mountains over there I just love

#s39
Then I finally made it to England too uh on my way home um

#s40
I lived in Africa actually

#s41
and on my way home from there

#s43
Yeah

#s45
Yeah

#s47
So um and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from Nairobi you have to fly through um uh Europe on your way home

#s49
So I went to England

#s50
and I really liked it there too

#s52
I know

#s53
it 's true

#s54
That 's the one thing

#s59
Yeah

#s60
Yeah

#s61
actually now you can get some really good deals flying over

#s62
but it 's

#s64
once you 're there you still have to spend money Unless you know people you know

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
That helps a lot

#s73
But

#s75
Uh-huh

#s78
Yeah

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
Yeah

#s84
I have n't

#s85
I 've been I 've

#s86
most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast

#s88
or this summer I went to Colorado

#s90
and uh I 'd love to go to the East Coast during the Fall

#s96
Yeah

#s99
Uh-huh

#s101
Uh-huh

#s104
Yeah

#s107
Uh-huh

#s108
I have n't been there anywhere on the East Coast

#s110
I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I 've been

#s112
Yeah

#s114
Yeah

#s115
I guess so

#s118
Uh-huh

#s120
Yeah

#s123
Uh-huh

#s124
Yeah

#s126
Yeah

#s128
Yeah

#s129
So the type of vacation you 'd like um

#s130
like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week

#s132
Yeah

#s133
main- mainly probably because you want to see everything

#s136
Yeah

#s137
Yeah

#s138
I know

#s140
Yeah

#s142
Well I liked it

#s143
I was working in Cameroon Africa

#s145
and it 's not a it 's not a place for tourists

#s146
I mean they 're not used to having tourists there

#s147
so it 's

#s149
you 're kind of roughing it

#s150
But um I liked it

#s151
I liked it

#s153
The people there are just very very friendly

#s154
and

#s156
Um I was working with an organization that does Bible translation

#s158
So I was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and uh what they call survey work

#s161
Find out where the languages are

#s163
So I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people

#s165
Um

#s167
Yeah

#s168
I enjoyed it

#s169
So

#s173
Yeah

#s175
Yeah

#s176
my cousin came over while I was there

#s177
and she came to Cameroon

#s178
and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around you know close to Nairobi in Kenya

#s181
So she 'd always dreamed of doing that too

#s184
So Yeah

#s185
So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to

#s187
It sounds like we 've been to some of the same places
