#s1
Okay Karen

#s2
You- you 're first

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Okay

#s9
Yeah

#s10
I guess one of the differences I see is uh working for a university uh there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association

#s12
so there is a progressive path

#s13
but not being in the say the commercial sector the motivation is n't there for a lot of people uh like really

#s17
Yeah

#s18
somewhat that

#s19
but then also there just is n't the ability to in one sense have uh a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances

#s21
Uh so that 's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution

#s22
uh it 's a little more difficult to recognize an individual 's performance

#s24
and I suppose that 's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business uh

#s25
But I agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the uh security aspect for long term employment uh

#s30
Job security

#s31
yes

#s35
Uh-huh

#s38
Yeah

#s39
we are seeing that here as well

#s40
Like in some of the large oil companies There has been massive lay offs

#s42
Uh so I I think there it 's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in uh institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that 's what we do

#s46
But

#s48
Yeah

#s49
and institutionally like here at the university oh if there is a cut back well gee it 's not where it necessarily where it 's needed

#s50
it 's where it 's most expedient which

#s51
Well in one sense for us it 's where it makes the least noise which means it 's often the lowest support type roles

#s60
So we

#s64
It 's very easy

#s67
Yeah

#s70
Right

#s71
Because it 's support people that are providing the speed for it

#s77
Well the uh

#s78
that 's maybe the majority of the importance I guess

#s79
Yeah

#s80
because my perspective is from an institution

#s81
uh the there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe

#s84
but if you 're in the corporate world I think there is considerable motivation for I guess in- innovation

#s85
although he you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through

#s87
but uh I think there is uh it 's a long term type of process where in a small organization it 's uh things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts

#s92
Right

#s95
Yeah

#s96
You end up being your own person

#s98
and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that 's their problem

#s99
and you know you really

#s103
Yeah

#s104
Yeah

#s105
It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves
