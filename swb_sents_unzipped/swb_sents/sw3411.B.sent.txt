#s2
Well I guess Cadillac

#s3
I guess that 's kind of everybody 's dream

#s5
Oh I guess it 's a General Motors product

#s6
and I like General Motors because they 're made in the United States

#s7
and uh we 've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Oh um I think I 'd still go with the Cadillac

#s14
I do n't I do n't care about a big fancy fancy

#s16
Oh I do n't know

#s17
I guess the Seville probably or

#s19

#s29
Uh-huh

#s33
Oh yeah

#s34
Right

#s36
Yeah

#s38
Well I think the ones now with all of the uh fancy gold lettering and all you know

#s39
I think they 're very pretty

#s41
And course the top now the vin- what is it a vinyl top I think those are pretty

#s46
Uh-huh

#s48
Yeah

#s53
they look like they 're very sturdy

#s54
and you do n't have to worry that much about um getting you know hurt like you would in a small one

#s59

#s61
Yeah

#s62

#s74
Yeah

#s75

#s76
Um I I go for things you know built in the United States rather than foreign countries

#s78
Help our economy

#s79
and

#s81
Mostly Oldsmobiles

#s84
Oh yeah

#s85
That 's what we have now

#s86
but of course if I have a choice I 'd still have the Cadillac

#s87
but uh I 've been very satisfied with the with the Oldsmobiles

#s88
We 've driven them for about probably twenty years

#s90
Uh no

#s91
the Ninety-Eight

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95

#s101
Well I do n't know

#s102
The one we have has a six

#s104
Uh-huh

#s106
But it 's a very good car

#s107
It 's a had not had one minute 's problem with it

#s109
and I 've had now I have twenty-three thousand miles on it

#s111
Yeah

#s114

#s124
Uh-huh

#s127
No

#s128
it really is n't because now you can get like five year financing on them

#s129

#s133
