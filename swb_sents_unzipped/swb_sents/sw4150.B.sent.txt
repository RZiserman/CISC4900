#s2
Yes

#s5
I think w- I think we 're going to talk about parents spending time with their children

#s6
We have three children who are eleven nine and eight

#s8
So this is the big issue with us Although I do n't recall marking it on my little things to talk about

#s9
but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time

#s10
and

#s12
Anyway

#s13
You do n't have children

#s15
But you 're married

#s20
Oh

#s22
You know I know we 're not supposed to do this long distance

#s23
but actually I 'm getting a call

#s24
I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting

#s25
Could I ask you to hold one minute

#s27
I 'll be right back

#s28
Excuse me just a moment

#s30
They 're going to get mad

#s33
Hello

#s35
I 'm so sorry

#s37
That was my daughter 's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting

#s41
Well I do n't want to I do n't want this to be a unilateral conversation

#s42
but yes

#s43
we do

#s44
Both my husband and I work

#s45
and our children are sixth fourth and third grade

#s46
And the school years are wonderful

#s47
they 're just wonderful

#s49
The kids they are real people

#s50
and they are interesting

#s51
and they they have all their own activities

#s52
and um I think as parents we really enjoy them in in our personal situation

#s53
our children have not yet decided to rebel

#s56
I 'm su- sure that 's coming though

#s57
But they are wonderful kids

#s64
You had eight boys and one girl

#s70
Are you Mormons

#s72
That 's what the Utah and the large family

#s74
Well we 're Catholics

#s75
I came from a family of five

#s76
I had four brothers

#s78
the only girl

#s80
And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled

#s82
I never felt spoiled

#s83
In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed

#s85
No

#s86
Usually busy fighting for survival

#s90
Well I do think with working parents it is I mean there are some real issues here Um that I think um

#s92
I do n't know

#s93
It 's an interesting problem

#s94
I happen to um

#s95
I 'm a pediatrician

#s97
My husband is a physician

#s98
so uh I I MUMBLEx I talk to parents about this a lot

#s99
But children

#s100
I I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what 's best for them and their family

#s103
And I feel when my children were very young I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing

#s104
And I long ago decided I 'm a better mother because I work outside the home

#s106
I really believe that

#s107
And it has um helped us to afford some things for our children that we could n't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age

#s108
and I think our kids are real secure And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot

#s110
so I know it sounds like a rationalization

#s111
but it 's I really think it 's true for our family

#s113
and I think it has worked very well

#s118
There 's no question

#s119
I think that 's really the best

#s120
If if a woman is happy doing that

#s122
I hate to put it quite that way

#s124
I was twenty-nine when I had my first child

#s125
and uh I would not have been real fulfilled

#s126
I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child

#s128
It 's a wonderful it 's wonderful to be a mother

#s129
but uh I like th- I like the way I did it

#s131
I sort of worked half time

#s132
I had very flexible hours

#s133
I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year

#s134
and I you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to to mothers

#s137
Um and I think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in

#s139
Some baby-sitting groups

#s140
again I know it sounds like a rationalization

#s141
but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children

#s142
and they they learn to share

#s143
They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention

#s144
but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure

#s146
I think that helps

#s149
Well so so So your wife does she work right now

#s152
She 's out

#s156
You 're still trying to dry out
