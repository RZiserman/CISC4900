#s3
Well uh yeah

#s4
I I 'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing

#s5
and I 've got some very definite uh opinions about it Uh you know which have n't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it But uh developed a little more I guess but have n't changed that much

#s6
What about you

#s7
Are you uh in- involved at all

#s13
Yes

#s17
Yeah

#s19
Right

#s23
Yeah

#s25
Yeah

#s26
Yeah

#s27
It uh that 's that 's mine

#s28
It it you know

#s29
I I go back

#s30
it to me no matter how much the our company claims it 's not a constitutional issue That because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government

#s31
it 's not

#s32
the Constitution does n't apply

#s33
But I it it seems to me that it still should

#s34
I I our company 's doing it because they 're a uh government contractor

#s35
Uh and so it 's it 's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts

#s36
and I 'd I 'd

#s38
Yes

#s39
Okay

#s40
An- and our company has taken that and gone all the way

#s41
Say

#s42
okay uh

#s43
first off we do n't we do n't have enough courage to uh pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage uh because that would offend them uh if they if they were n't

#s44
So we 'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even

#s45
Uh and and uh

#s48
then uh

#s49
but and they

#s50
so it 's a a complete random testing

#s51
w- well it 's random in the sense that you do n't know when

#s52
It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested

#s54
Uh and uh you know I I sit at a terminal and and write software all day

#s55
It it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in in my job

#s58
And and uh yes

#s59
I I agree that there are there are uh jobs that are definitely life threatening

#s60
and and and th- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at rea- reasonable and proper

#s61
I- you know

#s69
Well

#s71
Yeah

#s72
I that that I that I will give credit to to our our company for in that that I think there 's there 's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh of drugs

#s73
And e- essentially the first thing is t- is on the order of MUMBLEx paper in the urine and uh or some you know

#s74
it 's not quite that simple

#s75
but it 's fairly simple

#s77
Coarse kind of test

#s78
And then there 's a a much more uh uh refined test uh uh spectrography or whatever it 's called The chemo- chemotography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are

#s81
And uh

#s84
No

#s85
I I 've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now

#s88
And uh

#s89
No

#s90
And it and it and it has it has you know

#s91
they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody

#s92
And I uh at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you do n't you do n't know

#s93
But on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they 're going to have a test
