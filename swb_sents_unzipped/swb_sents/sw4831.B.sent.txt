Well since I 'm kind of on the the older side you know I I I just feel like uh when I start talking about benefits I talk about I 'm concerned about medical benefits

#s9
Uh my uh my husband works for McDonald Douglas

#s10
and so his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know

#s11
that 's really great

#s13
You know I work for uh Wes- a bank Western Financial

#s15
And uh they do n't let me know really about anything that 's going on

#s16
Even some of the immediate things that I need to know I do n't know it until the next hour

#s17
and all of a sudden we know we 've got changes made

#s18
We 're changing departments

#s19
We 're changing policies

#s20
We 're changing doing other kinds of things Which to me is is disturbing

#s21
I mean I feel like if I I do n't necessarily need to uh be involved since I 'm pretty much on a low level

#s22
you are you are right there

#s23
You know I 'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh the company is concerned

#s24
But I I do kind of like to know what 's going on and what 's happening

#s25
and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if if I had a little bit more information along that line

#s29
Oh my gosh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s40
Oh

#s42
And it it

#s47
Yeah

#s48
that is interesting

#s50
Exactly

#s56
A-

#s57
right

#s65
Uh-huh

#s68
Oh

#s70
I know

#s71
It it seems to be be kind of kind of scary you know Because you think of

#s72
uh see my son 's eighteen right now

#s73
and he he 's uh he wants to go into engineering

#s74
And the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open

#s75
and he 's interested in basically three different areas

#s76
But uh it 's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that

#s77
He needs to do his own course of investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what 's going to happen in another thirty years

#s80
And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical

#s81
I mean my uh brother-in-law is like uh I mean he 's sixty

#s82
He 's not ready to retire

#s83
but his company is is uh is uh closing up

#s85
And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on He 's getting cut back

#s86
and he 's not ready to retire
