Uh let 's see

#s2
How about uh let 's see about ten years ago

#s3
uh what do you think was different ten years ago from now

#s6
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s12
We

#s13
Well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short

#s15
Uh but I do agree that uh generally it 's society has sort of uh let 's see rushed everything ahead

#s17
And uh I do n't know

#s18
it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that

#s19
In other words they just prioritize their lives differently

#s20
But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation

#s24
Uh

#s25
Um It depends

#s26
Uh it 's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too

#s28
Uh I just

#s30
I 'm twenty-eight

#s34
Yeah

#s36
Yeah

#s38
I just I think that things were a bit were have been busy all along

#s39
It 's just a matter where priorities are at placed And that uh usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home

#s43
And now uh it 's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work

#s46
I think that 's part of it too

#s47
But I do think

#s50
No

#s51
no

#s52
I do n't

#s53
No

#s54
I do n't think that

#s55
But then there are a lot of people that that do n't have that But that really do need to work

#s58
I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive

#s59
And then there th- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that uh they think is is surviving which is really more luxuries

#s64
Uh but I I tend to think that it 's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive

#s67
I 'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living

#s69
Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing uh middle class in this country I think that that 's in my opinion the case

#s72
So

#s73
I mean I have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job

#s76
Uh-huh

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
Right
