#s1
Okay

#s2
Thanks

#s5
Well uh yeah

#s6
we we do

#s7
Um we 've been married for twenty-three years

#s9
and we have uh three teenage daughters

#s10
and you know they 're very expensive

#s11
So uh uh we yeah we have somewhat of uh a system

#s12
Uh it 's it 's kind of uh you know it 's kind of hard to explain

#s14
We 've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts

#s15
We always had just one

#s17
And now we are having two

#s18
Uh it 's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it 's very personal

#s21
So I have to be

#s22
That 's that 's kind of the way I feel about it

#s28
Yes

#s30
Do you have a two income family or one income

#s32
Yeah

#s34
Yeah

#s39
Uh-huh

#s41
Yeah

#s42
Yeah

#s47
So your wife

#s48
Yes

#s49
It

#s50
that

#s51
what

#s52
her is her career uh related to to finance or accounting

#s55
Oh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s61
Yeah

#s62
so that 's sort of related to her field a little bit

#s65
Yeah

#s71
Yeah

#s74
It 's just taking it out right

#s75
Right

#s76
Yeah

#s78
Yeah

#s79
We do the same thing

#s83
Yeah

#s84
if

#s86
you have something to take it out

#s87
That 's exactly what we 've always done

#s89
and we 've had uh they 've always had uh where they match your funds you know

#s90
sometimes if you if you save so much then they will match it

#s92
Uh that you know we 've done that too

#s93
But my husband works for an insurance company

#s95
and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years I guess

#s96
But he was with another company before that

#s97
but we have we have

#s98
I I work also

#s99
but I only have a part time job

#s101
and I get paid very little

#s102
but uh you know I try to use that money for food mo-

#s103
Jim gives me a certain amount money

#s104
You know we just transfer it into my account

#s107
and then I use that for food household expenses

#s108
and then I add my own check to that

#s109
and then with that I try and handle you know some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that

#s111
but the expenses that we need and have around the house

#s114
So

#s116
Yeah

#s117
Yeah

#s118
we

#s119
well Jim has Jim has a budget

#s120
I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down

#s122
Uh you know I am given so much mon- money a month

#s123
so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that

#s125
So I try not to you know

#s126
we do n't you know I do n't ask for more

#s127
I mean I just try and make it on that

#s130
Because I think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have

#s133
and uh you can you can really waste a lot of money that way

#s135
So uh well how long have you been married

#s138
Oh yeah

#s139
So you 're just really getting started

#s140
So do you have a family too

#s143
Oh yeah

#s144
Yeah

#s146
She has n't effected your budget yet really

#s149
No

#s150
Not like she will later on

#s152
You will see that all of a sudden you 're paying you 're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do

#s156
and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know

#s158
what can we do here

#s159
and then you have to really sit down and plan some more

#s160
and uh but I think when we were back at your age we did n't have much of a budget

#s162
and then as the girls got older I think we we did more and more of that

#s163
You know more budgeting as as they got older

#s165
Uh but uh but what do you do

#s166
Do you

#s168
Oh okay

#s170
Oh

#s171
Well good

#s173
Good

#s175
Well we just have you know we have a good friend that 's about to move to Atlanta

#s176
I guess we 're not suppose to talk about those things

#s177
I 'd better get back to the subject

#s179
But uh budgeting

#s180
I found you know I feel a lot better

#s181
You know we use to work out of one check book

#s183
and it would be very hard for me because I would n't have I would n't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month

#s185
Now I have know exactly what I 'm spending

#s186
and it 's so much easier
