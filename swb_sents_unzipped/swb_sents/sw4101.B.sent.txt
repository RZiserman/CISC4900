Hey Steve

#s3
Uh They just uh they just started a recycling program here I think

#s4
Actually this is my first experience with recycling program

#s5
but uh instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about uh I am starting to split stu- split stuff up

#s6
The only disadvantage is that they do n't pick it up at the curb

#s7
They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there

#s8
What are they doing up there

#s21
The the deposit 's only on like drink stuff

#s23
Okay

#s25
Okay

#s28
Oh okay

#s32
So did they

#s33
you 're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group

#s34
and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money

#s35
or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you

#s37
Oh Okay

#s42
That 's very cool

#s43
You know there 's a I heard about a similar program in New York City where uh a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that

#s44
but what they do is employ uh homeless I think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans

#s45
and and I think it 's mostly cans

#s46
There may be bottles as well

#s47
but like beer cans soda cans and what not

#s48
and they uh bring them up to a one lo- one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and get more money to these people that desperately need it

#s54
Yeah

#s58
Do they do it with news papers as well

#s65
Huh
