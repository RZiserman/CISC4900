#s3
Okay

#s4
All right

#s7
Uh-huh

#s11
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
I work for the University of New Hampshire

#s18
and uh our benefits package is n't uh is n't quite as good in some ways Uh you know

#s20
overall I 'm satisfied with it

#s21
We do n't have the vision care

#s22
we do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental

#s24
Uh

#s26
No

#s27
I work in I 'm a on the professional administrative and technical staff

#s28
and I effectively I run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire

#s31
Uh so the uh the benefits uh probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time

#s33
We get fifteen days a year sick time

#s34
and uh we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off

#s37
Yeah

#s42
Right

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

#s52
Well I think uh the the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit

#s54
and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know

#s56
I 'm I 'm a little disturbed about that

#s57
but I think that 's a national trend

#s58
and I do n't know that uh I do n't know what the solution is to it

#s59
It 's bigger than just the benefits part

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Right

#s67
Oh yeah

#s74
Uh-huh

#s87
Well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending

#s88
and and the cost between them is very is very little

#s89
I think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan

#s91
But it pays uh a substantial amount

#s92
I mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free

#s94
and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses

#s97
or

#s98
Uh yes

#s99
it is

#s100
The benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to

#s102
Uh-huh

#s103
but the main

#s104
I think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan

#s105
But the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued

#s108
Uh for the operating staff it 's on a seniority it 's you know based on how long they 've worked there

#s110
That determines how much uh vacation time they get

#s113
Uh-huh

#s116
Oh

#s121
College programs belong to this T I A A uh C R E F retirement fund

#s123
Right

#s124
and in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh
