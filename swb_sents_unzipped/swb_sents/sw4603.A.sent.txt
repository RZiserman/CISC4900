Uh well you know uh I think public service is a worthy thing

#s4
and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs uh such as Peace Corps that promote that

#s6
Probably the most popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts

#s8
Uh I know that f- because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his Eagle

#s9
and uh in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in uh citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world

#s11
and you have to do a public service project Uh in which leadership is the key element

#s13
I uh I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because uh it 's talking about a requirement for public service

#s15
and of course Pe- the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a is a voluntary activity

#s17
Uh

#s20
Right

#s21
of course uh uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service

#s24
And so uh one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal uh qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft

#s28
Uh

#s29
but I agree with you

#s30
that probably is not what was comprehended

#s31
There are other things such as civil service uh which many people uh are lifelong employees of

#s35
but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either

#s36
More of a voluntary kind of thing

#s38
or uh

#s43
Uh-huh

#s56
Why

#s58
Why is that

#s63
Oh no

#s64
no

#s65
no

#s66
It 's to defend the nation against external evils

#s70
Well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military
