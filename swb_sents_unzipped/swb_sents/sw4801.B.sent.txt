#s2
Well I 'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes

#s5
Well I think first degree murder uh probably warrants it

#s9
Right

#s11
Exactly

#s12
Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever

#s14
I come from a state that has well I originally come from the state that has uh the death penalty

#s15
I come from Florida

#s17
And uh they 're pretty liberal on it

#s18
They tend to like fry people left and right which

#s21
go ahead

#s25
Yeah

#s28
Yeah

#s29
okay

#s30
I think Florida still uses electric chair

#s32
Uh I do n't I do n't know

#s33
In some ways I do n't like it because it 's like they 're playing God

#s35
And that 's not

#s36
I do n't think that 's right

#s37
But on the other hand there 's a lot of advantages to it

#s39
I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it

#s40
and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not

#s41
Um

#s43
with Florida that 's a big problem because there 's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year

#s44
They

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
Sure

#s52
And it 's like you know that 's a big problem

#s53
but there 's not a whole lot you can do about it because there 's only so many jails you can build

#s55
and it 's really you know it 's it gets to be a r- a big problem

#s57
Uh go ahead

#s59
Right

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Yeah

#s64
Because a lot of these guys you know they get in

#s65
and they they get off for good behavior

#s66
and I do n't know

#s67
up in Minnesota where I am now they do n't have the death penalty

#s68
And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know Because they figure well you know sure I I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something

#s69
Uh but then for

#s70
if I if I elicit good behavior I 'm out in maybe five or ten

#s72
Oh sure you know

#s74
I mean just because like we said before they do n't have enough room in the jails uh you know there 's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early

#s77
But if you 've got the death penalty hanging over your head uh

#s78
I do n't know

#s79
I think that may solve a lot of that

#s81
Maybe not solve it

#s82
but I do n't know

#s83
maybe MUMBLEx

#s85
Yeah

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
What do you do Georgeanne

#s90
Oh okay

#s91
Great

#s92
What program you in

#s94
Okay

#s95
Fantastic

#s96
Uh

#s99
I 'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida

#s101
Yeah

#s102
I 'm doing an internship up at Honeywell

#s104
Uh yeah

#s106
But uh I do n't know

#s107
It 's it 's an interesting issue

#s108
There 's like you say in Texas there 's been quite a few

#s109
and and in Florida in the last few years I think there 's been a lot

#s110
I ca n't I know I ca n't give you figures

#s111
but uh

#s115
Uh-huh

#s118
Oh is that right

#s120
Okay

#s121
Yeah

#s122
I I kind of yeah I 've heard things about that

#s123
I 've heard that they do n't mess around very much

#s125
MUMBLEx

#s127
Uh-huh

#s133
Jeez

#s134
that 's a lot of repeals

#s137
Uh-huh

#s138
Yeah

#s139
I do n't know

#s140
I I 'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it

#s141
Uh I guess

#s142
what is it what 's the policy now with treason

#s143
Do they uh do they axe you for treason

#s144
or is it a life sentence

#s149
Yeah

#s151
Yeah
