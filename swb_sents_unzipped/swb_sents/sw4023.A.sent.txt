MUMBLEx how do you feel about crime in the city

#s2
You say you 're from Atlanta

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
I mean do you do you find crime in Atlanta really MUMBLEx

#s9
I live in Atlanta also

#s12
Uh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
Uh-huh

#s17
Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
I probably agree with that

#s24
Uh

#s26
Uh-huh

#s29
Yeah

#s30
that 's probably true

#s31
Um so um well do you think Atlanta 's as bad as most other cities

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s38
I do n't think it 's as bad as L A either

#s40
We I do n't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Yeah

#s50
I do n't know

#s51
I came to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where there 's a lot of crime a lot of that 's going to just just keeping your senses about you and and trying not to look like a victim you know

#s54
You know walk bi- you know walk with you know with MUMBLEx just walk in a confidently

#s57
and you know do n't do n't be looking around like you 've never been there before and you have no idea where you are

#s63
Yeah

#s65
Uh-huh

#s68
Uh

#s70
Yeah

#s71
MUMBLEx have you have you ever have you ever been mugged in Atlanta

#s74
Uh-huh

#s78
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
Uh-huh

#s84
Yeah

#s85
I 've been pretty lucky about getting mugged

#s86
Um Yeah

#s88
I think I 've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun

#s90
and that 's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that I 've seen in Atlanta

#s93
And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed

#s97
Oh really

#s99
Oh where was where where was that

#s100
Was that downtown

#s101

#s104
Really

#s107
Metropolitan

#s108
yeah

#s110
Yeah

#s111
I 've actually I 've known known some people that have had their cars stolen

#s112
Uh and uh and you know about half the time they seem to the A P D seems to recover them you know in various states of disrepair Up on blocks

#s115
My friend had a V W Rabbit

#s116
and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in the front seat

#s121
Uh-huh

#s123
Well you 're probably luckier than

#s126
Uh-huh

#s127
Um so like does insurance pay for the body damage

#s128
or was that all there was body

#s136
