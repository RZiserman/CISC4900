#s6
Yeah

#s7
Are you native to this area

#s11
Oh okay

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Yeah

#s18
Yeah

#s19
it seemed like

#s20
well you know last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in April

#s21
and this year we really did n't have heavy rains until May

#s22
Kind of like pushed the season back a little farther

#s23
and now it 's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity

#s24
and it just tried to rain

#s25
I mean I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago

#s26
and it was trying to rain which seems strange to have it raining in July

#s28
Normally we do n't have too much uh humidity or or uh rainy time when it 's past June

#s34
Right

#s38
Uh-huh

#s50
Well yeah

#s51
see I I lived in uh Ohio mainly

#s52
I lived in uh Pontiac just a little while before I came down here

#s54
and you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather

#s55
It might rain on your little parade

#s58
You know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime

#s59
and you really did n't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out

#s61
You could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do

#s63
What part of Michigan were you living in

#s65
Okay

#s66
Yeah

#s67
yeah

#s71
What brought you down here

#s73
So you teach in Plano schools

#s79
Oh

#s80
Okay

#s83
Okay

#s89
Well yeah

#s90
I think a lot of people were uh leaving Michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties

#s91
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus

#s93
You know the the little joke about will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light

#s96
Well you know I I said I lived in uh the Pontiac

#s97
I did n't live in the city of Pontiac

#s98
I lived to the west of it

#s99
Uh I forget the the county

#s100
but you know where all the lakes are around there

#s103
I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes

#s104
It was real close to where I worked

#s105
It was only like four miles to work

#s106
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that

#s107
You know in the summer you feel like you 're you know on a vacation all the time because you 're right on a lake

#s108
and everybody 's you know out enjoying the water and such

#s109
and uh in the winter time the lakes froze over

#s110
you could still kind of go sledding and such out there

#s111
but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes

#s112
There 's lots of really small ones out there

#s114
You know like maybe a mile two long

#s116
That 's enough to uh do some boating

#s118
and it was lots of fun

#s127
Yeah

#s128
yeah

#s129
But it was yeah just lots of little lakes

#s130
and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake

#s131
but I just thought that was grand

#s132
And I think a lot of people did n't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them

#s133
but there was quite a few lakes all around there

#s134
It seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island

#s135
there was so much water around where I was

#s136
I said I was n't close to downtown Pontiac

#s137
I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from from the city limits

#s138
and it was really nice out there

#s140
We had uh Pine Knob you know to go skiing and stuff

#s144
So there were things around there

#s145
Really was pretty nice

#s149
Right

#s150
right

#s151
in the summertime they have musicals there

#s152
and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope

#s158
Yeah

#s159
yeah

#s165
Uh-huh

#s169
Oh yeah

#s170
yeah

#s174
so

#s175
Yeah

#s176
yeah

#s177
We used to have a

#s178
Christmas time uh some of our relatives would come up from Alabama

#s179
and I think most times we would have snow around Christmas

#s180
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts

#s182
You know because they were from Alabama where it never snowed

#s184
and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally

#s189
My first winter here

#s190
I I came down in uh early eighty-two

#s191
and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be- couple days before Christmas

#s192
It lasted only a few hours

#s193
like by noon it was gone

#s196
And I remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow

#s197
And I was laughing going yeah right that 's a good practical joke

#s198
ha ha

#s199
They said no really there 's snow

#s200
and there was but a very short time

#s201
and the weather got warm so quick

#s203
it just melted it all away

#s207
Course when we get an ice storm that 's not too much fun

#s219
Oh yeah

#s220
I think it 's fun

#s221
even the couple of ice storms I 've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit

#s222
I mean sometimes the ice is pretty bad

#s223
but if you get on the the uh grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you know not slip and fall

#s224
I mean first
