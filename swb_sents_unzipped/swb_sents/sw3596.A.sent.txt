#s2
Oh yes

#s3
very appropriate I guess

#s4
Uh you ready for this

#s6
Okay John

#s7
just a moment

#s8
Well guess what

#s9
we get to talk about the weather

#s13
Uh-huh

#s18
Oh you do

#s20
so you you you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather

#s22
I imagine it 's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather

#s25
Well actually I 'm I 'm I 've heard on the news that we uh will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture we 've had this year that it 's going to break all kind of records that were set set set back since nineteen thirty-two

#s27
So yeah

#s29
If it keeps on raining like this

#s30
and I understand it 's supposed to rain until Saturday night

#s33
Oh yes

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Wow

#s42
And so are you an airline pilot

#s45
Oh great

#s48
For Southwest

#s49
fantastic

#s50
I have a brother I have a brother that 's a pilot also with American

#s52
Yeah

#s53
So I imagine you uh oh with all this kind of weather it uh makes it kind of dangerous for you

#s57
Oh I guess so

#s58
yeah

#s59
Yeah

#s62
Uh-huh

#s64
Oh yes

#s65
Well we moved actually down here from another location

#s66
and it 's spectacular the the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain

#s68
Pardon me

#s70
I 've never seen a thunder show like I 've seen down here before in Texas

#s72
Lights up the whole sky and even on a on a

#s73
actually I 've I 've seen it where there 's not a cloud in the sky

#s74
it 's a cloudless night

#s75
and the rain is n't falling

#s76
but you can see the thunder and excuse me see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth

#s77
and what a light show

#s81
It 's it 's fabulous

#s83
Yeah

#s84
that 's true

#s86
I 'm from uh northern Utah

#s87
and that 's a very arid climate

#s88
from uh Salt Lake City area

#s90
and there 's always a lot of snow

#s91
In fact where I grew up we were about an hour 's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts

#s92
and so there was an awful lot of snow

#s94
and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and and sleigh riding and everything else

#s97
So we had a great time

#s99
Um yeah

#s100
in uh in Snowbird and Solitude and and Brighton and yes all those areas

#s103
So I imagine have you skied before

#s106
Uh-huh

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
Oh yeah

#s113
MUMBLEx

#s114
Yeah

#s115
great

#s116
Well do you think this the the weather is typical for this time of the year

#s121
Yes

#s124
Yeah

#s125
it 's been it 's been cold

#s126
There was a time though in the uh middle part of November that got really cool really really unseasonably cool

#s130
and then it warmed right back up

#s131
and I thought great

#s133
and that 's that 's a fun th-

#s134
yeah

#s135
my wife was just listening here

#s136
and she said yeah

#s137
it froze in fact

#s142
And uh but uh I 've really enjoyed the weather down here too

#s143
because uh two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weat- weather

#s144
and it 's not as severe I should say as the weather that I 've experienced up in northern Utah

#s151
Down here

#s154
Not in Minnesota

#s159
I have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota

#s160
and they say boy six months out of the year it 's bitter cold

#s161
and and the wind and the blowing snow and everything
