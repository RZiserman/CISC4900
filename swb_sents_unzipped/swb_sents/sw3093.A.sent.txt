#s3
Someplace that 's very different than Texas

#s5
And I

#s6

#s14

we have plans this year to drive up to the uh to Colorado

#s20
And we will be going to Estes Park and Colorado Springs

#s21
so

#s23
One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado into Durango and north of the area there

#s25
And I

#s26
boy that 's a nice a nice place to visit

#s27
It 's really nice at

#s28
there 's a nice nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining

#s30
And uh and then actually north north of that is another town and a smaller on a smaller scale I guess than Silverton

#s31
But I and then there 's lots and lots of real of mountains that are covered with uh boulders

#s33
So I guess people Jeep through that area

#s34
and we did not have a chance to do that

#s35
But I sure would like to go back there and do that again

#s40
I have not been

#s41
