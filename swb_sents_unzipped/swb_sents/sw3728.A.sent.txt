#s5
Um no

#s6
I do n't watch much T V

#s7
Sometimes um usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news

#s10
But I do n't think of that every day even

#s12
Um I think I get most of my current events

#s13
well I get them from everywhere

#s14
I sometimes watch T V if I

#s15
I guess I watch T V if I have n't read the paper that day

#s16
We do n't get a paper

#s17
but I work um at a

#s18
I teach a college class

#s19
and uh

#s21
there 's a

#s22
the library has a paper

#s23
And so I often drop in on a break and and read it

#s25
And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I 'm home

#s27
And then I I figure if there 's big big news I 'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know

#s35
Uh-huh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s42
Yeah

#s43
what 's your favorite news

#s44
do you get a news magazine

#s45
or

#s49
Uh-huh

#s52
Yeah

#s53
Yeah

#s54

#s55
Uh-huh

#s56
Yeah

#s57
yeah

#s58
exactly

#s60
Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage

#s64
Yeah

#s65
it 's kind of hard to know

#s68
Uh-huh

#s74
Yeah

#s75
yeah

#s77
Well I do feel like a little bit like

#s78
being from California and wanting to hear like

#s79
I 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something

#s80
and

#s82
I do n't ever hear it in the news here

#s84
MUMBLEx

#s85
Um

#s89
Yeah

#s90
Yeah

#s92
Yeah

#s94
yeah

#s95
yeah

#s96
I sometimes feel like um the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS um the top headlines are always a murder you know

#s98
That that 's because there 's a high crime rate

#s99
Yeah

#s100
Yeah

#s102
Yeah

#s103
yeah

#s104
I 'm sure

#s108
Uh-huh

#s110
Yeah

#s111
really

#s113
That 's true

#s114
We certainly get enough coverage

#s115
I mean we we can get news you know

#s116
I mean there 's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day

#s122
Yeah

#s124
Yeah

#s125
often times

#s127
So Yeah

#s129
Well no

#s130
I guess we can end

#s132
Yeah

#s133
it 's just whenever we 're um

#s135
Yeah

#s136
Have you always gone until the recording

#s139
Uh-huh

#s140
I guess we 're not supposed to

#s143


#
Yeah

#s146
Uh-huh

#s150

Yeah

#s172
Uh-huh

#s174
Yeah

#s176
Yeah

#s177
Well I guess I can just say I it bothers me that I hear a lot about um you know on the news that

#s178
well it seems like I do n't know some things are sensationalized

#s179
or some things are um you know

#s180
you 'll hear one report

#s181
and then you 'll hear that it you know they did n't um
