#s2
I do n't really have a favorite type

#s3
I like uh a lot of different types of music

#s5
Yeah

#s6
I have a a tape collection that I like to listen to uh cassette tapes

#s8
but it 's pretty varied

#s10
Yeah

#s11
How about you

#s14
That 's exactly me

#s15
The acid rock or the heavy metal

#s17
Even some of that I like okay but not mostly as a general rule

#s19
I do n't care for that at all

#s23
Well as far as the rap goes I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves

#s26
and I like some of their songs

#s28
But as as

#s29
I agree

#s30
with the general rule I I would n't choose rap either

#s32
But I I like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz uh classical um

#s35
I I do n't

#s36
I like uh like I said pretty varied uh music

#s38
I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to like Billy Holiday

#s40
I really love to listen to her

#s42
and uh I even have a a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo

#s44
and well I mean they 're very harmonic

#s46
they really are

#s50
So they 're interesting to listen to

#s51
You might try that

#s52
How about you

#s58
Oh yeah

#s63
It 's too um uh

#s64
you have to concentrate on it it seems

#s66
What about the blues or something like that

#s73
Uh-huh

#s77
I I like some of it um

#s78
as far as like the cou- what they now call country western it does n't sound like the old country music at all does it

#s82
Um some of it sounds more like pop music

#s85
Oh n-

#s86
yeah

#s87
I do n't care for that

#s88
If I 'm going to listen to today 's country western I have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black

#s90
and I even liked Jim Reeves you know

#s98
or uh what what Merle Haggard and Faron Young

#s100
that type of country western is what I I like to listen to

#s102
Asleep At The Wheel Uh Sons of the Pioneers you know stuff like that

#s106
Um oh I like sound tracks a lot

#s108
Yeah

#s109
it seems like you get a lot of original music that way

#s112
I mean you know think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that 's just real recent

#s116
things like that I like to listen to

#s117
Um I like instrumental things

#s119
Um I have some Spiro Gyro tapes

#s121
Oh they 're wonderful

#s123
I love them

#s124
I have some dulcimer music

#s125
I mean like I said that that 's pretty varied

#s129
Al Jarreau he 's somebody I like

#s130
He 's pretty kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop too

#s135
Oh yeah

#s136
and you know what I like the most about him is I 've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he 's having fun

#s139
I mean some people sing

#s140
and they have their faced all contorted like it hurts them or something

#s141
But he looks like he 's having a good time

#s142
I mean he 's up there moving around and smiling like he 's happy and and like all he wants to do is is make the audience enjoy it too

#s145
And he he is real fun to listen to

#s147
Um Bonnie Rait I like her a lot

#s149
Um in fact whenever she won her big Grammy

#s151
I think it was like five of them or something

#s153
was was it five

#s154
or

#s158
Yeah

#s159
last year or the year before

#s160
I ca n't remember

#s161
but um I was listening to a particular radio station

#s162
and and the one D J said who the heck is Bonnie Rait

#s163
and why does she deserve five Grammies

#s164
Well I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that radio station any more if that D J can make such a unedu-
