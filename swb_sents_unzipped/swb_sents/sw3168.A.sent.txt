Okay

#s2
Uh well since I initiated the call I guess I 'll start off first

#s3
Uh number one I have absolutely no problem with random testing

#s4
Uh I spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job

#s5
and I feel I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and the such

#s6
I 'd feel much more comfortable than I do now based on what I 've been hearing in the newspapers

#s7
So I really do n't have a problem with it

#s20
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s28
Yeah

#s29
I well I happen to be

#s30
uh my job is I 'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world 's largest paint company

#s31
so I it 's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing

#s32
And even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs

#s33
and we at the present time do not have random testing

#s35
And I am pushing towards that

#s36
I I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide they should n't have a problem with it

#s38
And if they are trying to hide something then I have to know that because we 're t- we 're talking major liabilities

#s39
Not only with themselves but with other employees

#s41
And I really you know

#s42
they they 're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that I I would much much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested on a random basis

#s44
I I have a real fear but that at some point something 's going to happen

#s45
And they 're showing it with AIDS

#s46
so why you know

#s47
they sh- they ought to start doing something with the drugs

#s48
So I really have no problem with it

#s53
Uh-huh

#s56
Yes

#s62
Oh really

#s66
Well that scares me because if th- that 's the way they are

#s67
I

#s68
if I were a dentist I 'd want to be protected too

#s70
Uh-huh

#s76
Uh-huh

#s81
Right

#s83
Uh-huh

#s85
Well you where you 're located I I do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing

#s87
And I think they 've had it for several years

#s88
And their program they had I do n't think had a lot of uh problems associated with it

#s89
but uh my brother-in-law happens to work there

#s90
and it it sounded very positive

#s91
And I I think it 's great

#s92
I I would like I would encourage it

#s93
I 'm pushing our company towards that

#s94
MUMBLEx

#s96
Right

#s97
Exactly

#s99
Uh-huh

#s101
Right

#s104
Ours is changing

#s105
Yeah

#s106
ours ours is changing

#s107
it 's increasing

#s108
I live in a I live in a very nice suburb

#s109
and it 's it 's it 's unbelievable what what what 's going on and the drugs the selling of drugs

#s110
It 's just it 's just too loose

#s111
It 's too free

#s115
Uh-huh

#s118
Really
