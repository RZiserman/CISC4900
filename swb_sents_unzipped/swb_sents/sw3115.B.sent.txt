#s3
I 'm a I 'm a substitute teacher

#s5
Is is this Pat I 'm talking to now

#s9
Yeah

#s10
I 'm a substitute teacher in I believe the same school system we both work in

#s13
Oh okay

#s15
Oh

#s17
Well I bet you 're you 're you may dress differently then for that

#s25
Well What I wear sometimes depends on on how cold I think the school might be or what room I might be in since I 'm a sub and have different rooms to go to And always carry a sweater

#s28
Yes

#s30
No

#s31
you try to layer so you can add or or or take off

#s34
And it 's it 's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual uh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s47
Right

#s48
and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days

#s49
or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits

#s51
and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week

#s53
And one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat

#s55
No

#s56
but because I sort of stick to several schools uh I 'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it

#s59
And then many schools on a particular day during uh I guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which

#s63
Right

#s64
it might be Thursday for the high schools

#s65
and it may be Friday for the senior high schools

#s71
Yeah

#s81
Uh-huh

#s85
Yeah

#s86
it it

#s87
I see that the

#s88
I think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers I think

#s90
But it I think it varies it it just so much

#s91
Anything anything can go

#s93
And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they 're all pretty fancy

#s94
But they 're just sort of into clothes

#s95
and then there 's other departments that are n't

#s99
And they 'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might might say

#s102
Right

#s104
And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you 're going there

#s105
you do n't want to dress too tacky because you 're going to be in the same room with them

#s110
Or you 're going to be observed

#s111
Yeah

#s115
Right

#s116
They go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants

#s123
Yeah

#s124
well at Vines the coaches do n't do that

#s126
They they dress pretty good I would say

#s127
and then they go to their coaching

#s128
and they they put their shorts on there

#s131
Uh-huh

#s133
But they they do n't look you know they do n't wear their sweat pants or or anything

#s134
They 're they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in P E

#s137
Those I can understand

#s139
Yeah

#s146
I do n't think we 'll ever get to that

#s148
No

#s149
I do n't think

#s150
I think we 're going the opposite direction

#s151
It 's the parochial schools that I guess many ti-

#s152
they 've had uniforms for years

#s153
I r- do n't really know if they still do

#s156
It certainly makes it easier to dress

#s158
Uh-huh

#s159
Well it 's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run I think that you do n't have to be concerned about your wardrobe

#s165
Uh-huh

#s173
Yeah

#s174
but I doubt that that would come ab- that that will come about

#s176
Just

#s178
Yeah

#s179
I I

#s183
No

#s184
not

#s186
Yeah

#s188
Well I think it does

#s189
It it takes their minds off of of trying to compete

#s191
Uh-huh

#s194
Yeah

#s195
I I do n't think a lot of teachers are very professional

#s196
but
