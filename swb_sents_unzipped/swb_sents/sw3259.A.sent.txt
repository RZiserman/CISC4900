Okay

#s2
I 'll just go with you first

#s3
What kind of eating out do you enjoy

#s7
Right

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
Do you go like home cooking like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria

#s18
Me too

#s19
Uh-huh

#s20
Mexican

#s21
uh-huh

#s22
Uh we do too

#s23
We do the same

#s25
What are your favorite places

#s27
Uh-huh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s33
Oh yeah

#s34
Well we go we 've gone to August Moon

#s35
and we think that was real good

#s37
but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon

#s39
And those are excellent

#s40
They 're really a nice place you could take someone to eat

#s42
It 's not the the rinky Chinese decorations

#s44
but it 's a very elegant nice place to eat

#s46
We go very very often we go out for fajitas

#s47
That 's

#s48
my husband has just gotten stuck

#s50
And we go to On the Border And lots of places that have uh I think MUMBLEx

#s52
and some of those

#s53
and get fajitas

#s54
and he 'll just eat chips until we 've got three or four baskets coming back

#s56
And then uh last weekend we went out for Italian also

#s57
and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread

#s61
So we went to El Sorrento

#s65
It was fun

#s66
You know what

#s67
This is that 's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church

#s68
and Bob pointed to it

#s69
and he said I keep hearing good things about that place

#s70
we 're going to have to go

#s72
That 's what he

#s73
tha-

#s74
in fact you 're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that

#s76
So I guess we 'll have to do it

#s79
That 's what it that 's what

#s81
D MAGAZINE said that

#s82
It said there was always a line

#s84
But that 's probably I mean that 's a good that 's a good sign

#s87
Yes

#s88
we did

#s89
Now my kids did n't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna

#s91
and most of those things were a little more northern Italy

#s93
And they like just the traditional

#s94
They 're not very

#s96
Yes

#s97
they are

#s98
Exactly

#s99
Exactly

#s101
The place of the seventies

#s105
Uh-huh

#s106
Yeah

#s107
most kids do

#s109
W-

#s110
do you ever go for steak Just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing

#s113
Uh-huh

#s114
Yeah

#s116
Well I 'm I 'm real curious to try this one that has such MUMBLEx commercials The uh that Del Lincoln

#s117
and oh what is that guy 's name

#s118
They do those real corny commercials

#s120
It 's uh over there 's one over there in Addison

#s121
I ca n't remember his name

#s122
Anyhow it 's some

#s124
Yeah

#s125
it 's some famous steak place over in Addison

#s126
There 's a there 's a second one downtown

#s127
and they have these really corny radio commercials

#s129
but the- but their steak is supposed to be wonderful

#s130
So I ha- I had not tried that

#s131
My husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie

#s133
And it seems like I 've been

#s134
w- we found those one time

#s135
and then they discontinued

#s136
It was over in Addison

#s138
And then they uh closed up

#s140
So most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here

#s143
Uh-huh

#s145
Uh-huh

#s146
Well that 's exactly true

#s147
That 's right

#s148
That 's right

#s149
Yeah

#s150
That 's right

#s152
That 's e-

#s153
yeah

#s154
that 's right

#s155
Uh-huh

#s157
I had a friend who was taken to Lawry 's downtown for prime rib

#s159
and I have n't been

#s160
We usually do n't go for beef really anymore

#s162
Where

#s163
we 've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that 's that 's usually the way we 'll go if we 're not going lasagna

#s168
Uh-huh

#s170
Uh-huh

#s171
I know

#s172
Well I understand

#s174
That 's right

#s175
and save you some money too

#s177
Well

#s179
now what is your what 's your child 's favorite place to eat

#s183
Oh yeah

#s184
They 're easy

#s187
Yeah

#s189
Well mine enjoy that too

#s190
They like to go pretty much where we like to go

#s191
and they 'll

#s193
and then our favorite thing on Fridays we generally order pizza in

#s194
so not Pizza Inn but pizza to our house

#s198
So we 've done

#s199
Well um is there anything else you 'd like to discuss about it

#s202
I think we 've I think it 's come to an eye conclusion

#s203
so I 'll talk with you later

#s204
Thank you

#s207
Bye-bye
