#s6
Well they just kicked it off down here in in Sarasota county

#s8
Uh they had been doing it

#s9
they started first in Sarasota City Uh you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually

#s12
And uh they 've got these I do n't know what if you 're familiar with Sarasota county at all

#s15
They 've got these wh-

#s16
it 's it 's county wide program now

#s18
And what they 've done is they 've broken everything down into garbage Uh yard trash Plastic cr- cans and glass And then uh paper

#s22
Which in the paper it 's just uh newspaper and corrugated cardboard Is the only thing you 're supposed to put in there

#s25
No slicks Uh

#s29
Yeah

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Yeah

#s37
Yeah

#s40
Yeah

#s41
right

#s42
Well you know uh I talked to this girl

#s43
who uh she 's a an an acquaintance of mine

#s44
and and she 's involved with uh oh

#s45
what is the name of that company

#s46
It 's not Amway

#s47
but it 's the other big vitamin company

#s48
Shaklee

#s51
Okay

#s52
And uh and and she 's just Shaklee crazy you know because it 's her business and everything

#s53
And uh you know and she asked

#s54
we were talking one day

#s55
and and she asked me a couple of questions you know

#s56
And she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they do n't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything

#s58
Which that 's that 's what recycling at home sorting does you know

#s60
I mean it 's a little extra work

#s62
And uh it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in Sarasota county is they 've got

#s65
okay

#s66
you put your garbage in a garbage bag

#s67
and you set it out by the curb

#s69
If you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container

#s70
Uh or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and cer- certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb

#s73
Well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub

#s74
and it 's about a foot and a half deep

#s75
and it 's about one by one and a half foot wide and long

#s77
This is a little container

#s79
And then they have another one the same size

#s80
That one 's red

#s81
Then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods

#s83
And so like you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans

#s84
Otherwise you got bees and ants

#s85
and you know and and if you 've got uh food containers or anything like that it 's a big problem

#s88
So not only do you

#s89
yeah

#s94
Uh-huh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s98
This is true

#s100
This is true

#s105
Uh-huh

#s108
Yeah

#s109
they 've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here Uh if you want to have a nice garbage can you know

#s111
And it 's on wheels

#s112
and it 's big

#s114
Yeah

#s118
Yeah

#s121
I think in I think in the city they do

#s122
but out here in the county you have to rent them

#s124
And they just add it on to your water bill or something

#s127
East of Sarasota

#s129
Uh-huh

#s131
Yeah

#s134
Yeah

#s137
Yeah

#s138
About an hour About an hour south of Tampa

#s142
Uh yeah

#s143
well I listen to this talk radio station down here

#s144
and it 's really

#s145
th- they

#s146
I do n't if you ever listen to talk radio

#s147
but those guys they just kind of get into to s- s- stewing up trouble you know With the callers and things like that

#s150
But they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know

#s151
And some of it sometimes it 's serious

#s152
and they have some good feedback and all that stuff

#s153
and from listening to that I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with

#s155
and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program

#s156
the welfare program that 's going on right now

#s158
And it 's like uh
