Are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling

#s10
Well maybe they do n't

#s11
I I know that was supposed to be in May

#s12
and I could n't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were

#s19
Yeah

#s20
th- That 's going to be interesting because it 's uh we 've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is uh

#s21
I look at our big green containers

#s22
and I say well they work fine

#s23
and I keep mine outside the garage so that I do n't have any odors

#s24
but it 's clearly a place where uh uh

#s26
it will be interesting to see how well that works

#s27
and I am I 'm glad the community is doing it

#s28
Uh it 's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people

#s29
Uh I do n't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago

#s30
but for me the thing that strikes me is I uh growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that uh in the fifties uh you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now Which was all the milk bottles were glass

#s33
and you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them

#s34
Pop bottles all had a deposit on them

#s39
Oh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
Yeah

#s46
Yeah

#s48
So uh you know I look back at at uh my childhood

#s49
and I 'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now

#s50
and so it does n't bother me at all that we 're we 're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies

#s57
Yeah

#s60
Uh-huh

#s64
Yeah

#s65
well I 'll have to say I 'm I 'm the only one I 'm good at at this point is the newspaper Uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans uh getting rid of those

#s67
but on the plastic I have uh I do n't have any habits there yet

#s68
and I 'm guess I 'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction

#s69
but But it just seems like on the larger scale that you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things

#s72
and I think if uh if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect uh than

#s73
because I remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money

#s75
and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window

#s76
and so outside my little town we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something

#s80
Yeah

#s82
I

#s83
well that 's interesting because

#s84
they 're back to glass you 're saying

#s89
Uh-huh

#s90
Yeah

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
The carton The paper carton

#s97
Yeah

#s98
Well I mean the

#s99
you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing

#s100
and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty-four bottles

#s101
And and uh uh I 'm not really say going back to good old days

#s102
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now

#s106
Well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass I 'm I know your husband uh does n't really like the paper sacks

#s111
Yeah

#s112
I 'm the I 'm the same way because otherwise uh

#s113
oh I 'm I generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays

#s114
and Neal uh Neal 's a person who says I like to pick it up

#s115
but I do n't believe in throwing it into the uh the landfill

#s116
so I have my compost pile

#s117
but most of us do n't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh to do that

#s120
Uh so I 'm glad the city 's willing to take that on

#s124
Well there 's someplace you know

#s125
if it 's

#s126
because really when I look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty-four hours uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas

#s127
they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it

#s128
and it naturally uh composts or stores

#s129
and uh so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it

#s130
and it will naturally decompose uh

#s131
so you just have to kind of keep in separated

#s132
and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into

#s133
but it 's certainly usable material

#s137
Uh-huh

#s139
Right

#s140
But I the thing I do n't understand about that is like when

#s141
it 's one thing to send grass there

#s142
but I 've trimmed trees and other things which uh end up being something that clearly wo n't decompose nearly as rapidly
