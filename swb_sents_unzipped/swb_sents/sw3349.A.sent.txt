When I was growing up I was was into coin collecting

#s38

#s39
and then my hobbies in high school went just to the sports

#s40
Now my latest one is classic cars

#s41
I 've I had a sixty-six Mustang I was rebuilding

#s43
Almost had it done

#s44
and I went on went ahead and sold it

#s46
But it was fun

#s58
and and so I bought it

#s60
and they had uh some names some companies that sold mustang parts

#s61
and I just started ordering some parts

#s62
and and you know basically you know I what I did was I redid the whole interior

#s63
I did n't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good

#s64
but the the whole interior and then part of the exterior

#s65

#s67
