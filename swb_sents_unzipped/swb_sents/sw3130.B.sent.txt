Hi

#s2
good morning

#s4
Do you have recycling in Sachse

#s8
Do

#s11
Oh really

#s13
And it 's twice a week

#s15
Really

#s16
We have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh

#s17
used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up

#s18
And now they have uh these large green containers

#s19
and you have to put your trash that you do n't recycle in there

#s20
And then they have n't started curbside recycling yet

#s21
but they 're but they 're planning on doing it very soon

#s22
Apparently the trucks that they had um lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia

#s24
And so that put off the program for a while

#s25
But uh do you recycle

#s27
Do they

#s28
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s36
Oh well

#s38
that 's great

#s40
Well that 's the way we started too

#s41
My daughter was going to Camp Goddard um which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall couple of years ago

#s43
and she had to earn money for it

#s44
and she was too young to baby-sit

#s45
So that 's how she started

#s46
She started recycling cans

#s47
and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and uh aluminum cans and plastics

#s49
Uh-huh

#s50
Uh-huh

#s53
No

#s54
MUMBLEx the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans

#s56
Um the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling

#s57
And so you know we do n't get paid for that

#s58
but that 's okay

#s60
You know it 's it 's not that much of a bother really

#s61
You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever

#s62
and we use a lot of two liter bottles Um and like milk cartons and things like that

#s63
It 's amazing how much plastic you generate

#s66
Yeah

#s67
Yeah

#s70
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s73
it really is

#s74
Well all that stuff

#s75
and how much how much we have reduced our waste You know that we we 're generating a week

#s77
Um I know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there 's no way you know we 're going to have to have pickup twice a week

#s78
They were real upset

#s79
but they were n't they were only picking up once a week

#s80
And we said to them if you recycle MUMBLEx you 'll you know you 'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container

#s82
And uh it 's it 's really amazing

#s83
The other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we do n't collect our grass clippings

#s85
No

#s86
He he got a little mulcher thing

#s88
It 's just a little attachment for the lawn mower

#s89
and we mow once a week

#s90
You know no no more often then that

#s91
And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the uh the lawn

#s92
And it 's amazing

#s93
it 's amazing

#s94
We do n't collect any of that

#s95
and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out

#s99
Uh-huh

#s102
Yeah

#s104
Yeah

#s106
Sure it does

#s107
Sure it does

#s108
It really does

#s109
and it

#s110
actually they say that you 're wasting fertilizer if you 're not uh if you 're catching your grass clippings

#s112
That that 's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn

#s113
It 's amazing

#s115
Yeah

#s116
Yeah

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
that 's true

#s123
That 's true

#s124
That 's true

#s125
Well I I really think you 're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it

#s127
It 's it 's really not that much trouble

#s128
We keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage

#s130
And as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there

#s131
and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near Wal-Mart

#s133
They 're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in

#s134
and it 's really no trouble

#s135
And uh I feel like at least we 're doing something

#s137
You know MUMBLEx um I read a book one time or a m- a magazine article

#s138
and they said something about how you do n't realize even just your small contribution

#s139
it seems like a small contribution

#s140
but it 's not

#s141
If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would s- save thousands and thousands of trees a day A day just from not throwing out your newspapers

#s143
And uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know

#s145
Uh-huh

#s146
Uh-huh

#s148
Yes

#s149
Yeah

#s153
Yeah

#s154
yeah

#s155
yeah

#s156
And that 's and that 's really not necessary

#s158
It really is n't

#s159
if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference

#s160
It would make a huge impact

#s161
So I 'm excited about the recycling program in Plano

#s162
I I ca n't wait for them to get it started Um because it 'll be that much easier for us

#s163
you know like I said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart

#s164
It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up

#s167
Um

#s168
Now what what do they pick up

#s169
It 's just

#s171
Oh they do

#s173
Uh-huh

#s174
And do you have to sort that

#s176
Or do you just put it all in

#s182
Right

#s183
Right

#s186
So you 're doing that now

#s187
You 're doing the newspapers and the glass

#s190
Oh uh-huh

#s191
Uh-huh

#s192
Uh-huh

#s195
Uh-huh

#s196
My husband would come home and go through the trash and say you threw this away

#s198
He would get he would get all upset

#s199
and I 'd say

#s200
it 's just such an automatic reaction

#s201
And now we think before we throw anything away

#s203
I mean it 's really funny

#s204
We we really

#s205
once you get into the habit of it it 's okay

#s206
it 's just it 's just making it a habit that 's hard

#s214
Uh-huh

#s216
Uh-huh

#s220
Uh-huh

#s221
That 's fun

#s222
Yeah

#s223
yeah

#s225
yeah

#s226
Oh that 's a lot of fun

#s228
That 's a lot of fun

#s229
Well that 's great

#s230
Well I 'm to hear you 're doing that

#s231
I

#s232
my sister was here recently from Connecticut

#s233
and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans
