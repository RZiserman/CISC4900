#s3
Well uh I do n't know that we really have a budget

#s4
I have a set amount that I that I save

#s5
Actually well actually there is a a way budget our money apparently

#s6
The

#s7
uh my wife uh has so much uh gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks

#s8
and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that

#s9
and besides that I uh you know I have a set amount that I save every month

#s12
Uh-huh

#s16
Uh-huh

#s18
Really do n't need to

#s23
That 's right

#s25
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s30
Right

#s31
Well I found that uh you know things as I have gotten older

#s32
I am in my fifties now

#s33
but before we use to have to have to have a very strict budget

#s34
I had four kids

#s35
and uh you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that

#s36
Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be

#s37
Uh I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside uh I kind of fence off areas of my check book

#s38
For instance there are certain things that I know come up uh every so often

#s39
Every six months I have to pay car insurance

#s40
Uh every six months I have to pay my taxes

#s41
So I take a set amount

#s43
I 've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh uh saving in

#s44
and I also have got a checking account besides that

#s45
but what I do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month I will just take two hundred and twenty out

#s46
and I put it in parenthesis

#s47
I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up

#s49
Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it

#s50
Then when the tax bill comes in I 've got that much set aside

#s52
And I guess that 's a way of budgeting

#s59
Uh-huh

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Yeah

#s64
Uh cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget Not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too

#s66
Uh you know we 've got two cars

#s67
My wife has a car

#s68
and I like to drive pick up truck

#s69
So we are on a schedule where I try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one

#s70
And you know I am constantly making car payments

#s71
but I figure that 's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments

#s73
So uh you know I get one paid for

#s74
and uh actually I am saving up for another one besides

#s75
so it 's you know it 's kind of a never ending thing

#s78
but you try to you try to schedule those things so that uh you only you 're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying

#s81
Well uh I have thought about it

#s82
but leasing would n't you know

#s83
I do n't use it for my business

#s85
My wife uses hers just for pleasure

#s86
and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away

#s88
so

#s90
Yeah

#s91
I guess

#s92
Uh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s96
Right

#s97
Yeah

#s98
you 're right

#s99
Uh I have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years

#s100
but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill

#s101
and you got to put put stuff in them you know

#s107
Uh-huh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
Those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in

#s115
Uh you know it 's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say So that it does n't uh kill you all in one month
