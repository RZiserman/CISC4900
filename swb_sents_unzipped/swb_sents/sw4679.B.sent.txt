Okay

#s3
Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement

#s4
Uh trial by jury is good

#s5
but a lot of time i- a lot of cases uh is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which I do n't think is all the time good Because sometimes it 's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent I mean prove a person guilty if you do n't really know or you do n't really have an eyewitness

#s6
And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me

#s7
I do n't know

#s9
I think so

#s12
Uh-huh

#s16
Right

#s21
Uh-huh

#s26
You think you prefer the jury

#s27
You think your chances are better

#s32
Well that 's true

#s37
Uh-huh

#s40
Well s- sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair

#s41
I mean even if well the jury I guess they do decide that

#s42
but but I 'm like you

#s43
in a case like that most of the time its

#s44
I do n't know

#s45
maybe I 'm too too uh uh conservative when it comes to that

#s46
Th- the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know

#s47
uh

#s51
Right

#s53
Yeah

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Right

#s61
Oh really

#s64
Yeah

#s65
That 's that 's not a bad system

#s66
But I I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit

#s68
But the thing is too maybe they need more of a I do n't know more of a expert types to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an- and call them in

#s72

exactly

#s75
Right

#s76
exactly

#s78
Yeah

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
Put- putting on a act or whatever

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
Exactly

#s85
exactly
