#s2
Um I do

#s4
What what do you think about them

#s6
Yeah

#s7
definitely

#s8
I have one right now

#s9
and um I just got it about eight six months ago

#s11
and I find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally would n't get

#s17
Yeah

#s19
Oh my goodness

#s24
Really

#s26
That 's good

#s27
D-

#s28
yeah

#s29
I I made a rule with myself when I got one that if I could n't pay it in full every month that I 'd have to rip it up

#s30
so

#s34
That 's

#s36
Yeah

#s37
but

#s44
Uh-huh

#s45
I have I have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out

#s46
And they they ca n't do anything but work to try to pay them off

#s48
And and and like one of my friends she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars

#s49
and she do- she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she 's going to school

#s51
And and so I mean that 's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty-five dollars worth of food a month So and and pay for her like like monthly fee like twen-

#s52
yo- I guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the

#s55
so all she 's paying is interest on hers every month

#s57
It just seems crazy to to me

#s58
but

#s64
Yeah

#s71
Oh really

#s73
Was a Visa card

#s75
Oh my goodness

#s77
I bet

#s79
Yeah

#s80
I I do n't know

#s81
I 'm about sick of mine right now

#s82
I do n't

#s84
Uh-huh

#s90
Right

#s94
Exactly

#s96
Yeah

#s97
my parents are really good about not using credit cards

#s98
They are against it

#s100
I do n't think they like the fact that I have one either

#s102
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s108
Huh

#s114
Yeah

#s115
I 'm nine- I 'm twenty right now

#s118
So just going to school and and working

#s119
so

#s121
it does kind of get in the

#s122
when you want something that

#s123
like last weekend was homecoming

#s124
and I needed a pair of shoes

#s126
so I just went out and bought them and on my credit card

#s128
I did n't really have the money to do it

#s129
but

#s132
Yeah

#s133
It sure is

#s134
So do you just have two kids

#s135
or

#s137
Oh really

#s139
Neat

#s140

#s142
But right now I 'm out in Provo Utah going to B Y U

#s143

#s149
