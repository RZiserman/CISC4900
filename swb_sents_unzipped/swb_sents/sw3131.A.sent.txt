#s3
Well not so much personally

#s4
but my um husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother I mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such

#s5
They live down in College Station where his parents do too

#s6
And they put her in a home last year

#s8
She appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own

#s10
So they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year

#s12
Uh yeah

#s13
although she is uh in pretty good health and she 's does n't take any medication

#s14
it 's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point

#s16
Then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she 's in the car

#s18
Uh

#s23
Well yeah

#s24
when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the

#s25
I mean it was n't a very um strong stroke

#s26
It was just kind of all of a sudden she was n't herself anymore

#s28
And she got kind of fearful of being on her own

#s29
She never really ate very well

#s30
It was one thing

#s31
She hardly ever took care of herself

#s33
and she did n't eat

#s34
She ate very poor

#s35
so I think she was you know

#s36
bad uh nutrition on top of it

#s37
And uh she got to the point she did n't want to alone anymore

#s38
So

#s42
Um

#s44
Well she was almost ridiculous

#s45
Like she 'd eat ice cream and cookies

#s46
She 'd

#s49
Did n't one

#s51
Oh really

#s54
Well she did n't want to cook for herself anymore

#s56
Oh that 's too much trouble

#s57
That 's too much trouble

#s58
Did n't want to cook

#s62
Yeah

#s64
Although they 've got uh Meals On Wheels Which I understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat

#s69
No

#s70
I do n't think there was Um

#s71
I know a little bit more from a a co-worker

#s72
Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in

#s74
Um she was ambulatory

#s75
and so there was a lesser care

#s76
Uh then she got uh uh hip broken

#s77
and then uh she was n't as ambulatory

#s78
so they were almost you know to the point of saying she ca n't be here anymore

#s80
But I remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington something like that

#s82
And uh you know the type of facilities whether it 's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom

#s83
All of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items

#s86
They 're always saying that somebody 's going to

#s87
and some of them I think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half seni-

#s90
Uh So they they uh do n't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items

#s91
Very limited space waste

#s93
but um at least they all seem to have uh you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities

#s94
you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals

#s96
I know when my friend 's mother-in-law first went in

#s97
I mean very antisocial

#s98
Maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well I 'll be with other people

#s99
but

#s101
Yeah

#s102
I do n't understand that they they do n't want to be with anybody else

#s108
Uh-huh

#s110
Uh-huh

#s115
Yeah

#s116
I have a um

#s117
my aunt 's mother is uh gotten ill recently

#s118
and uh she lives in Pennsylvania

#s119
they live in Alabama

#s120
And they 're saying hey we need you to be closer

#s121
and you have women like that

#s123
I do n't to men

#s124
it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly

#s125
that whole I mean

#s127
they do n't get out of the house

#s128
they do n't socialize

#s129
but it 's my home

#s130
and I do n't want to leave it

#s132
Uh

#s135
Um

#s140
But it 's it 's so lonely

#s141
you know they ca n't get out and see anyone

#s142
and I mean it 's hard for for someone like me to understand that

#s144
because I th- I think what do you have there

#s145
It 's a house

#s147
it 's walls

#s148
and it 's furniture

#s149
but there 's nobody there

#s151
Do n't you want to be close to me I mean you know be with other people

#s153
I just do n't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building

#s156
And there 's no family there

#s157
they do n't get to see their grandkids

#s158
they do n't get to see their children

#s159
they just there in that house

#s162
Yeah

#s165
That 's from the child 's standpoint

#s166
The child is going why do n't you want to be close to me and your other family

#s168
What does that house got attraction

#s170
I know they 're really proud of independence

#s172
Uh

#s181
Well when she got home who took care of her

#s184
Oh

#s188
Uh-huh

#s190
Um

#s195
Yeah

#s196
my husband and I we have been thinking about

#s197
his folks are in College Station

#s198
and we 've pretty much planned that we 'll be here in the Dallas area

#s199
and there 's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they 're retired

#s201
So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here
