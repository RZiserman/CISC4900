Now we 're ready

#s2
Do you have a personal computer

#s4
You do in your home

#s7
I do not have one in my home

#s8
I use one all day at work

#s9
but I do n't have one at home

#s11
Do you find you use it a lot

#s16
Uh-huh

#s17
uh-huh

#s18
What kind do you have

#s21
Uh-huh

#s22
Uh-huh

#s23
Well that sounds interesting

#s26
I have a a P S one I B M type

#s28
Uh and I use it all day at work

#s29
and I put all my personal stuff on it at work

#s31
So I really do n't have n't had a need for one at home

#s32
but probably if I did n't have access to one all the time at work I 'd want one at home

#s35
Uh-huh

#s36
Yeah

#s38
What is that

#s39
tracing tracking the flights and things

#s42
Uh

#s44
They tell us when we 're through

#s48
They come in and tell us

#s49
Have you just started doing this

#s50
Oh really

#s52
They 'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it 's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that

#s54
It 's not more than five min-

#s56
But I 'm going to ignore that

#s57
That 's a call on my other line

#s58
so I 'm just going to ignore it

#s60
But

#s63
It 's kind of a hassle when you have this

#s64
but other times it

#s66
I work at Texas Instruments

#s68
Yes

#s70
I sure do

#s73
Well no

#s74
I 'm doing this at home

#s75
I 'm already home for the day

#s78
I do it you know I ca n't do it at work

#s79
I I 'm I work in the legal department

#s80
so I 'm pretty busy

#s82
But I use my P C there mostly for creating legal documents

#s83
We use Word Perfect Lotus

#s85
Uh

#s89
Yeah

#s90
it 's really

#s91
I love Lotus

#s93
I think that 's about my favorite

#s95
Uh-huh

#s97
It really is

#s98
and I know there 's still a hundred things I do n't know how to do on it

#s100
But uh you know you learn something every time you use it

#s103
Uh-huh

#s106
You can

#s107
did they give you a number to call

#s110
You can start calling in whenever it 's convenient for you

#s111
but you can only make one call a day

#s113
Yeah

#s114
if you 've talked to someone like you 're talking to me now and I place the call this counts as your call

#s117
So you can not make a call now until tomorrow

#s122
No

#s123
we both do

#s126
Did n't they ask you for your I D number when you answered

#s129
Okay

#s130
so you both do

#s132
From what I understand

#s134
It 's for research

#s136
It 's a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know

#s139
To uh

#s140
it 's uh

#s142
well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up

#s143
Uh-huh

#s144
Uh-huh

#s145
They 're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on this

#s146
Now I do n't know I do n't know everything about it

#s148
but they uh try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this

#s149
and that way they can check voice patterns

#s152
Uh-huh

#s153
and get the computer where it recognizes voices

#s156
Well I probably do because I 've

#s161
Well I 've been b- I was born and raised in Texas Have lived here forever

#s162
so I probably do

#s164
I 'm in Richardson

#s165
It 's right outside of Dallas

#s168
Uh-huh

#s170
Well Richardson 's right between Dallas and Plano

#s173
You probably did

#s175
Uh-huh

#s177
Well what are you doing way in Washington

#s181
Uh-huh

#s182
Well that 's interesting

#s185
Uh-huh

#s186
So I imagine they use personal computers

#s189
Do they do their correspondence on it

#s191
Uh-huh

#s194
Uh-huh
