Well this is an unusual topic

#s2
What do you think about it

#s12
Well that sounds great Ellen

#s13
How far away do they come from

#s18
Oh okay

#s23
Oh okay

#s24
that makes sense

#s25
Nobody 's out of a lot of trouble more than once

#s30
Uh-huh

#s32
Yeah

#s33
That 's interesting

#s34
You sound like you 've had a lot of experience with this then

#s40
Southern California 's still pretty large

#s44
I see

#s45
MUMBLEx

#s46
Yeah

#s47
well my experience uh has been limited pretty much lately to my mother 's side of the family

#s49
Uh years ago there was a big dispute on my dad 's side

#s50
and uh they have n't had a reunion since then

#s51
They just show up at funerals and weddings

#s53
It was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that

#s55
but anyway my mother 's side we had our our first real reunion that I 've ever gone to last summer

#s56
and they had people come in from out of town

#s57
and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn

#s58
and uh they had some activity

#s59
they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff

#s60
and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree

#s61
and you know a lot of that sort of thing

#s62
Since it was the first one that we 'd had that you could do that once

#s63
Now next time we have one we 'll have to think of something more creative to do

#s70
Oh

#s72
Well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy

#s74
Not a passion huh

#s75
Uh I suspect we 'll do quite a bit more genealogy

#s76
and I I suspect we will do more of it

#s77
Uh I found out some about some of the relatives

#s78
I did n't you know I I did n't even know their names some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles

#s80
and uh there 's a lot of things there you have to stop

#s81
they 're really kind of fascinating

#s82
I found out my grandmother was one of a twin

#s84
And we do n't even know where the twin

#s85
we have virtually no no background on on her on the twin

#s89
My grandmother 's uh sister who would be somewhere in in West Virginia

#s90
I 'm sure she 's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago

#s93
I 'm I 'm quite a bit I 'm probably a lot older than you are

#s94
Uh

#s96
I do n't know
