#s3
Well I think they 're they 're having a lot of trouble right now

#s4
I know my son goes to a private school

#s5
but uh I think they 're big city public schools by definition are having a a tough time right now just from uh probably from budget cuts and and everything else going on

#s7
Well I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school

#s8
so he 's he has been going to private since kindergarten

#s11
So

#s13
Oh he 's loved it

#s14
He is a senior in high school this year

#s15
so he 's

#s17
Yeah

#s18
he 's done it the whole twelve and uh so many years

#s19
and it 's been uh it 's been really good for him

#s21
Uh overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades uh about four hundred and something

#s22
so it 's maybe a hundred per grade

#s24
Yeah

#s25
it really is

#s29
Yeah

#s30
that was we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture

#s31
and he 's done he 's done really well

#s34
and just he was just ahead at an early age

#s35
and I did n't feel like uh in what was available particularly in the first three grades

#s37
and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program

#s39
And I just did n't think that was going get it

#s40
I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead uh every day But yet still be with his peers age wise

#s47
You 're just getting started

#s52
Yeah

#s53
I know

#s54
That 's a big problem

#s57
We would n't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school

#s61
Would n't have thought of it

#s62
and and they 'll stand there now with them toe to toe

#s65
and

#s70
Yeah

#s71
but a lot of times it 's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for for elders and adults and particularly in in responsible positions

#s72
have not uh I do n't think have had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases

#s76
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands

#s80
I guess I

#s81
Well the world changes

#s82
so I mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be

#s84
I mean they 're exposed to a whole lot more things

#s85
They have a whole lot more uh variety of things they they 're that they see and do at an earlier age

#s86
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time

#s87
but but still I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to to teach uh basic values and basic uh respectful of uh -ness of authority

#s89
And I just do n't think that this does n't always get emphasized anymore uh

#s94
Yeah

#s95
had to wear dresses did n't you

#s101
And when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor

#s102
and we hold the ruler up here

#s104
and it 's no more than so many inches above the knee

#s107
Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time

#s114
Yeah

#s115
I think that probably does have have something to do with it

#s116
and it 's also

#s119
No

#s120
they do not do uniforms although one where he was between like second and eighth grade did
