#s1
You want to go first

#s4
Okay

#s5
Uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we d- wh- what do we think about a judge making the decision

#s7
And I really do n't agree with that

#s8
I think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than e- having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible

#s9
I do n't think that they could be objective in every case every time

#s11
Yo- you know what I mean

#s14
Yeah

#s17
Right

#s19
That 's it

#s22
Well I I feel the other thing too uh

#s23
they were saying uh you know what new ways could y- could it you you know change the system

#s24
I I really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal

#s25
I mean i- if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed If they have been caught you know point blank in the crime There 's uh no question

#s27
it 's beyond a reasonable doubt

#s28
You know all these things

#s29
I mean you know we 've gone through this over and over again

#s32
And it can go on for ten twenty years

#s34
I I think this is a little ridiculous

#s36
I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers

#s39
I I 'm serious

#s40
And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha- that exist in the s- in the criminal system today With plea bargaining

#s42
You know if someone is

#s44
Well

#s47
Well I know

#s48
That 's MUMBLEx what I 'm saying

#s49
But I think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard

#s50
I mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they

#s51
I do n't know how it works exactly

#s52
but you know they get lesser sentences

#s54
and I understand that the jails are full of people you know uh and that they have to do something

#s56
But I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it

#s58
Yo- you know what I 'm saying

#s59
That w- we do n't have uh well a lot of states do n't have capital punishment

#s61
And uh I I think they should

#s63
I and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone 's life and like you say it 's it 's there 's no doubt whatsoever Like drunk drivers that kill people

#s64
and uh you know all

#s66
they they 're caught dead to rights

#s67
I I just think that that 's they 've they 've taken a life

#s68
and if they should pay for it with their life

#s71
Yeah

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Oh really

#s79
It uh

#s80
Yeah

#s83
I know that that

#s84
Uh-huh

#s85
And I do n't know

#s86
Uh what would you do to change it To make it better

#s92
Oh yeah

#s93
I I I do n't agree with that at all

#s95
Imagine the guilt that person would have

#s96
I mean MUMBLEx burned out

#s98
There 's there 's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself

#s101
If you had to do something like that day after day

#s103
No

#s104
Not really

#s106
Well w- do you think people should have a trial is they 're caught dead to rights like

#s110
I mean supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you

#s112
In other words you 're saying that w- you have to find out whether it 's premeditated or what the circumstances were

#s116
Yeah

#s118
Yeah

#s120
Well I I
