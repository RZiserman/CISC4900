#s3
Oh really

#s5
Huh

#s6
So you went to what college

#s8
And what did you graduate in

#s11
Yeah

#s12
major

#s14
Oh really

#s17
I 'm going to B Y U

#s18
and I 'm going into nursing

#s20
so

#s23
Forever

#s24
Seems like anyways

#s25
It 's about five years

#s26
but it 's probably going to take me longer because I did n't decide to major in that until uh about a year and a half after I was already in school

#s27
so

#s30
Oh really

#s31
That sounds

#s33
Yeah

#s39
Yeah

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
So what is your advice to picking a college

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Is that what was yours more like

#s49
there a

#s51
Really

#s53
Oh that 's great

#s59
Uh-huh

#s66
Wow in high school

#s68
Oh

#s70
Wow

#s75
Uh-huh

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
Yeah

#s83
there 's it 's

#s84
the classes here are pretty big

#s85
so it 's hard to get individual help

#s86
It 's kind of you 're on your own

#s89
No

#s90
Very little I mean

#s91
well like my

#s92
for example I have I 'm in a chemistry class right now

#s94
and there 's tons of students in it

#s95
and there 's one T A for the whole class

#s96
And he only has certain office hours

#s97
and so there 's only certain times you can talk to him

#s98
and

#s102
Right

#s103
yeah

#s105
Oh man

#s106
I think your advice is good

#s107
Um let 's see

#s108
My advice would be to pick a major before you get into college

#s110
because I I did n't

#s111
and I took tons of classes that I did n't need to

#s112
and um I do n't know

#s113
I just feel like I 'm it 's it 's going to take me a lot longer than

#s114
and not that 's always bad

#s115
but it 's

#s116
I do n't know

#s117
it 's frustrating I guess

#s120
Right

#s123
Yep
