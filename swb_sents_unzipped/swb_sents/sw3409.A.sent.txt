#s2
Um I think I 'm down to one

#s6
Well no

#s7
I was pulling your leg

#s12
I I

#s13
well

#s14
the way I 'd like to try and use it is um you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time

#s16
and then you pay that off and do n't use it until uh it 's paid off

#s18
That 's that 's my ideal way

#s21
Emergencies come along

#s22
and I and I use it

#s26
Uh like uh my car uh had a major problem

#s27
and

#s28
seven hundred dollars

#s30
and uh things just come up

#s33
and you just never get to use it the way you 'd really like to

#s42
Uh-huh

#s46
Um

#s48
Yeah

#s50
Yeah

#s51
Well I I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards

#s52
and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble

#s54
so we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it

#s56
I just

#s59
Yeah

#s61
MUMBLEx

#s64
Yeah

#s65
yeah

#s67
Well now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there

#s71
Our our only credit card is Sears

#s72
so and I have that for automotive purposes

#s79
Yeah

#s80
Yeah

#s81
it 's it 's just too easy basically uh just get yourself in trouble with those

#s87
I see

#s92
Yeah

#s94
Uh I would n't mind uh you know getting back into one if they would you know

#s95
you start out at a low limit

#s96
and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit

#s98
and and if I can get one that 'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that then that 's fine

#s101
but they eventually gets up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand

#s104
forget it

#s105
I do n't want that

#s107
Yeah

#s109
So I do n't know

#s110
just uh writing checks is just as easy I guess

#s115
Yeah

#s116
well really

#s117
what what can you

#s120
Other than you use them or you do n't use them You like them or you do n't like them

#s121
So

#s123
I guess uh they do n't care if we end it early

#s124
So uh hopefully uh you have a good Thanksgiving

#s125
That 's coming up

#s126
and And then uh maybe we 'll talk again

#s132
Yeah

#s134
Texas is the big one

#s137
Okay then

#s138
Well bye now
