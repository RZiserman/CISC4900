Think about uh taxes

#s5
You spend what you have

#s6
and

#s7
Yeah

#s8
I think that the general idea is to s- you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy

#s9
but they 're running under the assump-

#s10
you know the way they 're running it now they 're h- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we 're not under a recession

#s11
so there 's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we 're running

#s12
so that 's kind of a basic thing of economics I guess keep spending keep going into debt

#s13
you 're not going to payoff what you owe

#s14
but so I guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay f- you know get what you pay for

#s20
Yeah

#s21
There 's

#s24
Uh-huh

#s25
I agree with that

#s27
I guess

#s28
I 'm I 'm a student right now

#s29
and I do n't make a whole lot of money

#s30
and so I I kind of do n't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to I guess uh compared to what I get because I you know all my my education is state sponsored

#s31
I go to a state sponsored school

#s32
and uh my education all up through high school and stuff

#s33
so I guess I 'm kind of in debt I I suppose because I do n't you know been paying taxes all that all that long

#s34
My parents I guess h- h- however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything

#s35
but uh I usually end up getting money back

#s36
I will this year anyway from a

#s38
Yeah

#s39
I am

#s40
I need it too

#s41
otherwise

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

#s51
More taxes you pay

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
Is n't

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
Uh-huh

#s61
Wow

#s63
Uh-huh

#s64
Well is n't

#s66
Uh-huh

#s67
there 's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70
The taxes that people do n't think about that

#s71
yeah

#s72
the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay I guess

#s74
Uh-huh

#s75
There was that

#s76
which can-

#s77
was it Jerry Brown

#s78
one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a f- I think a flat percentage something like that

#s82
Uh-huh

#s85
Right

#s86
Exactly

#s87
That 's because until like eight

#s91
Up until like eighty-five or something was the
