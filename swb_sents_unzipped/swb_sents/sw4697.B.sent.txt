#s5
Right

#s6
I I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases uh the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed

#s8
Uh I I think that in some cases that 's considered to prejudice the current case

#s10
so a judge you 're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there

#s12
and if they 're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri- position to give an appropriate uh sentencing

#s22
Uh-huh

#s27
In other words not not

#s28
there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed a jury trial

#s32
I I I do n't

#s33
th- there 's a point on which we do n't agree

#s35
I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a one of the parties wants one

#s37
And I usually it is the defendant I guess that wants to have the jury hear the case

#s39
So I 'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know

#s40
that would require a change in the Bill of Rights I believe

#s41
and so

#s44
Oh

#s45
oh okay

#s56
Right

#s57
Well I think that 's all ready possible

#s59
I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial

#s60
uh

#s61
yeah

#s64
so I agree that that should be encouraged

#s66
People should know that that 's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial

#s67
But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into per- giving a different sentence or possibly if it 's a civil case giving higher uh you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award

#s73
Yeah

#s74
And I suspect it in cases like

#s75
I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil

#s76
Is that right

#s78
Yeah

#s80
Well uh in the case of civil uh things I think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer 's advantage

#s81
and I think that may be where jury use is overdone

#s82
I mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently

#s85
But the lawyers are really uh

#s86
it 's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible

#s88
so Uh I was wondering too if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in in a criminal cases

#s91
Uh I 'm not so sure I 'm in favor of that

#s92
But I am in favor of it for criminal cases

#s93
so there 's a difference of my view there for those two

#s98
Have you ever had to serve jury duty

#s101
Uh-huh

#s105
Uh-huh

#s108
Uh-huh

#s109
It is n't

#s110
sort of amazed me

#s111
they first caught up with me for the first time in uh

#s112
that would have been about uh twenty years too

#s114
uh uh just last year

#s115
and uh the case I heard was a criminal case

#s116
and it seemed it really trivial

#s117
It involved two bicycles

#s119
We did n't do the sentencing

#s120
The judge did

#s122
So

#s124
we we a- rendered a verdict

#s125
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing

#s128
And that was here in Wisconsin

#s129
So I I do n't know if that varies from state to state or if it
