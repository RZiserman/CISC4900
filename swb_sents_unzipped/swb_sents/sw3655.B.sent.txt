Oh well my my feelings on it is uh I would n't take a child to day-care

#s3
You know

#s5
I mean I 'd I 'd wind up uh just a baby-sitter in a home

#s8


#
Well too many kids and and I think too many infections and things coming in

#s13
Yeah

#s14
sicknesses and

#s15
I do n't know

#s16
then all the things you hear about them

#s19
Yeah

#s20
I mean I 'm sure there 's some good ones

#s21
but I just

#s22
I do n't think that I would uh

#s25
Oh uh-huh

#s29
Oh yeah

#s30

Well one thing that 's kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a a infant or to at a day-care where they 're taken care of

#s79
Yeah

#s80
yeah

#s83

#s84
it is

#s89
Yeah

#s91
Yeah

#s92
it it is I think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will

#s95
Yeah

#s96
yeah

#s105
Oh yeah

#s107
