#s4
Yeah

#s6
So have you ever served on a jury

#s11
Yeah

#s12
I finally served on one last year

#s13
I 've um been voting for years

#s14
and I could n't figure out why I had n't been called yet

#s16
and I finally was

#s17
So it was an interesting experience

#s18
I was kind of boring

#s20
Uh it was uh uh it was uh well let 's see it was municipal court

#s23
so it was a combination of uh

#s24
and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks

#s26
so it was a combination of criminal and civil

#s27
and they had uh

#s28
well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors

#s30
and then it was always exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room

#s34
Uh yeah

#s35
the judge did

#s36
Uh I uh I had a hard time getting seated on a jury

#s37
I kept getting uh

#s38
I 'd be questioned uh for empaneling the jury

#s39
and they kept uh dismissing me

#s42
Course they do n't have to give a reason

#s43
but it 's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know

#s45
they want to get the best uh mix for their case

#s46
so they ask all kinds of wild questions

#s48
Yeah

#s49
well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions

#s50
and I think part of it was they did n't uh they did n't like the fact that I do n't drink any more

#s51
So

#s56
Yeah

#s57
that was probably it

#s59
although in my case I might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught

#s60
I do n't know

#s65
Well I was never there never there for any sentencing

#s66
Uh I finally got empaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day

#s67
and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case

#s68
and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he did n't need to deliberate because he 'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty

#s70
So uh they appointed me jury jury foreman

#s71
and I uh did n't think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict

#s72
so I told the judge that we were n't were unable to reach a verdict because we could n't get one member of the jury to deliberate

#s74
So the whole thing had to be tried over again

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Yeah

#s79
it was uh it was funny

#s80
The uh

#s81
I ju- I I do n't know

#s82
I uh I did n't uh uh I did n't like not being able to deliberate

#s84
I uh I I wanted to vote guilty for the guy

#s85
and the other people were kind of mixed

#s87
so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again

#s88
Cost him a lot of money

#s89
I 'm sure

#s93
Uh it must have been six

#s95
Yeah

#s99
Um

#s101
Um

#s105
Yeah

#s106
Well let 's see

#s108
is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous

#s109
and

#s114
Uh-huh

#s119
Uh it was too circumstantial

#s123
Um
