#s2
Yes

#s4
That 's a rather rather broad topic

#s6
Yeah

#s8
Uh we live in Plano

#s11
Uh and where you are

#s14
Uh-huh

#s15
Right

#s16
Right

#s17
that is so frightening

#s19
Uh do you have children in school

#s23
Yeah

#s25
Well I have

#s26
my oldest is his first year in high school

#s27
so we have all this to to look forward to

#s28
and it is really frightening uh to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety

#s29
I mean certainly you know you ca n't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas

#s30
but you know when you ca n't even send them on their normal activities in safety it it 's really frightening

#s32
And uh I really you know

#s33
they 're coming down on the principal

#s34
but I really do n't know what they can do

#s35
I mean it 's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs

#s36
and I I really do n't know what what can be done

#s39
Well I do n't either

#s40
but apparently they just really are

#s41
Uh I mean to me in Plano you would think that would be about you know about as innocent as you could get for for being in a a large area

#s42
But you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns

#s43
and uh someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun

#s45
And I mean it just scared me to death

#s46
and you know they called the police

#s47
and and nothing happened

#s48
but my goodness you know it it could have easily

#s50
Maybe so

#s54
Yeah

#s57
Oh no

#s59
I just ca n't imagine that

#s62
Right

#s65
Right

#s66
well I can see you know especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous

#s67
but certainly I ca n't understand not calling the police

#s69
I

#s73
Right

#s74
Well I I think you 're right there

#s75
I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business

#s76
but I think that 's real dangerous

#s77
and uh I do n't know

#s78
I try to tell my kids just just kind of be aware of what 's around them you know

#s79
and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever

#s81
But uh

#s88
Yeah

#s90
Well maybe this thing with with the child at school maybe that will make people think a bit more and you know take some steps to to correct it

#s91
I do n't know

#s92
it 's it really is is frightening

#s94
I uh

#s98
I do n't know

#s99
I mean I do n't know the details

#s100
This was not a child that was on the team

#s101
It was someone that uh show- you know just kind of showed up at the field

#s103
Uh it was a a student age person

#s104
but I 'm not even
