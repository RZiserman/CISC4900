#s3
I agree

#s4
I think taxes are high

#s7
Oh yes

#s8
Uh-huh

#s12

#s17
Oh

#s21
Right

#s22
Yeah

#s23
I I agree

#s24
I MUMBLEx think it 's about the time of the year when you just start getting

#s25
well if you do get money back from like jobs

#s26
I 'm still a student

#s27
so uh I only work part time

#s29
so I I get a check back

#s30
so

#s32
from from taxes

#s33
but

#s35
Yeah

#s36
It is

#s37
but it 's not much

#s38
So

#s41
No

#s45
Yeah

#s47
Yeah

#s52
Yeah

#s53
There you go

#s57
Right

#s58
yeah

#s59
I do n't know

#s60
I

#s61
do n't seem like they are doing much with it

#s62
MUMBLEx I mean there 's plans there

#s63
and now that they are voting and people you know getting into MUMBLEx drug and that stuff

#s65
They have nice plans

#s66
and uh but they do n't always work

#s67
and then you know they try to raise taxes more

#s68
and I do n't what happens with all the money because if their plans do n't work you know

#s69
but taxes get raise

#s70
so I do n't know

#s71
I 'm not really into politics uh

#s73
I do n't really understand it

#s75
but it 's just you know

#s78

#s109
there is not much out there that is fair

#s110

#s112
Huh

#s113
