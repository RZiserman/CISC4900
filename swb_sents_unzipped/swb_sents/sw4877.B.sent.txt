#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
How old are your children

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Well they 're going to be getting there

#s15
Yeah

#s16
U- uh-huh

#s17
Oh I see

#s19
I have uh five children

#s20
I have a eighteen year old son

#s21
The rest of my girls are like twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine

#s23
And I have three granddaughters right now

#s25
And uh I uh

#s26
one 's in Iowa

#s28
And uh she 's she 's a teacher

#s29
and what she does is she teaches at a preschool

#s31
And and so she kind of

#s32
and they let her bring her her little daughter in for free

#s34
And then so MUMBLEx

#s35
but she just works part-time

#s37
Then I have another daughter in uh Bountiful Utah

#s38
and she has to work full-time

#s39
and it 's just tearing her apart

#s40
She has a private baby-sitter

#s42
And uh the baby just screams

#s43
I mean the baby is like seventeen months

#s44
and she just screams

#s46
Well even if she knows that they 're fixing to get ready to go over there

#s47
They 're not even there yet you know

#s52
And and then I have my uh uh I have a seven month old granddaughter

#s53
and uh her mother stays home

#s54
and she they live they live with us You know in as Orange County is really expensive

#s57
They live with us

#s58
and so of course we love it Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time

#s59
But uh uh she just

#s60
uh she used to work in pre in the preschool and and and child care

#s61
and she says after working in there

#s62
and and you know here she was a provider

#s63
but you know there 's only so much one person can do

#s65
She said it 's so awful

#s66
She said she 'll never put her child in a in a in a preca- in a p- in a preschool

#s68
I 'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere

#s70
But it 's really it 's really really very difficult

#s71
and

#s75
Well when when

#s76
the uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years I stayed home

#s78
And uh then after that I I went to work

#s80
And uh uh uh a couple of times I just uh uh you know

#s81
th- then I had one job

#s82
and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job

#s83
And then and then like about later I I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter

#s84
Supposed to be good uh recommended person from the church

#s85
and I knew her personally

#s86
She had two kids of her own and everything

#s87
But I quit my job because I could n't stand how she was taking care of my child

#s89
I mean first of all uh her children were sick all the time

#s90
So when my son stayed over there he got sick

#s93
Same thing same thing that the her kids had right

#s96
And so uh we did n't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock

#s97
Then he she 'd take my son and her daughter over t- to kindergarten

#s98
But s-

#s99
that day uh I was saying now he he 's sick

#s100
And she goes well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have

#s101
That 's what he got you know

#s102
Goes well okay

#s103
so it 's not like he 's going to infect her kids

#s104
But then what happened was is I said uh he just threw up

#s105
and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty

#s106
so she said well she 'll keep him home

#s107
and he 'll probably just sleep anyway

#s108
Well you know what

#s109
that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten

#s110
She sent him to kindergarten

#s111
As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him

#s112
and he threw up again

#s113
and they put him in the nursery uh they put him in the nurse 's office

#s116
And then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter

#s117
Called her

#s118
and they said uh that he 's sick

#s119
Well she was n't home

#s121
I mean her all her kids were sick

#s122
but she was n't home right

#s123
And her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick

#s124
Now why did n't he why did n't she keep him home with her

#s125
No

#s126
she did n't do that

#s127
So it got to the point where he 's he 's supposed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty

#s128
And I had to leave work

#s129
It was it was five o'clock in the evening

#s130
and I found out he was still there at school

#s131
And they were calling me

#s132
and they said somebody 's got to pick him up

#s133
And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school

#s134
I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff

#s135
And he had a hundred and four fever

#s136
They could n't uh give him anything because they 're not allowed to at school and everything

#s138
I was so furious

#s139
I I quit that job

#s140
and I stayed home for awhile longer

#s141
Then I went and got a uh a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better

#s145
Yeah

#s146
but uh I have n't had any good really very good experience with child care
