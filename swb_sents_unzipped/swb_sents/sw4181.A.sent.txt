#s1
I do n't think anybody pays too little

#s5
Do you get hit up for local taxes there

#s11
Oh so y- y- you get the whole smorgasbord

#s14
Well I I actually live in New Hampshire

#s15
tax free or die

#s16
Uh-huh

#s21
No

#s22
actually there 's no sales tax in New Hampshire either

#s24
No

#s25
what there is is very high property taxes because that 's how they fund schools and everything

#s27
The only problem is I work in Massachusetts

#s28
so they they hit me up for the five percent there

#s31
Yep

#s32
but it

#s33
well you know we

#s34
it 's only a state tax here no local

#s36
We 've got a five percent sales tax

#s38
But uh the problem is that so I 'm paying state tax even if I do n't live here

#s40
But at least on things like stock options and things like that they do n't tax me

#s42
So that 's not too bad

#s52
Oh I I mean I I 'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on I mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know I actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year which was no fun

#s56
Right

#s57
and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A which is taxes where you

#s60
most people forget about them because you 've g- you know you ca n't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year

#s62
But so you know and then you know like a five percent surtax

#s63
I 'm paying forty percent tax

#s68
Yeah

#s69
well I I mean I think there 's some people there y- certainly are some things where you need infrastructure

#s70
and you need you n- you know

#s72
there are things government does better you know

#s73
I think government does a better space program than you 're going to get out of private individuals

#s75
but you know I think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way

#s77
or You know and and just tremendous amounts of you know

#s80
so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in into into programs that you know

#s82
yeah

#s83
they are they are a fat

#s84
You know I think the military is really fat

#s85
I think that a lot of the the H E W services although they 're providing necessary services have too much fat in them

#s89
You know like we

#s90
Yeah

#s91
I mean we we spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals

#s92
and you know then you look at how well they 're managed you know

#s93
I do n't think we 're getting our money 's work out worth out of there

#s94
I think it 's all going into into bureaucrats

#s102
Well be- between him and Reagan

#s103
yeah

#s107
The great communicator

#s109
Oh oh yeah

#s110
they think

#s111
Oh yeah

#s112
and then they go and say I 'm not c-

#s113
Congress they 're the fault for it

#s115
But you know the other thing is it 's tricky though

#s116
because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right let 's cut the military budget

#s118
Well yeah

#s119
then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire

#s121
you lose

#s122
Grotten Connecticut goes

#s123
so you know it 's like you know it 's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know

#s124
if the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load

#s125
and they 're not contributing taxes

#s127
So you know it 's it 's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut

#s132
MUMBLEx

#s136
Who are n't contributing

#s137
Right

#s138
yeah

#s141
And uh in our

#s143
Right

#s144
But what 's very funny is in our town meeting they were v-

#s145
th- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution d- for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes

#s148
They say I want to pay for this and this and this and this and this

#s149
Course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they do n't use

#s151
Yeah
