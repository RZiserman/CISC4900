Okay

#s2
well do you have a pet

#s6
Two cats

#s7
you 're lucky

#s8
Your two fish

#s10
Well my husband

#s11
you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing

#s13
My husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog

#s14
So we have a black Labrador

#s16
Beautiful gorgeous black Labrador

#s17
but to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm

#s20
and

#s21
Well because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind uh he sleeps in the laundry room

#s22
and then he goes out for the day

#s23
But this this is a beautiful dog

#s24
and he is wonderful with our little girls

#s25
and he is he 's comes from a purebred line

#s26
and there 's nothing you could say bad about him except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle

#s29
And this is huge

#s30
You know course when he runs around the yard he just digs

#s31
he does n't know that he 's tearing up things

#s32
but he does

#s35
And the worst part that I had with him he 's he 's three now was when he was uh about eight months old

#s37
and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one

#s38
and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour

#s39
And I came home

#s40
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall

#s42
And it was in the floor

#s43
and I just about lost it

#s44
and I called

#s45
and I said come home and get your dog

#s46
And so he said well puppies just chew when they 're nervous

#s47
and I well I wish you had told me you know

#s49
and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum

#s50
He kept picking at it

#s51
and I did n't kn-

#s52
the the tile in the kitchen

#s53
and picked a hole in it

#s54
So the last thing he did was when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch

#s55
And I told my husband I said you know it 's either me or the dog

#s56
and he looked at me like well you know

#s58
He loves this dog

#s59
and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him

#s60
and he 's a good dog

#s61
so it 's one of those things I 'm just having to get used to

#s62
and that 's why I laughed when they called with the topic

#s63
I thought oh boy do I have a pet

#s64
But I I grew up with cats

#s65
and I 'm very comfortable

#s67
Yeah

#s70
Oh

#s72
She 's old

#s74
Is n't she

#s75
Oh I started to say

#s76
then you broke your heart

#s79
Oh

#s81
Oh

#s84
Bless your heart

#s86
That makes me feel so bad

#s89
Yeah

#s90
Oh no

#s93
Oh

#s94
Oh no

#s98
Oh that 's awful

#s99
I never heard of that before

#s103
Uh-huh

#s105
Or the smell or something

#s109
Uh-huh

#s112
Well d- now does your cat sleep in the house

#s114
They are they are house cats

#s116
Yeah

#s118
Oh yeah

#s119
good

#s122
Oh

#s123
But the cat does n't destruct does it

#s124
See it does n't do anything

#s127
See

#s130
Oh no

#s132
Yeah

#s136
Oh

#s137
Oh no

#s140
Oh that is

#s144
They do wreck things

#s145
Well I 'm not either

#s147
I 'm not either

#s148
and it 's just been

#s152
He 's beautiful

#s153
but it 's just one of those concessions I just had to make

#s154
but I kind of ignore him

#s155
Now today 's the first cold we 've had in Texas

#s156
and it 's really cold and drizzly

#s157
and it 's freezing

#s159
and people are doing their fires

#s160
and I brought him in because he 's just a wet mess out there

#s161
and he 's in the laundry room with this little carpet square

#s162
and he 's just huddled up like if you 'll be nice to me I wo n't make any trouble you know

#s163
And then my daughters both have hamsters

#s165
And I I

#s167
They 're eleven and eight

#s168
and I gave in at Christmas

#s170
and they have they keep their cages real clean

#s171
It always smells of cedar

#s172
and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and

#s174
I think they 're cutting us off

#s177
Oh

#s180
Oh okay

#s182
Okay

#s186
Oh okay

#s189
I understand

#s191
Okay

#s192
well

#s194
they 'll cut us off pretty soon

#s197
Yeah

#s198
I know

#s204
How does

#s206
the salt water

#s207
Salt water or

#s209
Yeah
