So Julie how do you feel about AIDS research

#s3
I 'd agree too

#s4
but I mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know uh you know

#s5
it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research than a l- l- longer ago

#s9
You know because you know because uh the country 's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients

#s11
Uh-huh

#s15
I think they cover AIDS

#s16
but what they do is uh if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they 'll uh check to see if you 're H I V positive

#s18
and if you are not only will they not give you uh a policy

#s19
but they 'll uh they have like

#s20
there 's like you know a database of people that have tested positive

#s21
so you 'll never be able to get insurance ever again

#s24
Yeah

#s25
I think a lot of it was was just that you know becau- because of of the audi- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about

#s28
That

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
yeah

#s34
uh yeah

#s35
one one one h- one humorous retort I heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know God 's punishment was that then lesbians must be God 's chosen people

#s38
But uh

#s41
So uh

#s43
Uh do you think d- you mean do you actually think we 're doing enough right now to

#s50
Private organizations

#s51
Uh-huh

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
I mean it seems that you know it 's just you know of it 's just going to reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we 'd nip it in the bud to q- quote Barney Fife

#s65
Uh-huh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s68
Uh-huh

#s69
I would probably agree with that

#s72
Uh so do do you think it 's more important to spend money on research or for support of uh people

#s77
Uh-huh

#s78
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s90
I think it 's I think it stands a really interesting question of uh
