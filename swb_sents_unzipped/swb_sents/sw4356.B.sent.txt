I 've heard some about Saturns

#s3
I do n't know a lot about them

#s4
I have n't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight 's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the I guess the Japanese cars

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
Yeah

#s11
Um Yeah

#s12
I 've heard a lot of people like them

#s13
Uh yet I do n't know wh- whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point

#s14
I 'm kind of

#s15
my card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky

#s16
and so uh

#s18
Well let 's see

#s19
I li- I like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind

#s20
and that 's not just the driver and the passenger

#s21
but that 's the person who 's working on it

#s22
cause I do al- almost all my own maintenance and uh those types of things

#s24
And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a ca- car anymore that 's that 's fairly easy for me to work on it 's just not very eas- it 's not very

#s25
almost unlikely at this point

#s27
And uh

#s31
Ooh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s42
Well I 've got an eighty-three Saab

#s44
And I find that for a normal you know everyday things It 's really very easy to work on

#s45
and so uh you know I 'm kind of spoiled

#s46
I used to have a MUMBLEx Chevy

#s48
With a three fifty in it

#s50
And uh I really liked working on it Uh cause it was pretty easy too

#s51
It was about a nineteen seventy

#s52
So I 'm kind of uh biased in that

#s53
and you know I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore

#s55
And that 's kind of that 's that 's probably one thing I 'd look at

#s56
I think another thing I 'd look at is safety

#s60
Huh

#s61
That 's a real nice car I think

#s63
I 've driven some uh Tauruses over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips Uh as rental cars

#s65
And I 've always been very impressed with the Taurus

#s66
It 's a really nice car

#s67
I think it 's very it 's a stylish car both inside and out

#s68
It 's comfortable to drive

#s69
Uh reasonable performance

#s70
and this is out in California where where they do n't make a car that 's got reasonable performance anymore

#s72
Uh I 've been real impressed with that

#s73
Yo-

#s74
and I did n't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
Oh I think that That 's excellent

#s82
That 's excellent because

#s87
Oh

#s92
Uh-huh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
Sure

#s96
Those are

#s98
yeah

#s99
that that would be a good deal to go with

#s101
Okay

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
What do you what do you looking for in in those

#s105
What what attracts you to the Saturns

#s106
Or or of course we 've already talked you know

#s107
the Taurus is safe

#s108
But wh- what kind of things are you looking for

#s111
Uh-huh

#s114
Uh-huh

#s119
Yeah

#s122
Uh-huh

#s124
Uh-huh

#s127
Okay
