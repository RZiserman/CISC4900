#s1


#
Yeah

#s6
All right

#s8
Yeah

#s9
I 'm kind of into it

#s10
I 'm uh kind of a sailor

#s12
I 'm up in Minneapolis now

#s13
but I was in Florida

#s14
so uh yeah

#s15
I was kind of into it for a while there

#s17
Yeah

#s18
for the most part

#s19
Yeah

#s21
I had a little sail

#s23
No

#s25
What part of Texas you from

#s27
Okay

#s28
whereabouts is that

#s30
Okay

#s31
all right

#s33
Is that right

#s35
Wow

#s36
that 's pretty wild

#s39
Okay

#s40
so you got some lakes around you can do that on

#s42
You do skiing and stuff

#s43
or

#s46
Yeah

#s47
All right

#s49
Yeah

#s51
All right

#s54
Yeah

#s55
that sounds good

#s56
Yeah

#s57
we 've uh our

#s58
the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now

#s61
Yeah

#s63
Not not not too many

#s64
no

#s65
But uh no

#s66
I just got back from a weekend

#s67
We went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing

#s68
It was pretty nice

#s69
but uh no I I have uh I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I do did a lot of sailing on and stuff

#s71
That 's a lot of fun

#s72
but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too

#s73
they 're kind of into it

#s75
Oh yeah

#s76
I guess it 's pretty uh fishing 's a pretty big thing

#s77
huh

#s79
Yeah

#s81
Yeah

#s82
All right

#s83
So where about in Texas is that

#s84
Is that centrally located

#s85
or

#s88
Uh no

#s89
what what major city is nearby

#s91
Okay

#s92
and that 's south or north of there or something

#s95
Yeah

#s96
Okay

#s98
Oh okay

#s99
all right

#s100
Well that sounds pretty good

#s101
Does uh

#s102
I guess the weather

#s103
does that stay pretty constant there

#s104
or

#s106
Yeah

#s108
Okay

#s109
well that 's pretty temperate

#s110
Yeah

#s111
that 's not too bad

#s112
But uh yeah

#s113
have you done uh any other boating then

#s114
or

#s119
Yeah

#s121
Oh that 's great

#s122
Yeah

#s123
I

#s125
Oh that 's fantastic

#s126
Yeah

#s127
I used to uh kind of be that way myself when I lived in uh north western Florida in the panhandle

#s128
I used to sail about every day

#s129
I 'd work go to work

#s131
Yeah

#s132
it 's a lot of fun

#s133
It 's uh

#s134
especially if you get a a pretty fast boat

#s135
like those catamarans are pretty fast

#s138
You can actually

#s141
Well actually I I 've known how to sail pretty much my whole life

#s142
Uh my family 's pretty into it

#s144
and uh I took sailing lessons when I was about six

#s145
and then uh

#s147
Yeah

#s148
it it 's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know uh just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it

#s150
So it 's it 's not too bad

#s151
it 's pretty easy to get the hang of I think

#s152
and uh generally everybody I 've I 've known has kind of gotten into it

#s153
but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fine

#s156
Yeah

#s157
yeah

#s158
lot of people do n't do n't see the excitement in sailing

#s159
but then again they may nev- m- they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran

#s161
and uh that 's when you really start getting into speed You know

#s162
you actually some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers

#s163
they get so fast you know

#s165
Yeah

#s166
they get pretty quick

#s167
but

#s169
uh

#s170
Yeah

#s171
yeah

#s172
I have n't I have n't personally done that

#s173
but uh the races

#s174
I I work with a guy right now that uh races catamarans in the summertime

#s176
and uh he 's pretty gassed about it

#s177
He 's got a good uh

#s179
Well he uh he 's from Detroit

#s181
so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes I think and does his sailing

#s182
Uh for me I I go back to Orlando uh in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast

#s183
We 're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast

#s184
and there 's a lot of places there you can go you know

#s185
So uh so that 's a good thing

#s187
But yeah

#s188
so what do you do for a job

#s190
Oh really

#s192
Okay

#s193
is that for T I

#s194
or

#s197
Okay

#s198
Are they primarily electronic then

#s200
Okay

#s202
Well that

#s205
Right

#s207
Oh okay

#s208
Great

#s209
Yeah

#s210
how do you like it down there in Texas

#s212
Yeah

#s214
Oh no doubt

#s216
Okay

#s217
I 've never been to Texas

#s218
I 've been to Oklahoma

#s219
but uh that 's about as far as

#s221
Yeah

#s222
Okay

#s223
well that 's good because I did n't like Oklahoma that well
