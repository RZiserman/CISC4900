Okay

#s2
You probably uh more up on this subject than I am

#s3
but the roles that women have played in the last pup- couple of year in our or couple of generations

#s7
You bet

#s9
You bet

#s10
You know where I 've noticed it more I think is

#s11
I 'm a traveling salesperson

#s12
and I have traveled most of my life

#s13
and I know just especially in the last oh ten years and really since in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling

#s15
You know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers

#s16
I sell sporting goods

#s17
and even in our industry uh there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things I sell

#s18
and even in the last five or six years boy we see more and more women being involved

#s19
and you know it 's a it 's a credit to them as far as how they 're doing things

#s23
You bet

#s28
You bet

#s29
That 's sort of neat

#s32
Sure

#s33
I think uh it 's the age old thing

#s34
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you 'll see it on T V or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men

#s35
and they 're and they 're doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility

#s37
and you know I that 's a very true statement

#s38
and it should n't uh it should n't be that way You know

#s41
I think so hope so

#s42
a-

#s46
Absolutely

#s48
You know I 've

#s51
Right

#s52
Yeah

#s53
they forget

#s54
Also I think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know

#s55
if a

#s56
a woman Congressman I 'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever

#s58
So they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way

#s59
But I guess just the most significant thing changed for me again as I mentioned was just in traveling

#s60
you see uh more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going

#s64
And I expect you 're right in regards to having two parents now

#s65
That 's a good a good statement

#s66
And I think if in the future it 's even going to be uh more noticeable and more significant

#s73
Wow

#s76
You bet

#s77
Good point

#s79
Right now I 'm self employed

#s80
and and my wife 's always worked

#s81
She 's a schoolteacher

#s82
but for

#s83
she started working

#s84
and then when I first started my business uh

#s85
she was selling real estate at the time

#s86
and hers was the only income we had for three or four months

#s87
so

#s89
You know she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business

#s90
and she still works everyday

#s91
so

#s94
You bet

#s96
Uh-oh

#s98
Enj- enjoying it

#s99
What kind of work do you do

#s101
Well good

#s103
Right

#s104
Married

#s106
Yeah

#s107
Well trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject

#s110
You see the old uh cigarette ads you know about you 've come a long way

#s112
Baby

#s113
right

#s114
and uh

#s116
You think about this when you come to when it comes to a subject like that

#s117
and it 's really true

#s118
Women have come a long way

#s119
and you know
