The biggest problem well like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that uh you know you can throw money at it

#s5
but it 's

#s6
I do n't know

#s7
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know because I mean the general values that we 're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school I mean

#s11
Uh well the values more or less at home and the T V just a general

#s12
I mean learning is not a revered endeavor really

#s13
I mean it 's a lot more

#s14
it 's socially well I wo n't say socially unacceptable

#s15
but whereas like in uh a person that uh stud-

#s16
they put a lot more emphasis on athletics

#s17
and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society

#s18
and I think that carries over to school a lot

#s20
So

#s28
Yeah

#s33
Yeah

#s34
yeah

#s35
you know I wonder if that 's a root problem or not

#s36
because I think about that a lot

#s37
and it 's just like everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now

#s38
but I wonder you know

#s39
do you get the

#s40
oh that 's kind of side tracked

#s41
but uh I just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better

#s43
I thought well you know of course they 're doing better

#s44
and not so much when I was growing up Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools

#s45
but uh they still had a a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material

#s46
I mean everybody that went to a Catholic school had uh at least the parents did at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it

#s49
And I wonder if not so much that uh

#s55
Yeah

#s56
Yeah

#s57
this is interesting because in my mind I do n't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment

#s58
but uh this this was actually inner city

#s60
people were sending

#s61
I mean just because their kids had the ability and the and the drive to do try and get an education they did n't send him to a public school you know

#s62
like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you 're pressured not to learn in instance

#s68
Yeah

#s71
Yeah

#s72
I mean

#s73
and what do you what would you do to fix the school systems

#s75
Yeah

#s82
Yeah

#s84
Yeah

#s85
That 's what I was going to say

#s86
It 's the chicken and the egg thing

#s87
I wonder

#s88
a lot of times you know people I mean a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise

#s90
and you get

#s91
I mean it 's been a while since I been in high school

#s92
They 're even in grade school when they do that

#s93
But I ca n't remember exactly what goes through their head when they 're doing that

#s94
But you got to think in a way it 's kind of a outward showing of that they do n't think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school

#s102
Yeah
