Your turn

#s8
Well I have to say I really do n't have a budget

#s9
Both my wife and I uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means

#s10
and uh our family income at this point is comfortable Upper middle class I guess you might say

#s11
And uh we 're both so uh frugal that uh we really do n't need a budget you know

#s12
We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing

#s16
Well we stay within our means

#s17
but we do n't do it uh by conscious effort

#s18
It just sort of happens automatically

#s20
Although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is uh I would say rather pathological

#s22
Uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than uh uh they were where I came from in uh Dallas

#s24
Yeah

#s25
So uh uh that presents a a real shock

#s28
Ac- ac- actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we 've moved to California

#s29
but

#s32
Yeah

#s34
Yeah

#s35
Uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it

#s36
Uh so budget is not a problem for us

#s37
Uh at least it has n't been

#s38
It may may be at this point

#s39
But uh up until this point it really has n't been

#s40
When I uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago I uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that know in my discipline was like oh six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that

#s41
Uh-huh

#s42
And uh I noted at that point that I was you know if that 's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever

#s43
So I stopped worrying about money

#s45
And it

#s46
never have worried about money since then

#s48
Sometimes uh it 's a bit of a a problem you know because I guess I do n't really manage my money the way I should

#s49
But uh I suppose I 've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments

#s50
but

#s57
Well I guess we 're both lucky in that regard then

#s59
How big is your family

#s61
I see

#s64
So how

#s65
you whe- once you get ten children though you may have

#s68
Oh all right

#s70
I have two kids

#s71
Uh one nine and one thirteen

#s72
Oh

#s73
and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point

#s76
I give them a I give them an allowance

#s77
and they uh

#s78
I basically give my son ten dollars a week

#s79
and I put half of it in the bank

#s80
and I give give him the other half in cold cash

#s82
And uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wi- do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank

#s83
But at least it is n't you know burning a hole in his pocket

#s85
If he wants to use it he has to go get it

#s86
and that usually
