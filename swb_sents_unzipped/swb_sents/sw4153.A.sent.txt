Okay

#s2
Well um I used to work in a day care center

#s4
I worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center

#s5
and it is they can be deceiving to people

#s6
I did not work there long because I could n't handle the the treatment that the children got

#s7
and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers all over you know the um city

#s9
and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left

#s11
So um I think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when they 're not expecting it

#s13
Because they do do things differently when you 're not around

#s14
so

#s18
Uh-huh

#s19
Right

#s21
Uh-huh

#s26
Uh-huh

#s29
Well this one was set up good

#s30
I mean they had two teachers to every room Um sometimes three

#s32
And they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool

#s34
The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough

#s35
They did not show them care to these small children who are being left

#s37
Um they

#s38
one time I picked up this little boy who was crying

#s39
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other You know

#s41
he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up

#s42
And I said no

#s43
this child was crying and needed some comfort you know

#s45
what is your problem

#s46
So um

#s48
Yes

#s50
Right

#s51
They did

#s52
they had like um the the crawlers the babies that did n't walk in one room The ones that were starting to walk in one room

#s54
Then they had like the um three three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives You know just like that

#s56
You know they really did separate them well

#s59
It was just the teachers themselves

#s61
Right

#s62
But

#s63
yeah

#s64
that they 're not

#s65
Yeah

#s66
Their system

#s67
Right

#s68
But their but their system was was great

#s69
but um the you know the caring just was n't there

#s71
The one woman that taught that did the babies I worked with her

#s72
and she was fabulous

#s74
She loved them babies

#s75
and she loved them and cared for them

#s76
But um every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and um you know would make me a nervous wreck

#s77
so you know

#s81
Yeah

#s82
these kids are just in a day care center all day and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care

#s84
they 're just there You know Going through this routine which is lousy

#s89
Uh-huh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s99
Yeah

#s100
you do n't see that much

#s105
That 's cute

#s109
Yeah

#s110
that has to be with a day care center

#s113
I 've never heard of that

#s114
That 's that 's a new one on me

#s119
Uh-huh
