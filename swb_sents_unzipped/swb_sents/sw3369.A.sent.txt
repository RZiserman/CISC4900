Well have you seen a new movie lately

#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Okay

#s7
I uh I have n't seen either one of those

#s8
Uh what what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though

#s14
Well maybe you uh you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES

#s16
Okay

#s18
What did you think of that one

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s26
I uh I just moved down in fact from South Dakota in in June

#s27
and that 's when the movie was filmed

#s29
and uh we when when the movie came out we went

#s30
uh my dad lives in the state capital which is Pierre

#s32
and it was filmed right outside of Pierre

#s33
In fact the buffalo the scene the big buffalo herd scene that was that was a live scene

#s35
Uh there 's a guy that has got a a buffalo farm

#s36
and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo

#s37
and and uh we my dad has got a little plane

#s38
we flew over it all a- looked at the buffalo

#s39
it was really neat

#s40
But uh so we are watching the the movie in the movie theater in Pierre

#s42
and uh just every time I would start to get into the movie and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey there 's John Red Eagle you know

#s44
or you know they 'd start recognizing people

#s46
Yeah

#s47
So I kind of I think I enjoyed it more when I when I watched it on video cassette than I did uh in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they 'd say that

#s48
I 'd go now now which one could that be you know

#s50
and I 'd I 'd start trying to focus in on people instead of of picking up the overall

#s52
Right

#s53
Exactly

#s55
So but I I thought it was a good film

#s56
But you are right

#s57
I think I think it was very one sided

#s61
Sure

#s64
Right

#s66
In fact I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night

#s67
and it was a similar uh situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a an army fort

#s69
Um but it was an interesting movie

#s70
Uh have you seen PRETTY WOMAN

#s72
Now I thought that was a good show

#s76
Yeah

#s78
It did n't uh it did n't have any real social bearing

#s79
or uh and it was n't really a comedy

#s80
but it was an enjoyable movie

#s81
It was it was kind of like the STAR WARS s- series you know just something a little different yet believable

#s91
Uh now are you are you going to see or do you are you much of a STAR TREK fan

#s92
are you going to see this next one that 's coming out

#s94
Have you seen the rest

#s96
I think I 've missed one

#s97
I 'm not sure

#s98
but I think I 've missed one

#s101
Was that here in Dallas

#s105
Okay

#s106
Because we had one here in Dallas

#s112
Uh-huh
