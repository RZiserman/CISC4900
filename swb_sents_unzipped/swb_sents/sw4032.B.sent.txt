#s3
Yes

#s4
I do

#s5
Uh I like to uh play basketball and weight lifting

#s6
Those are probably the two main things I like to do

#s10
Yeah

#s11
Um in in in the winter you typically it 's it 's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis

#s12
Um I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall

#s14
but in the winter it gets pretty cold

#s16
Um yeah

#s17
so it 's mostly indoor sports I think in the winter

#s19
Um how about yourself

#s23
Uh-huh

#s27
Uh-huh

#s28
Right

#s29
Do you do uh any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise

#s36
Uh-huh

#s43
Huh

#s44
Yes

#s45
it 's it 's it 's aero- it 's similar to aerobics with weights

#s48
but it 's like low impact aerobics just with weights

#s51
Okay

#s52
are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics

#s58
Uh yes

#s59
I have

#s60
In in Atlanta that 's um

#s61
most of the health clubs are all

#s63
that 's the that 's the in thing

#s65
At first it was just regular aerobics

#s66
but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over

#s69
Um it they call it a low impact aerobics

#s70
and it 's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time

#s72
And from when I 've done it it does give you a good a real good workout

#s73
But only thing I 'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know

#s74
that and movement of going up on the step you know

#s75
that could create a problem

#s79
They they seem to think that it it wo n't

#s80
but you never know

#s84
Yeah

#s85
I I think my ankles probably are my main weak point

#s87
But I 've I 've kind of taken care of that

#s88
I wear high tops and then also an an- a support ankle brace which is very stiff

#s90
and um we- wearing that I have n't had any problems in the past year or so

#s94
Yeah

#s96
Yeah

#s97
I

#s101
Uh-huh

#s102
Yeah

#s103
I did I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy

#s106
I mean it would only take three or four days

#s107
and I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way

#s112
But um so how how successful is your exercise video

#s114
Uh-huh

#s117
Uh-huh

#s120
Uh-huh

#s124
Uh-huh

#s128
So it 's a good workout

#s133
Uh-huh

#s134
So in the winter I guess there 's a lot of

#s135
it 's quite cold and snow
