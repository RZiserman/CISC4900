#s2
Well

#s7
Yeah

#s8
uh I guess I basically agree that uh

#s9
do you think it 's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they 'll take drugs

#s10
I mean suppose they found out some other way

#s12
Yeah

#s17
Yeah

#s20
Yeah

#s26
have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested

#s27
or

#s30
Yeah

#s32
I once too

#s33
so

#s34
Yeah

#s39
Yeah

#s40
I had it during a job interview

#s41
and I just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them to do this

#s43
and I 'm just like well uh I 'm not even going to think much about it if you 're going to treat me with this much respect even before you 've gotten to know me

#s57
Uh-huh

#s62
Yeah

#s63
well like you say I mean if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing I mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors

#s66
And I mean if you are doing drugs and it 's causing a problem then they 'll notice it for other reasons

#s68
Yeah

#s74


#
Well do you think it 's should be illegal for an employer to do this

#s78
or

#s80
Yeah

#s86
I tend to to view it

#s87
even though I do n't think I 'd work for a company that did that I sort of want to defend an employer 's rights as opposed to an in- uh in addition to an individual 's rights

#s88
but an employer really I think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to

#s90
and if they say they do n't want smokers I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that

#s92
Uh and I do n't really
