Well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime

#s2
or is that a crime free zone there

#s5
I 'm afraid you 're right

#s8
Oh my

#s12
By your house

#s14
Oh my goodness

#s15
Aye aye aye Oh my

#s17
That 's that 's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening

#s24
Oh boy

#s26
Unfortunately yes

#s28
Yes

#s29
I think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get the hoods and the roof- riffraff and everybody else in there

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
and I think

#s33
uh you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek

#s34
but uh we 've been we 've lived here sixteen years

#s35
and now you you know you can tell the change for sure

#s38
Yes

#s39
Well with all the uh Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it 's just prime pickings for people driving by

#s41
Yeah

#s42
You know

#s43
and

#s45
That 's that could n't be too far from you neither

#s49
Oh yes

#s55
I do n't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody

#s59
It 's kind of kind of stupid is n't it

#s60
Uh-huh

#s61
But I guess when people do those things they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time

#s62
It 's looks like easy pickings

#s64
and away you go right

#s67
I think you 're right uh although I think that may be an excuse for people too

#s69
Right

#s71
Right

#s73
Right

#s74
just like the old alcohol idea

#s75
and I think people uh I think when you have haves and have nots you 're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it 's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money

#s80
Oh boy

#s82
Where do you work

#s84
Uh yes

#s85
I think I do

#s86
That uh is that Amelia Earhart -hart School there

#s93
Oh my goodness

#s96
Huh

#s99
Definitely that area that that 's big time

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
Big time there

#s102
sure is

#s104
I do n't think I 'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself MUMBLEx

#s107
that 's the worst neighborhood in the whole c- area
