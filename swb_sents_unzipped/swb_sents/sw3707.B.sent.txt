#s2
Do you

#s10
How old is it

#s12
Uh you you 're you 're in the roughest stages of pet ownership I think

#s16
Well I do n't I do n't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh

#s17
I 've had dogs through the years

#s18
Right now I 've got two and three cats

#s19
but uh and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix

#s20
and we watched it this summer for two to three months

#s21
and it was n't trained quite fully either

#s23
and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog

#s27
I do n't know

#s28
I I 'm old fashioned

#s29
and when I got my my dogs when they when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside

#s31
They say that 's not the way to do it now

#s32
You 're just supposed to

#s34
No

#s35
just just put them outside I guess Unless you ca- catch them in the act

#s38
Yeah

#s41
No

#s42
no

#s43
you do n't want to do that

#s44
but uh

#s49
Does does it just want to sniff around

#s51
Does it just want to sniff around and play when it 's outside

#s55
Yeah

#s57
Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside

#s61
Yeah

#s64
That 's nothing huh

#s65
Well it it it 'll it 'll catch on pretty soon I 'll I 'll bet you

#s66
I I have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever

#s67
and she 's gone the other way

#s68
because she 's so old she does n't have much control

#s70
so we 're battling with that problem

#s72
and she still feels good

#s73
Uh she ca n't hear worth a darn or see very well

#s74
but she 's got a great appetite

#s75
and she knows we 're there by smell

#s77
She 'll be sixteen in May

#s79
And yeah

#s80
but we ca n't bear to do anything because she 's been our friend for all these years

#s82
so we 're putting up with all her accidents

#s84
and the la-

#s85
two nights ago she had diarrhea

#s86
and so that was a bad one

#s87
But uh I think we 're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend

#s91
Uh-huh

#s93
Yeah

#s98
Does it oh

#s99
Uh-huh

#s100
You know maybe you nee- you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes

#s104
Oh

#s106
Well you know we went we went to the junior college Richland

#s108
and we took

#s109
my my daughter was living at home then

#s110
and she took our Golden Retriever oh not the Golden Retriever the Norwegian Elk Hound over there

#s112
and it it it 's a pretty good class

#s113
and they did pretty good except this dog is

#s114
she 's just pretty

#s115
she 's not smart

#s117
So she did n't learn a lot

#s118
but it I think it calmed her down a little bit

#s119
and she 's used to being around other dogs now

#s121
I think it was like a six week program

#s123
Uh I think it was one night a week for like six weeks

#s125
and uh you know it was a group class outside

#s126
It was fairly reasonable too

#s131
Yeah

#s132
they 're they 're usually a high-strung dog are n't they

#s137
Um our our friend has a
