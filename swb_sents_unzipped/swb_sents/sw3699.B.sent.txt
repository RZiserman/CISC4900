#s3
Yes

#s5
We we it 's a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
First house

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
So what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to to renting somebody else 's

#s18
Uh-huh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s23
Do you have is it a fairly large house

#s25
Oh that 's pretty good size

#s26
Yeah

#s28
Uh-huh

#s31
It 's tiny

#s33
It 's not much bigger

#s34
Actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is

#s35
So

#s37
Yeah

#s38
it 's uh it 's only like eleven hundred square feet

#s41
Just one

#s43
Yeah

#s45
But it it uh all the rooms are small I mean

#s46
but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted

#s47
And uh Use an extra one for an office which is handy

#s50
I 'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one I guess

#s51
Rather have lots of rooms and lot- lots of space

#s52
but uh that ends up costing me

#s56
Well they 're it 's pretty typical

#s57
I mean it 's a very very middle class neighborhood

#s58
Uh lots of lots of young couples with you know usu- oh

#s59
I 'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that 's their first homes

#s61
and uh lots of kids and stuff

#s62
and so it it fits well in the neighborhood

#s63
It 's it 's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood

#s64
but on the other hand it 's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want

#s67
Is is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood

#s72
or is it

#s73
Uh-huh

#s77
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
wow eight kids

#s83
Oh my gosh

#s86
Ooh

#s90
I 'm sure with eight

#s91
gosh

#s95
Uh-huh

#s99
Uh-huh

#s100
Yeah

#s106
Yeah

#s107
new ones I mean they they tend to to be real tiny but that uh especially in newer neighborhoods

#s108
my my brother just built a new house

#s109
He lives in Wichita Kansas

#s110
and the um the neighborhood actually fought him on it because he he was um the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood

#s112
Now that 's because he was he 's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff

#s114
and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots MUMBLEx in the neighborhood

#s115
but but they were they were pretty touchy on it

#s118
He was a little surprised

#s120
Uh-huh

#s124
Uh-huh

#s125
Uh-huh

#s130
Uh-huh

#s135
Right

#s137
Kind of depends on when they get in you know

#s143
Oh they have

#s144
it 's gotten

#s145
yeah

#s148
Yeah

#s149
oh

#s151
Uh-huh

#s154
Um

#s155
Well see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in South Austin

#s157
And uh and what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one

#s158
and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled uh codes and and and stuff

#s159
and then they come back in

#s160
and and then they sell
