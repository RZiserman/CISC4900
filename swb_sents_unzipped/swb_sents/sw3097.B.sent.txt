Hi

#s3
One of the interesting things that I have considered about the role change for women is that women of my age my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the LEAVE IT TO BEAVER housewives

#s5
But we are not living in that world

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
families

#s10
uh-huh

#s12
Oh yeah

#s13
sure

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
That 's one of the

#s19
and it makes you really concerned

#s20
I am glad I raised guys

#s22
You know let the world train them what to do

#s23
But characteristically you know the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home

#s25
And I really would be at a loss to to raise and train a girl

#s26
I think I would

#s30
Oh sure

#s31
Uh-huh

#s36
Oh sure

#s37
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
Uh-huh

#s49
Uh-huh

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Sure

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Uh-huh

#s58
Oh yeah

#s60
I did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said Mom please do not be involved

#s63
Then I went back to work

#s66
Yeah

#s68
Sure

#s70
Right

#s72
Right

#s74
Well you know there 's a lot of things that have happened actually

#s75
and and it 's it 's like the it 's like oil on top of water

#s76
it changes

#s77
but it 's never different in a lot of ways

#s80
Uh women at one time did very heavy physical labor and were expected to maintain a household

#s83
Then as times changed uh as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor even in hous- even in housekeeping and homemaking

#s87
there 's not a lot of physical labor because there are

#s90
Uh-huh

#s92
Right

#s93
And in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion

#s95
or we really do develop some health problems

#s97
So in in that in that respect I am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit

#s100
And uh

#s103
Oh absolutely true

#s104
it 's that 's true with society in general

#s107
but specifically the woman 's role in society has changed

#s109
And you know medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases

#s112
Heart disease was characteristic of men

#s114
now there 's almost equally predominant in women

#s116
And I

#s118
Uh-huh

#s120
Uh-huh

#s122
Right

#s123
and I think that that 's a that 's a symptom of our society

#s124
it 's a symptom that there 's there 's a general illness that needs to be healed

#s126
I do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem

#s127
I am not I am not God

#s130
But I I do know that in raising my boys I really did meet a lot of pressures saying you know you need to get them into music lessons

#s131
you need to get them into sports

#s134
you need to get them into this

#s135
they need to be busy

#s136
and they need to be active

#s137
And I fought all of those things

#s138
I said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me

#s139
and they will say Mom this is important to me

#s140
I want to do it

#s143
otherwise I will guard their ability to have quiet time

#s145
I refused to cram their lives full

#s151
And that 's the way it is with a woman too

#s152
Uh-huh

#s155
Uh-huh

#s156
Uh-huh

#s158
Uh-huh

#s160
Uh-huh

#s161
uh-huh

#s164
Uh-huh

#s166
Well

#s167
Uh-huh

#s169
Uh-huh

#s173
Uh-huh

#s175
Of course

#s176
Uh-huh

#s178
Well I just am very much a believer in quiet personal time

#s179
If you do not have the time to talk to yourself who are you going to talk to

#s180
Right

#s184
And I guarded my children 's rights for that

#s185
and I think that that 's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do

#s187
They are sacrificing their time with themselves

#s188
There 's nothing wrong with sitting and being bored if you thinking internally and you are working on your own self

#s192
You are finding out who you are

#s194
Well I think

#s196
Um Well in the first place it 's not your homework

#s197
it 's your children 's homework

#s199
And I was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help

#s201
I helped them with exactly what they asked for

#s202
and that 's all

#s204
That 's a part of the problem that women have always had

#s205
and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people 's responsibilities

#s207
They They

#s209
That 's right

#s211
That way husbands are crippled

#s213
they are intellectual cripples

#s215
and so are children

#s217
They do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible for themselves

#s219
I do not know why God made women brilliant

#s220
I

#s222
Yes

#s223
but I do not know

#s224
they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems

#s225
They are all things to all people

#s227
and that 's never changed

#s232
Uh-huh

#s233
Uh-huh

#s237
Uh-huh

#s239
Uh-huh

#s241
Uh-huh

#s244
That 's right

#s248
You know I think that 's one of the things that we have today that is very useful

#s249
and I think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it

#s250
and that is mediation training

#s252
Uh we are not talking about strikes or things

#s253
we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises parents and children husbands and wives uh you know boss and employee Those kinds of things Interpersonal mediation

#s258
because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who
