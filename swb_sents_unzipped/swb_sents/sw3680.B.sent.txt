Okay

#s3
Well I 'm a Vietnam era veteran

#s4
and uh I was uh fortunate not to have to serve in the theater

#s5
however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation

#s6
Uh I 'm of the old school that believes that uh the uh uh contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored

#s7
However uh I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker

#s8
Uh but those are my personal thoughts

#s9
and I think that if we 'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we 'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people

#s10
But as it was the politicians ran the the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing

#s11
and we managed to come out uh losers all the way around

#s12
And so this is what trigger- ultimately triggered us uh United States per se being uh deciding to get out of the role of world policeman

#s13
Your views

#s15
Well

#s18
We got into it because of SEATO agreement back just right after World War Two that

#s19
uh we pledged a mutual uh uh defense of of the South Vietnamese

#s20
and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another

#s21
and really we

#s22
I I question us you know now

#s23
of course hindsight is all too clear

#s25
Uh so we 're we we have to have to deal with with the uh situation as as we played it

#s27
I

#s28
do n't get me started on those people

#s29
You know before she before Jane Fonda did did what she did I thought she was a wonderful person

#s30
but after uh uh well

#s31
I just do n't have anything want anything to do with her any more

#s32
because you support uh you support your government

#s34
Uh okay

#s35
right or wrong

#s36
I do n't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong

#s37
because you 're you 're having to deal with again uh

#s38
I think we could have made a different agreement back in for- the for- the late forties era that would have kept MUMBLEx of there

#s43
Can you hold just a second Terry

#s45
One moment please

#s50
Sorry for the delay

#s52
Uh yeah

#s53
this is

#s54
the uh the the uh mutual defense thing was

#s55
we we

#s56
it was complicated

#s57
and I do n't think everybody knows the whole situation

#s58
I do n't

#s59
But from what I can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the South Vietnamese uh should they ask

#s60
Well the French went in and tried their old style warfare and uh got soundly thrashed

#s61
And we did n't do a whole lot better

#s65
Well yeah

#s66
that was the old French colony

#s67
but see the French the French were our uh allies in NATO

#s69
and they 're also our allies in SEATO which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization which has since been uh disbanded as far as I know

#s70
you know NATO is is on the way of being disbanded

#s71
Uh but uh the you know the French

#s72
yeah

#s73
we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah we 'll we 'll help you out if you get in a bind

#s74
Well they got in a bind and says we do n't want to you know play any more

#s76
so uh we we kind of we kind of got got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi- uh um oh operations and then the full scale you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera

#s82
Uh yeah

#s83
yeah

#s84
roughly
