Well I do n't know

#s3
My grandfather is ninety-two years old

#s5
And he is still living by himself

#s6
My grandmother died a couple of years ago

#s7
But he does n't want to to move away

#s8
He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm

#s10
And he recently had to have an operation

#s11
but he just really does n't want to go to a nursing home

#s13
Well he was until this operation

#s14
He has arthritis

#s16
And now I do n't really think he 's doing that well

#s17
And my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him

#s18
And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot

#s20
But uh my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three

#s22
And uh died six weeks after they put him in the home

#s27
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s41
But I just do n't think that nursing homes really do a very good job

#s44
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
But I do n't I mean

#s51
at least I mean I think some nursing homes do that

#s52
But I think a lot of nursing homes really uh are guilty of neglect

#s59
Uh-huh
