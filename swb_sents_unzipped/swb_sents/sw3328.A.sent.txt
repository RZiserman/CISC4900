#s1
Yeah

#s2
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago

#s7
Oh right

#s8
Indianapolis got that did n't they

#s12
Yeah

#s14
Well it seems like a big politics game

#s15
like up here last year the governor was up for re-election

#s16
so he said the budget was fine

#s17
the state did n't have any money

#s18
and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money

#s19
so they raised all our taxes

#s20
And now it 's election time again

#s21
so they 're trying to lower them

#s23
So they 're just talk about lowering them

#s24
but they never do

#s25
they just keep raising them

#s27
Yeah

#s28
me neither

#s29
Well actually they 're going to here because they did n't have a budget for so long

#s30
so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year

#s31
and they 're going to lower it for next year

#s33
I guess they figure they 're going to make up for all they did n't get when they should have had a budget

#s35
Yeah

#s36
yeah

#s37
they say they 're going to lower

#s38
but I 'll see

#s45
Yeah

#s46
so do I

#s47
I mean I 'm a a middle class barely

#s48
but uh I do n't think the rich are paying mo- less not enough

#s49
I think they 're paying too much

#s51
Yeah

#s52
I mean if you 're in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well that 's ridiculous

#s53
Why bother working

#s56
Well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make

#s58
That would be fair

#s60
Yeah

#s61
no loopholes or anything

#s62
Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever

#s65
Right

#s72
Yeah

#s73
that 's the way our state tax is here

#s74
I think it 's pretty fair

#s76
Uh-huh

#s78
Oh

#s82
Oh great

#s83
so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
Yeah

#s89
I guess you have to check yes

#s90
or you come down to the end of the year

#s91
and you do n't have it to give it to them

#s94
Yeah

#s96
Really

#s100
Ouch

#s106
Yeah

#s107
I 'll say

#s109
Y-

#s110
is
