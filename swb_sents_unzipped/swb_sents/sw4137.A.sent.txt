#s1
Let 's see

#s2
mine 's pretty easy actually

#s3
Uh I just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns

#s5
Uh and although I ca n't afford it right now I would just like love to have one

#s9
Well

#s11
No

#s12
regardless of that fact

#s13
It 's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money

#s14
I 'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing

#s16
and uh it seems to just blow the com- compe- competition away

#s18
Handling power everything

#s19
Yeah

#s20
it just got like the top rating

#s21
It was compared up against uh

#s22
let 's see

#s23
there was like the Mazda M X three uh Nissan 's whatever their two N X two thousand the Civic S I

#s24
and it just you know it it dominated over all of them

#s25
Everybody all the uh raters loved it

#s26
I like the I like the styling

#s27
and I seen a few of them actually race

#s28
and they seem to be really good cars for it

#s30
Mustang G T -s

#s31
Uh ca n't afford it

#s34
Right

#s35
yeah

#s36
I 'm a graduate student

#s37
let 's face it

#s38
I do n't make any money

#s39
so

#s44
Yeah

#s45
Yeah

#s46
we 'll see then

#s47
Yeah

#s48
right now I 'm stuck

#s49
I I 've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that

#s50
it 's fast but unreliable

#s51
and trying to get it prepared for racing

#s52
But it 's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the g- Saturn

#s55
Oh yeah

#s56
I 'd do it I 'd use it for both

#s57
The nice thing about autocrossing is you can you can do both

#s60
Uh just like a uh set up a lot of times

#s61
and it 's like really large uh parking lots And pylons and things

#s65
Tight turns hard acceleration

#s66
I 've seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete

#s67
and it 's interesting

#s68
They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class

#s70
Yeah

#s73
Uh what are you thinking about buying

#s76
The Legend

#s77
Uh

#s79
Uh-huh

#s82
Yeah

#s83
Yeah

#s84
well I was I was actually in uh

#s85
a lot of the B M W -s are produced in uh uh Stutgardt and uh and Munich

#s87
and I was I was there this uh summer

#s88
and uh i- I was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for B M W

#s93
Yeah

#s95
Uh

#s96
Oh of course

#s97
of course they are

#s98
They want you to buy their car

#s99
Yeah

#s100
there

#s101
it was it was interesting

#s102
I was at I I also went to uh the Porsche

#s103
and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed

#s105
Yeah

#s106
the uh the B M W is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things

#s107
and everything is put together with exacting tolerances

#s108
and and then you go to Porsche

#s109
and it 's like well uh these cars are completely handmade

#s111
and no two of them are alike

#s112
And

#s115
so it 's like completely opposed

#s116
I do n't know

#s117
which do I like better

#s118
I think I like the Porsche 's philosophy a little bit better although it 's not really practical

#s121
Unless it 's it 's a toy

#s124
Let 's face it

#s125
Yeah

#s126
yeah

#s127
but it it B M W -s good for that

#s128
What kind of driving just like commuting you 'd want to do it use it for

#s132
Wow yeah

#s134
That 's cool

#s137
Yeah

#s138
that 's good

#s139
I also I was impressed by uh by the Mercedes too

#s141
I really I really like the Mercedes

#s144
The factory was nice

#s145
and

#s146
And is it different for the for the B M W

#s149
Probably

#s150
Right

#s151
I can imagine that
