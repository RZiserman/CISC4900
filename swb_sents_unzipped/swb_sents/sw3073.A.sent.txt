#s1
Okay

#s2
I 'm back on

#s4
Um you say you watch evenings mostly

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
Oh so

#s12
Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you 're not going to be there

#s14
Which ones

#s16
Oh

#s18
Oh two they 're going to change

#s19
Well one they 're taking off

#s22
I do n't know what 's going to ha-

#s23
yeah

#s24
we like L A LAW

#s26
We do n't watch THIRTY SOMETHING

#s27
but that 's kind of young for us

#s28
My husband and I are grandparents

#s30
So we do n't watch uh that type of show

#s31
but we like L A LAW

#s32
We like that

#s34
We 're just

#s35
I 'm sorry they 're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there

#s38
I 'm not sure I like the new ones too much

#s41
I just wonder if if uh they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since it 's gone on for so long

#s42
it looks like it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show

#s46
Of course I guess that 's not bad

#s47
Alan Alda did it on MASH

#s50
It has n't hurt him at all

#s51
So do you do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour

#s54
In one hour like QUANTUM LEAP

#s57
That 's one of our favorites

#s61
Right

#s62
which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention You know

#s64
that 's always a bummer too

#s66
Sometimes it 's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one

#s68
We we do that sometimes

#s69
I I guess I 'm I 'm not into real heavy stuff

#s70
L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch

#s71
I I 'll mostly I 'm into it for relaxation

#s73
so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS

#s74
or uh Monday night is real good with me you know

#s75
MAJOR DAD and and uh NORTHERN EXPOSURE and and uh

#s76
oh what 's that one with Burt Reynolds

#s77
That type of show is what we what uh we watch

#s79
We generally just stay on one channel all for all of Monday night just to watch those

#s80
Just some of the times they 're continued

#s81
but mostly they 're just little vignettes

#s82
A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS

#s83
Have you seen that

#s85
That is it 's it 's really funny

#s86
They use like animated

#s87
it 's not like a cartoon

#s88
but it 's like dummies and things that are used

#s90
and uh it 's really um

#s91
and robots probably

#s92
But there 's always a a moral to each story

#s94
Well yo- we watched it

#s95
the times we 've seen it it 's been like on Satur- or excuse me Friday night

#s96
Uh but it 's

#s97
we 've only seen it a couple of times

#s98
But it it 's real

#s99
the first one we saw um they were it it involved a tradition of when a per- person reaches seventy-five

#s100
and I ca n't remember what day they call it

#s101
but but uh the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they 're seventy five over a cliff

#s103
Anyway Anyway it it goes on you know

#s104
and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all

#s105
and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her

#s107
And she said no

#s108
you ca n't do you know

#s109
he ran her out was running to hi- in a wheelchair to hide her

#s110
and she said You ca n't do that

#s112
This is tradition

#s113
This is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the the cliff

#s114
And uh he said I do n't understand

#s115
It 's it 's real funny that they give the teenagers the as the one that questions uh the what 's going on

#s117
And uh in the end of uh the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff uh th- the so- the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says No you ca n't do it

#s118
and then and then uh Oh well we 've got to do it

#s119
It 's tradition

#s120
and the son was you know Why

#s121
And so in in the end he does n't throw her over

#s123
Oh he does n't

#s124
and of course the town thinks he 's just terrible because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he 's broken it

#s125
And then we saw one where this there was a teenage when a teenage boy comes into his manhood

#s126
they call it the night of the howling or something like that

#s127
Uh-huh

#s128
and they all go out and howl you know

#s129
And and the son refused to do it

#s130
He he did

#s131
he thought it was not

#s133
No

#s134
he would n't go howl

#s135
so all the all the people that worked with the father ostracized him

#s137
It is

#s138
It it it 's it 's real interesting to watch the show

#s139
and and wh- the relationship between the family is is really now now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them

#s140
Huh

#s141
So it 's

#s142
our our grandson our oldest grandson is the one that that got us to watching it

#s143
But it really is it moves real fast

#s144
It 's a real short

#s145
and there 's always like I say a moral to it

#s146
and

#s149
Well half hour

#s150
Oh

#s151
That that 's all there is to it

#s152
And and uh they

#s155
Yeah

#s156
it it they they 're trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW Uh the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth

#s157
Uh-huh

#s158
and I guess maybe there are some parts of that

#s159
but I did n't really see that in there

#s160
But what I 've read about it they talk about that

#s161
But anyway we 've we 've enjoyed that

#s162
and and uh I guess mostly I I like the news shows too the news magazines like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that you know all all of those shows if I can do it

#s166
but my husband likes to watch um old movies especially war movies or or uh sports which I 'm not

#s168
No

#s169
I do n't

#s170
Well I I do

#s171
I like ice skating

#s172
and I like uh gymnastics and some track and field

#s173
Uh-huh

#s174
but I I

#s175
and I 'll watch snippets of baseball games

#s176
and I I just do n't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing

#s178
And I do n't ever no matter what 's on I do n't ever just sit and watch T V

#s179
I 'm usually either doing dishes

#s180
or I may be sewing

#s181
or you know I always have or letter writing

#s182
I know

#s183
or I may be working around in the room somehow

#s184
but I do n't I do n't ever just sit and

#s185
I that 's something that comes from your old age you know

#s187
I do n't sit

#s188
Idle hands are the devil 's workshop

#s192
No

#s199
Right

#s201
Right

#s202
well our

#s203
yeah

#s204
if our gra- if our grandchildren are with us that 's they have to watch that

#s205
We do n't watch it unless they 're here

#s212
but Yeah

#s213
It 's it 's um oh

#s214
and you know the the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA 'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS

#s215
We 've wound up sending in one

#s216
That 's something I did n't think that we 'd ever do

#s218
Yeah

#s219
My oldest grandson pulling his tooth

#s220
He 's he 's he would n't let us pull it

#s221
How funny

#s222
and I mean it it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread

#s223
And I and I 'd tell him you know it 's getting ready to fall out

#s224
and he walked around the house with his fa- face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he would n't let anybody pull it

#s225
And he wou- he wound up pull
