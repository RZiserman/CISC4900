#s1
Yeah

#s2
are you there

#s4
Okay

#s5
Do you know the question for today

#s8
And what is your feeling

#s9
Do you think this is vital important

#s11
Okay

#s12
Do you

#s19
I It I have worked in some campaigns

#s20
and it 's the most discouraging thing in the world

#s21
I 'm originally from Oklahoma

#s22
and up there if they miss three elections then they have to reregister

#s23
And I have often wondered if if maybe that would help the situation

#s24
I do n't know

#s26
Well can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people

#s32
Oh that 's all right

#s38
Well

#s40
I 'm I 'm not sur-

#s41
the only thing is if they do n't vote they have no right to complain

#s43
It is um

#s44
I do n't know why we are so complacent

#s45
but I 'm going to vote each time

#s46
Right or wrong I 'm going to cast a ballot

#s47
and then if I 'm unhappy with it I have the right to express my opinion

#s49
So uh there was something else I was going to

#s50
and I 'm like you

#s51
I 've just lost a train of thought that I had

#s52
But they have been more little more s- effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it

#s54
No

#s55
three

#s57
You have to you have to skip three

#s59
And uh of course those can be they can be oh a long time apart

#s60
but um

#s62
Of course

#s63
what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting

#s66
Okay

#s67
I 'm sure all over the State of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting

#s69
And you do n't have to h- be sick out of town or anything

#s70
They there is no excuse

#s71
Anyone can go and vote

#s74
Do you

#s79
But that is an excuse and that would I could live with

#s81
But this idea of anyone wel-

#s82
I ju- I am so bitterly opposed to this

#s83
If you 're busy that has always been a legitimate excuse

#s84
If you are incapacitated ill health

#s86
but to have the expense of

#s87
let 's see

#s88
They have five six people at my polling place

#s89
They can come from all over the city

#s90
and I do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this

#s92
Yes

#s93
I know

#s95
But is there is every list checked as thoroughly as a

#s96
you know We

#s97
back in

#s98
when I lived
