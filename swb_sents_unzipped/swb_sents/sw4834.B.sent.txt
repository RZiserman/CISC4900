#s2
No

#s3
not really

#s4
Uh u- th- uh th- the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls

#s6
That 's the only thing that bothers me

#s7
That 's not really invading my privacy

#s9
Uh do you feel that yours is invaded

#s21
But but that does n't work

#s23
Uh no

#s24
because they a lot of times they dial sequentially

#s25
They get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything

#s27
Uh you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something

#s28
you put your phone number on there

#s29
they pass your phone number on to another company

#s31
Uh or you uh

#s32
or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or s- and stuff

#s33
They even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe

#s34
And uh while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they

#s36
you call me one more time I 'm going to stop subscribing

#s37
And the lo- local local papers MUMBLEx ask them to remove your na- number from their list

#s38
and uh yeah

#s39
you call up their regular during regular hours

#s40
their uh they have a special department

#s41
they 'll take your numbers out of their lists

#s43
Uh but the uh Orlando paper uh yeah they they refused to take it off of the lists

#s44
and they call every month

#s46
And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have

#s52
Uh-huh

#s58
Uh-huh

#s60
Uh-huh

#s62
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
If you know a person 's social security number and their mailing address i- and their mother 's maiden name uh you can basically become that uh person

#s68
Uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to

#s70
and since it was n't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it was n't her

#s71
Uh if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would ha- whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of uh you know document

#s73
and uh wh-

#s74
the signature uh

#s75
they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature

#s76
and if they ca n't provide a signature you know they 'll have to eat the charge

#s79
But if the pers- has you know their social s- her social security number I 'd be real concerned that they uh that she 's not uh blacklist on uh Tel- what is it it 's Telecredit or something

#s81
Uh because she wo n't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there

#s82
She probably wo n't be ab- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
