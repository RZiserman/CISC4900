#s5
Oh yes

#s6
I have two boys who are twenty-eight and twenty-four and a daughter who is twelve

#s10
Yes

#s11
Same husband everything

#s13
Uh but

#s17
Uh-huh

#s21

#s25
Are are you down here in Texas

#s28
Oh

#s29
Okay

#s30
yeah

#s31
You know what I meant with rain huh

#s34
Oh

#s36
Okay uh

#s37
what

#s42
Yeah

#s43
I I have

#s44
can you hold on just a sec-

#s46
I have to answer a business phone

#s48
I hate to do it on this call

#s50
Good morning

#s51
A R E

#s52
this is Arlene Lister

#s53
It was just a recorded message on our business phone anyway

#s54
I 'm sorry

#s55
keep going

#s60
Uh-huh

#s62
Yeah

#s63
Well there there was not nearly as much of it

#s64
In fact I I think things were were quite a bit different

#s66
Uh when my my big kids were were little uh you know ev- ev- all the mothers were home

#s68
You know the the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around

#s69
and then when they felt like it they went out to play you know when they were were little like that

#s72
And uh I I think it 's gotten uh very different

#s73
When my second one was little they were coming out with SESAME STREET which he started watching

#s75
and other than that I mean there was basically there was not educational T V

#s76
or uh you know you got some cartoons

#s78
and that was it

#s79
but they they were never that interested in it anyway

#s80
They 'd rather I mean they 'd take their trucks out in the backyard you know go out and play and stuff

#s82
But we always did uh oh just you know to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum

#s84
We did a lot of stuff like that with uh with our kids

#s86
And course when they got bigger uh they were both quite into sports

#s87
and and you know so whatever you know they would do we 'd go along with

#s90
and uh uh a girl is very different

#s91
We have

#s92
a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping

#s94
So they 're very very different

#s95
but uh y-

#s96
kind of the same thing our you know

#s97
she now

#s98
lot of time spent with her she 's so busy is uh you know going to you know

#s100
like last night was a band concert

#s102
and she plays on her school volleyball team and uh stuff like that

#s103
But uh we we still uh oh like to pack up you know just go someplace for the day or uh you know just stuff like that

#s105
One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station

#s107
so that 's uh

#s108
we go down there fairly often you know for a weekend for you know family get-togethers and stuff like that

#s110
Uh

#s114
Uh-huh

#s118
Oh yes

#s119
Yeah

#s120
I I think our kids just always dearly loved that you know play bounce the ball or just uh

#s122
course when our big ones were little we lived up north you know

#s124
and this time of the year it it the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves you know

#s126
So You know so it 's it 's very different

#s129
and and uh you know we also come winter time we 'd stick them on sleds

#s130
And uh we had a pond across the street

#s132
and and from little on you know

#s133
I 'm

#s134
it 's it 's so different down here where y- you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something

#s135
You know when our kids were little you you got them a pair of skates
