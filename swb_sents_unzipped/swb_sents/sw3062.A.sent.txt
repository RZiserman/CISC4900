#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Now is he the elementary school

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
But he is being helped

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Oh great

#s22
No

#s23
that 's something new to me

#s24
I 'm

#s27
Oh

#s29
I think I read about that in the paper

#s31
Doctor Haggard is is heading that up

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Oh

#s42
Right

#s43
so you worked you learned how to solve your problems on your own

#s47
Has has he had this since kindergarten

#s48
or is this something that maybe learning phonetics

#s49
and then he just did n't learn the right way

#s52
Uh-huh

#s60
Okay

#s63
You 're right right

#s66
Right

#s71
Good

#s72
good

#s73
that 's great for parents to be involved

#s78
Oh how great

#s81
So she she was able to zero in

#s83
Oh

#s88
Huh

#s90
Uh-huh

#s91
uh-huh

#s98
Right

#s99
Oh no

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
uh-huh

#s105
Right

#s106
but that 's something that parents I think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child

#s108
So because that 's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home

#s111
but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult

#s113
and this is this to me is the benefit I see in public schools is that that uh you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs that these students need

#s117
and I 'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem

#s118
they test kids before they take them

#s121
and if they 're a behavior problem they 're out

#s123
That

#s124
and and uh this is kind of a rejection type of thing

#s127
and and we get it even at our level in in

#s128
I work a nine ten school

#s129
and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the uh parochial and pub- and uh private schools

#s131
and uh they come in

#s132
and their attitude is I 'm a bad boy

#s133
and proceed to prove it

#s136
So I I really hate that for them

#s137
I I would rather they not have that attitude

#s139
but that 's

#s143
Right

#s145
That 's right

#s148
Uh-huh

#s151
No

#s153
That 's right

#s154
they can be selective

#s155
right

#s160
Right

#s162
If you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the pri- to the private school group then I think you would have a more equitable way

#s164
And I have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here

#s165
In in in uh ho- honesty the kids in Japan are they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they 're going to get into

#s167
and then after uh

#s168
and if if you only

#s169
the in fact they 've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably wo n't get into the top elementary and and high school

#s171
and if they do n't then af- when they reach a certain age they just that 's the end of their schooling

#s173
And and uh they do n't ever really go on

#s174
It 's only their top ones that go on like ours do

#s177
And and uh so that that creates a problem

#s178
And and you ca n't compare because they go so many more hours

#s180
The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child 's education and is that child

#s183
That 's right

#s186
That 's right

#s187
that 's right

#s192
Better coping skills

#s193
Yes

#s199
Right

#s202
Right

#s205
Well and you do n't you do n't see the parents uh encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band

#s209
it 's strictly stick to the educational

#s210
and it 's interesting to see them as they get older uh

#s211
then that is the type of adult they are

#s213
Um
