Okay

#s2
I guess our topic is um advice about going to college

#s4
Do you have children of your own

#s8
Oh are you

#s10
What school are you going to

#s12
Oh Are you enjoying it

#s14
Are you working on your um Bachelor 's degree

#s17
And what field of study are you in

#s19
Uh-huh

#s21
Oh well that 's neat

#s22
Are you from North Carolina

#s25
Oh are you really

#s27
Oh Well what took you to North Carolina

#s29
Oh I see

#s31
Well that was one of the things I was thinking about in school um

#s32
I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock

#s33
and uh I had a friend

#s34
my roommate went to Tech also

#s36
but she was from New Mexico

#s38
and she had to pay out of state tuition

#s40
and I think that would have uh played a real big part of my decision

#s42
yeah

#s43
because um she was pay-

#s44
of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now

#s45
It was like four dollars a semester hour

#s47
and so I was going to school for you know just a few hundred dollars a semester

#s48
and she was paying forty dollars an hour

#s50
so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state

#s53
Oh that 's good

#s54
Yeah

#s55
so I think that would be one thing I would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that um I liked well enough to attend

#s59
Uh-huh

#s60
Right

#s61
yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s64
right

#s67
Yeah

#s68
that 's true

#s69
that was something else I had was I had government aid of course

#s70
but uh it was wonderful because I got one of those grants that you do n't have to repay

#s72
and yeah

#s73
it was so nice

#s75
it paid most of my tuition and um a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing

#s76
so

#s78
Yeah

#s79
I really

#s81
I 'm sorry

#s82
what did you say

#s84
Well it was called a B E O G a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant

#s86
and it was from the government

#s87
and it was based at first it was based on my parents ' income

#s88
My parents had five children and really did n't make enough money to send any of us to school

#s90
And so uh because based on the number of children and the amount of money uh my father brought in I got a small grant

#s92
but then after that I was on my own working and you know trying to go to school on my own

#s93
So then I got a real big grant because the amount of money I was making really did n't compare

#s96
So it was kind of nice

#s98
I do n't know if those are still available or not

#s99
but

#s103
Yeah

#s104
yeah

#s105
this was great

#s106
it was just based on you know how much your tuition costs and everything

#s107
and generally it paid everything

#s108
so I went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing

#s110
so that was

#s112
Yeah

#s113
it was really nice

#s116
Uh-huh

#s118
Right

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
Yeah

#s124
Uh-huh

#s125
Uh-huh

#s127
That 's right

#s130
Um I did n't know that

#s132
Um Well I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was between a a Christian college because I thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech

#s135
and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech

#s136
Um

#s137
the Christian college was so much more expensive

#s138
But I guess some of the other smaller colleges might might be a lot different

#s140
Really

#s142
Yeah

#s146
Yeah huh

#s148
Yeah

#s149
yeah

#s150
you 're just a number

#s153
Right

#s155
Yeah

#s158
Oh that 's a shame

#s159
Well I I felt a little cheated at Tech also

#s160
Once I got into my

#s161
I um majored in
