#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh-huh

#s16
Uh-huh

#s18
Huh

#s19
Well I I work for uh actually probably similar kind of place

#s20
I work for uh Lincoln Laboratory

#s22
Uh yeah

#s23
We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech

#s26
Uh and uh

#s27
so we 're we 're part we 're actually part of M I T

#s28
So it 's very much the same kind of place and uh the technical institution

#s31
Uh while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a and a job I guess uh MUMBLEx list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that

#s34
I do n't know

#s35
What are your uh what sorts of things would you consider important

#s37

or

#s74
Uh-huh

#s78
Uh-huh

#s80

#s83

#s84
I 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that

#s85
I think uh back about a few years ago when things were tough Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile

#s86
They went to a uh a a four and a half day work week rather than cut yeah just cut everybody back ten percent And uh have to give everybody a half day a week off

#s90
