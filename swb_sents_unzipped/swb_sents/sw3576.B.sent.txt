Let 's see

#s2
my husband does the majority of the um the uh gardening uh taking care of the lawn and fertilizing

#s3
but I um tend to all the planting the annuals and and the spraying and um taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in you know throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um any kind of decorating for the holidays you know

#s5
I 'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas

#s6
but basically he does all the heavy stuff

#s7
and I do all the fun stuff

#s12
Uh-huh

#s13
I see

#s16
Wow

#s17
Wow That 's a a big job

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s29
Oh sure

#s30
Oh I bet it 's beautiful

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Wild flowers

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
Oh that sounds lovely

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Oh the wild flowers are beautiful

#s45
I think um I was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the kids um just way in the back behind the swing sets

#s46
or just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty

#s47
Then you do n't really have to have much maintenance involved

#s50
Uh-huh

#s53
Uh-huh

#s54
I know a lot of

#s56
uh-huh

#s57
a lot of women do Um

#s58
I 've just never really you know

#s59
maybe one of these days I 'll have to get out there and mow

#s60
but um my husband takes on

#s61
and I 'll help rake up the grass

#s62
and um sometimes I 'll help him edge um

#s63
because we do n't have that much property

#s64
but we 're on a corner lot

#s65
so there 's a lot of edging to do

#s67
and um uh that 's what 's nice about living more in the country

#s68
you do n't have to worry about any of that

#s70
Oh

#s71
Oh that 's nice

#s72
I

#s73
this is different for us because the other

#s74
the past we 've had homes that have n't had any side walks

#s75
and um it 's been a little more country with the trees

#s76
and we do miss that

#s77
Um if we had a chance to move I think we 'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as as far as that goes

#s81
Uh-huh

#s85
Oh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
Wow that 's

#s90
Um

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Right

#s95
Right

#s96
Well I put

#s99
Uh-huh

#s102
Uh-huh

#s104
Oh

#s105
Oh that sounds so pretty

#s107
Oh really

#s108
Do they do n't do any damage though

#s109
they just fly right back out if you have the

#s112
I see

#s114
I see

#s117
Uh-huh

#s121
Uh-huh

#s123
Oh oh that sounds wonderful

#s125
Oh I love home gro- grown tomatos

#s127
There 's nothing like them

#s128
They just do n't have the same ones in the supermarket

#s130
What does that mean accidental tomatoes

#s133
Uh-huh

#s135
I see
