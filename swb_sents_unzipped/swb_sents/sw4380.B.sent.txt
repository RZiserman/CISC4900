#s3
Uh-huh

#s5
Really

#s6
Yeah

#s7
I feel that my uh

#s8
I 'm a junior in college now

#s9
And I go to Tech Georgia Tech

#s13
And I

#s17
Okay

#s18
Uh I 've

#s19
the high school I went to was uh was a good one also

#s20
And I well I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools

#s21
Because the one I went to was you know I 'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta

#s25
Yeah

#s31
What

#s33
Yeah

#s34
that 's true

#s36
Yeah

#s37
And I 'm also

#s38
I mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that More than they would you know in areas where they

#s39
yeah

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Yeah

#s45
That 's true

#s47
Right

#s52
Yeah

#s54
That 's hard for me to say since I did n't I did n't really grow

#s55
well when I went to elementary school it it was n't in a great area

#s56
but I still I mean I learned to read started learning to read when I was in kindergarten you know

#s58
So I guess I ca n't really I ca n't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed region

#s61
You know I guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the MUMBLEx people

#s65
So I guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to uh to get some kind of motivation to learn

#s66
and

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s73
Uh-huh

#s76
No

#s77
I I ca n't say that I have either

#s78
But uh

#s81
Yeah

#s82
I 've I 've heard some I mean I 've heard sta- sta- statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education I mean within like within the same uh income groups

#s84
If you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private schools

#s86
I think they compare fair- you know fairly well

#s91
Yeah

#s92
I I I my schools I mean there

#s93
I have a lot of

#s94
once once it seemed I got into high school they had a lot of uh MUMBLEx accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that

#s96
That I mean that makes a big difference

#s97
cause I wondered when they 're taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that

#s104
Uh-huh
