#s4
Yeah

#s5
I have some friends of mine who use Quicken

#s6
and uh I 've considered using it once myself

#s7
but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date

#s9
So I I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Yeah

#s15
well it 's similar problems

#s16
but uh we just have the one check book

#s17
and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible

#s18
and occasionally we will get behind like you say

#s19
but uh it does n't really seem to be too too tight if we just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced

#s21
Well how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
Yeah

#s28
Well that 's pretty good if you can do that

#s29
I know

#s30
I have a daughter who 's ten

#s31
and we have n't really put much away for her college up to this point

#s32
but uh we 're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college

#s34
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall

#s36
and then the money that I will be making this summer we 'll be putting away for the college fund

#s43
Uh-huh

#s46
Uh-huh

#s48
Well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job

#s49
well almost full time

#s51
So it 's only recently that we 've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing

#s55
Oh Stockton

#s57
How about you

#s62
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh a colleague of mine at uh work got some information over uh the computer network called INTERNET

#s70
And he just forwarded that on to me

#s71
and uh it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in

#s73
so I sent back MUMBLEx mail

#s77
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s83
Well what other long range goals do you have besides college

#s85
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh
