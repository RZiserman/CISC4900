Well uh guess it 's logical to ask do you exercise any

#s4
I 'm about the same way

#s5
I I do a little bit

#s6
My job kind of hinders me from exercising

#s7
I 'm a night operator here at a industry down here

#s8
and I do n't really get out a lot to because my job to to exercise

#s13
Right

#s16
It is

#s18
That 's that 's the way I feel

#s19
I 'm used to being in pretty good shape because when I was in high school I stayed in pretty good shape played a little basketball and stuff like that

#s20
but I 've got

#s21
now I 'm in college

#s22
and I go to school during the day and work at night

#s23
I can tell that I 've not really done a whole lot

#s27
Well uh I usually I usually play at home

#s28
We live out in the country

#s29
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play

#s30
or a lot of times we 're we 're up at the church

#s31
we 'll play volleyball

#s32
stuff like that

#s34
Oh really

#s37
Oh the SWEATING TO THE OLDIES

#s41
Oh really

#s44
Right

#s46
Right

#s47
I 'll

#s49
Oh really

#s53
Right

#s54
that 's the way I am

#s55
I just want to sit down and relax

#s56
Too tired to exercise

#s57
I did

#s60
I started riding my bike about a couple of months ago

#s61
and I 'd ride about two or three miles a day

#s62
but but it would last about a couple of weeks

#s63
and it got real cold for a little while

#s64
so I gave it up

#s66
Walk around

#s69
Right

#s70
Right

#s71
I 've noticed people doing that down here too

#s72
I 'll be in town or something

#s73
and people will walk around the mall

#s75
It it is fairly safe

#s78
Yeah

#s79
certain parts of it

#s82
Right

#s83
Right

#s84
I used to do a lot of swimming

#s85
we have we have a swimming pool

#s86
but it 's an old concrete pool

#s87
We 've been having trouble with it the past few years

#s88
so we have n't got to use it much

#s89
but I love to swim and water ski and stuff like that

#s92
Right

#s98
Right

#s99
you ca n't do it year round

#s101
Right

#s102
that 's the way ours is

#s104
Oh no

#s105
it 's too cold

#s108
I could deal with a hot tub

#s109
Those are nice

#s111
I 'm from Laurel

#s113
That 's way down towards the south

#s114
Not quite on the coast

#s115
but we 're about two hours from the coast

#s118
Yes ma'am

#s119

#s120
