Okay

#s2
well what do you do on your yard

#s5
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s11
Comes back in the yard

#s13
so you do n't have any one do your yard

#s14
You do it yourself

#s16
Yeah

#s17
we do too

#s19
Is n't that the truth

#s20
A flyer 's on every door every day

#s23
That 's right

#s24
Well we um we my husband does the same thing

#s25
he does the yard

#s26
and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower

#s27
but I keep putting off learning

#s29
That 's right

#s30
But I had recently gone out and planted mums

#s31
We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago

#s32
and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway 's

#s34
and put out yellow and bronze

#s35
and they 're just gorgeous

#s36
and so then last week my mom comes in town

#s37
and she says Well those are going to die just the first frost

#s38
She said You should have done pansies

#s39
And I went Well now you tell me

#s41
So the first night that around Halloween

#s42
and we went out and covered them with a sheet

#s43
and they did okay that first night

#s44
But the second night we were at the movies and did n't do it

#s45
so I guess I 've lost them

#s46
I have n't gone out to check yet

#s50
No

#s51
listen

#s52
but um the worst problem we 've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here

#s53
I guess it was about four years ago

#s54
And we did not know in August to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms

#s56
And the next spring I guess in that March every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we 'd have big whole patches come up

#s57
Have you ever seen it what grub worms do

#s60
And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it

#s61
it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt

#s62
So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything

#s63
It took a lot of money and a lot of time

#s64
so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon

#s67
Oh yeah

#s68
we found them

#s70
yeah

#s71
we found them

#s72
We dug under there about an inch

#s73
and you could see them

#s74
They 're real fat little white things

#s75
and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring

#s79
yeah

#s80
but in but in the

#s81
Uh-huh

#s83
Yeah

#s84
June bugs is what I 'd heard them called

#s85
so any how occasionally I find them in the flower beds

#s86
They said that every yard has some

#s88
but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem

#s89
So that 's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before

#s93
Oh yeah

#s94
that too

#s95
two years ago or last Christmas

#s96
is that what you 're talking about

#s102
Yeah

#s103
uh-huh

#s104
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s108
Oh yeah

#s109
I guess you did too

#s110
It 's what they 've done in the spring or the fall

#s114
Yeah

#s115
because I started to say you can there 's different times they say it 's okay to do it

#s118
Yeah

#s120
Yeah

#s122
keep it damp

#s123
Well my

#s124
out here you know we do n't have as many trees in Plano

#s125
at least the area where

#s126
we 're over by Collin Creek Mall

#s127
and but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died

#s128
and all those variegated uh things died

#s129
So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly

#s130
and they just live

#s133
Yeah

#s134
you can you can stand those

#s136
Uh-huh

#s139
Yeah

#s141
Well it 's kind of like one of these

#s143
Same way

#s144
uh-huh

#s145
That they they warned me of that one finally

#s146
And I said You know you need to either read Neal Sperry 's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there

#s147
and we did n't know the difference

#s148
And every year we learn one more thing that we did n't know before Like about these mums

#s150
Okay

#s151
next year I 'll do pansies

#s153
And my backyard we had it really nice

#s154
and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy

#s155
and so it was about

#s156
I guess he 's three now

#s157
so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio

#s161
So it 's like our backyard is just kind of like

#s162
as long as he wo n't damage it fine

#s163
and if he 'll if there 's anything he 'll hurt we just do n't put it out there any more

#s167
Uh-huh

#s168
Very much

#s169
but uh

#s171
You did

#s174
Huh

#s175
Uh-huh

#s177
So do ours

#s178
yeah

#s180
What did you grow

#s183
That is amazing

#s185
Yeah

#s187
Well put them in a salad though

#s188
and you say well I made it though

#s189
at least it 's mine
