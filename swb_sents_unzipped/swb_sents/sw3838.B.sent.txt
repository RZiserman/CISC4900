Well if you 're from Iowa you must be very artsy crafty

#s3
Everyone I 've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands

#s7
I did n't know anyone ever moved from California to Kan- Iowa

#s13
I 'm teasing only because I 'm from Indiana

#s15
I really like I like the Midwest

#s17
But I married a Texan

#s18
and they have a way of dragging you back home

#s19
Anyway we 're supposed to be talking about crafts

#s20
Do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands like knitting or

#s26
Oh you do a lot then

#s27
Do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching

#s31
Um actually I I 'm pretty untalented

#s33
I used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um

#s34
but I I do n't know

#s35
somehow I do n't have the time anymore

#s36
But I have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their uh bags some their most recent uh needle craft

#s38
and in December everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings

#s43
Yes

#s46
Is this your first baby

#s48
Have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets

#s56
Did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself

#s57
or how did you make a quilt

#s61
Uh-huh

#s64
But you actually hand quilted it yourself

#s67
Did did you need a loom

#s68
or were you a-

#s69
was it small enough that you could just hold it

#s72
Uh-huh

#s75
But um my again my mother back in Indiana

#s76
we had a quilting frame in our basement

#s77
and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself

#s79
Um yes

#s80
which

#s81
I was always amazed

#s82
I have one of them Um

#s83
but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it 's a tremendous amount of work

#s87
Oh you think children

#s88
you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children

#s90
I think when babies

#s91
I think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and are are wonderful

#s92
And and they 'll wear them

#s95
Once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them

#s102
Oh yes

#s103
I think it 's very clever

#s104
It 's uh funny that you said

#s105
For Christmas my daughter and I received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for us

#s106
A beautiful Christmas design

#s108
and they were matching

#s109
and they were lovely

#s110
but when I washed them although I took the precaution of turning them inside out I really did n't do anything else And truly everything fell off or most of it

#s114
So I had I went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back

#s115
and I bought the paint and redid most of the edges

#s117
and and it was salvageable

#s118
and I

#s119
but it 's

#s120
so I 'm familiar with that

#s121
but I think you 're very clever to um sew around the edges

#s122
I think gluing alone certainly if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges
