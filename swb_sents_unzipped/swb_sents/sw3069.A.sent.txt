#s1
Yeah

#s2
Yes

#s3
I talked with um I talked with people from Richardson and Plano

#s4
and uh the first three days

#s5
and then yesterday I talked with someone with from Pennsylvania

#s6
so

#s9
it 's the

#s12
Oh

#s15
Oh I know

#s16
Sometimes I just

#s17
I 'm in

#s18
it just takes a very long time

#s19
so

#s24
Yeah

#s25
I know

#s27
Well

#s28
This is hilarious

#s31
Oh Well tell me

#s32
what books have you read lately

#s39
Well I do n't read all that much for enjoyment

#s40
I mean I read a lot for school

#s41
but gee I just do n't have much time for enjoyment reading

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
Um

#s47
Yeah

#s50
Huh

#s52
Oh yeah

#s54
Oh yeah

#s56
Interesting

#s59
Uh-huh

#s60
Yes

#s61
yes

#s62
yeah

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
Yeah

#s66
Yeah

#s67
That kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for wh- when a lot of books like that were coming out I think

#s69
And so that makes real sense that that 's um when it was written

#s72
Um I have n't was n't really aware that she had written anything for um adults

#s73
I was always just more aware of her jer- you know

#s75
for her young people her books

#s78
Uh-huh

#s80
I 'll be darned

#s82
Yeah

#s85
Uh-huh

#s87
Yeah

#s88
Right

#s89
yeah

#s90
yeah

#s93
Yeah

#s94
I wonder if she 's written anything really recently if she 's got anything printed in print

#s98
Uh-huh

#s100
I 'll be darned

#s102
Yeah

#s104
Yeah

#s106
Well it 's

#s107
I 'm trying to think the last actual book I read that was n't

#s108
let 's see

#s109
I think I read oh

#s110
when I was on vacation um between semester break and summer you know on semester break between spring and summer

#s112
and I went to my mother 's

#s113
I read a book that I have should have read when I was probably in high school

#s114
I read um JANE EYRE

#s116
No

#s117
wait a minute

#s118
wait a minute

#s119
wait a minute

#s120
JANE EYRE

#s121
No

#s122
no

#s123
no

#s124
no

#s125
it was n't JANE EYRE

#s127
No

#s128
it was um uh PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen

#s132
That 's what it was

#s133
yes

#s135
And um you know I I did n't know what to expect except I had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist

#s136
and she really was good

#s137
I mean I was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately

#s139
and um and you know I just

#s140
but I as I say I was pretty much ashamed that I had n't read something before then

#s143
Uh-huh

#s145
Yeah

#s146
yeah

#s148
Uh-huh

#s150
Oh how interesting

#s152
Yeah

#s155
Oh I 'll bet

#s156
yeah

#s158
Yeah

#s160
Right

#s161
I would n't be surprised

#s163
yeah

#s164
Sure

#s165
Oh yeah

#s167
Well I read that

#s168
and then I 'm trying to think

#s169
um usually I try to to find something long that I 'm going to

#s171
when if if I have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when I know I 'm not going to be doing anything for a while um

#s174
Yeah

#s175
and that 's about it because otherwise I 'm reading so much for school

#s176
I 'm um I have just started reading a book

#s177
Actually it 's for school

#s178
but it 's for um

#s179
there 's a a literary jour-

#s180
well not a literary journal

#s181
it 's a it 's kind of a journal of of the history of ideas that 's that 's starting to be published um from U T D

#s182
The first issue does n't come out until next year

#s183
but um

#s185
I 'm doing some reviews of books just to what to sort of recommend to whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal

#s187
and I 've

#s188
yeah

#s189
it 's really neat because these are brand new books

#s190
and I just got a I got a th- this one

#s192
um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that

#s195
This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach

#s196
and it 's a a a biography that is really interesting

#s199
I mean it it 's fascinating

#s200
it really is

#s202
Um but it 's so long

#s203
I I do n't really have the time to read the whole thing

#s204
but I think eventually I 'll go back to it

#s206
But it 's it was written

#s208
I mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety-one

#s209
so it 's a brand new book

#s211
Yeah

#s212
uh-huh

#s214
Yeah

#s215
and he really this man really shed some light on um some aspects of of Bach 's genius and and and you know the and more sociological things you know like the the idea that um that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything

#s217
I mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians

#s221
Yeah

#s222
that 's right

#s223
Yes

#s224
uh-huh

#s225
and um

#s228
Yeah

#s229
So uh

#s232
it was just really interesting

#s233
if that 's you know that 's kind of what

#s234
but I have to

#s235
not only am am I re- reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisers for this um journal does n't have right now does n't have a really respected name um who 's a uh a scholar on on music

#s237
um and I 'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board

#s238
so

#s240
I do n't know if I want to take that responsibility or not

#s241
but But at least I can tell them what I think

#s244
so um it 's real interesting

#s248
Yeah

#s249
it is

#s250
Uh-huh

#s251
Yeah

#s252
yeah

#s254
Yes

#s255
Yeah

#s257
that it

#s258
you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that

#s260
right

#s261
uh-huh

#s263
because it attracts really a a lot people 's interest

#s264
That 's one way

#s265
it 's really good public relations for small schools

#s267
I think so

#s269
But uh another one of my projects this summer is actually it 's part of my research assistantship is um it 's helping a professor uh compile a bunch of translations of of various poems for a book that he 's writing

#s270
and so I 'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people

#s274
Um well where where for instance um a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people

#s278
And the translations are all so different from one another

#s280
Uh-huh

#s282
So it 's multiple translations of single works

#s283
and and that 's right now right now pretty much what I 'm doing as far as um

#s284
my work is just kind of compiling all that for him

#s286
So

#s288
It 's real interesting

#s292
Oh well let me tell you

#s293
There are days when I would be prefer really doing that

#s296
I do n't know if I 've told you

#s297
but um this is not on the subject
