So you have a child two years old in child care right now

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Uh

#s10
Yes

#s11
our first

#s12
and he just turned three months

#s14
So we 're just starting into hunting for child care

#s16
Right now both of us are students

#s19
Uh

#s20
Uh University of Southern Mississippi

#s22
Uh she 's

#s24
Yeah

#s27
Uh probably Uh

#s28
actually spring semester a year from now he 's going to have to be in child care f- uh five days a week more than likely Uh depending on how my class schedule runs

#s30
because my wife will be doing her internship that semester

#s32
It will be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing

#s34
So depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four si- anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point

#s35
Right now we 're trying to avoid it

#s36
but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him

#s37
Uh I get out of class at certain time

#s38
and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class

#s39
You know once a day this overlap happens where we ca n't one of us be home

#s42
So for about twenty min- twenty thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
Yeah

#s53
Uh-huh

#s56
Uh-huh

#s58
Yeah

#s63
Uh-huh

#s65
Yeah

#s67
Uh that makes a big difference

#s69
Yes

#s73
Yeah

#s77
There 's a lot of child care available

#s78
but invariably there 's waiting lists

#s81
And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university 's uh uh department of uh uh their Home Ec Department

#s85
uh they uh they have a subbranch uh American Family Counseling

#s86
and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus

#s87
But uh they have a pretty good size waiting list

#s89
So

#s92
Uh-huh

#s95
Yeah

#s98
Yeah

#s100
Well it 's best

#s101
Yeah

#s102
a cottage industry 's the best way to do it really

#s104
because if you over

#s106
Uh-huh

#s107
Yeah

#s108
Yeah

#s111
Uh-huh

#s113
Yes

#s114
And it 's amazing how much good things like uh Sesame Street will do

#s116
