#s3
Yes

#s6
Uh yes

#s7
I 'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts

#s9
And I camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend

#s10
and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year

#s12
I 'd say I camp quite a bit

#s18
Well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping

#s20
and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us

#s22
and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the um sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again

#s26
How about yourself

#s33
Well that 's good

#s38
Uh-huh

#s42
Great

#s44
What uh what kind of camping do they like best

#s45
Do they like it where they have tents

#s46
and uh do they cook on stoves

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah

#s58
It does n't get very cold in Texas

#s59
so lots of times we do n't even take tents

#s61
We just use trail tarps

#s63
Uh it 's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh like a uh

#s66
they 're very light weight

#s67
and we use them when we go backpacking

#s68
So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles

#s69
then uh

#s70
they 're not very heavy see

#s72
so you carry them with you

#s73
and they 'll keep you dry or whatever

#s82
Uh-huh

#s84
Ye- yes

#s85
in fact uh um last month we went camping

#s86
we saw a lot of deer uh in the morning and the afternoon

#s87
just deer everywhere

#s91
Uh-huh

#s92
so uh but it even though uh it was n't hunting season

#s93
and we were with Boy Scouts

#s94
so of course we do n't uh want to go hunting

#s96
But we got to see a lot of deer um out and about

#s98
and there 's

#s99
of course we see smaller animals all the time

#s100
and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food 's put away and so forth because uh we have uh armadillos

#s102
Do you know what armadillo is

#s107
And possums and uh raccoons

#s109
And we have those creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a midnight snack

#s111
And so that that uh that can be a problem if you do n't put all your equipment away

#s113
They will if you attack them

#s115
But most time they run away from you if they if they see you 're up you know

#s118
but they do n't have any problem walking right by you if you 're asleep

#s120
So
