#s1
Um are you working right now

#s5
Uh

#s6
What kind of what kind of work do you do

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
Oh

#s10
Wh-

#s11
is that how you heard about this thing

#s13
Uh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Me too

#s17
I work at uh the Georgia Tech Research Institute

#s19
Um I 'm a co-op student

#s20
so I work and go to school about halftime

#s21
And uh I really do n't have any job benefits to speak of

#s22
We 're kind of um

#s23
I do n't know

#s24
they just kind of forget us on that end

#s25
We do n't really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really

#s26
so

#s29
Exactly

#s30
Exactly

#s32
What about you

#s38
Huh

#s40
Yeah

#s41
Uh they do that I think if you 're uh research MUMBLEx here

#s42
then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters

#s43
and I think that um they might you know pay for that Pay for the classes and stuff

#s45
but I know they let you they 'll let you decrease how many hours you work by MUMBLEx kind of percentage

#s46
You know they 'll let you work halftime if you want to if you want to finish

#s48
you want to

#s49
Yeah

#s50
They 'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about

#s51
so if you want to get your masters

#s52
and then I think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due

#s53
so that will probably help out

#s56
But Do you get any kind of health care type stuff

#s64
Uh-huh

#s66
Yeah

#s67
Yeah

#s68
I think I mean that 's pretty that 's a pretty important uh part of it there because that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems

#s69
My dad I think my

#s70
I 'm still covered on with my dad 's uh health plan at his where he works

#s71
but it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own

#s76
Uh-huh

#s78
They have

#s83
Well the only I think the I guess the only real um benefit I guess you could say working for me working here besides I mean

#s84
I 'm learning and stuff because I 'm at you know in school

#s86
But there 's there 's some weird law where uh uh student employees working for the government do n't have to pay Social Security tax

#s90
Though that 's about five percent right there

#s92
so

#s96
That 's about the only real bonus

#s98
I have so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid real you know because if I was working somewhere else I 'd have to you know pay an extra five percent or so

#s102
Huh

#s103
Yeah

#s107
Oh yeah

#s109
Uh-huh

#s110
Yeah

#s112
MUMBLEx help a lot

#s113
Yeah

#s114
See around around here it 's like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors

#s116
There 's not there is not a whole lot of you know funded research from

#
