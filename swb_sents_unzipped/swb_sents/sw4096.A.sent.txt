Hello Ann

#s3
Uh the other day I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling

#s5
and uh I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places

#s7
and uh they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste

#s9
Well it 's not too new

#s12
Oh they really did n't propose any solutions

#s13
Actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A

#s15
But he had a lot of uh facts to to give and uh things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down

#s16
and and uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print

#s17
He was talking about uh the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print

#s19
and they could sell it for a while

#s20
They were able to sell it for some amount per ton

#s21
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they 've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away

#s27
Yeah

#s28
We 're doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here

#s30
There 's uh we 've actually got a kind of a nice set up

#s31
We 've got a couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it 's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation

#s33
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside

#s35
So one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it

#s40
Uh-huh

#s44
And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama

#s45
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government

#s46
One was like environmental protection

#s47
and the other one was oh I ca n't remember what

#s48
but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill

#s50
and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing

#s51
he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them

#s53
He came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it 's it 's low weight but it 's high volume

#s54
so it takes up a lot of space

#s56
and there 's almost no energy there 's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling

#s57
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity

#s59
So his solution was to burn plastic Collect it and burn it

#s64
Yeah

#s65
And it 's more than even paper or something like that

#s66
There is more energy in it per pound or whatever

#s67
Well that was he did n't deal with that

#s69
He just said burn it

#s71
He did n't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that

#s72
So it 's not very practical MUMBLEx

#s76
Yeah

#s77
well real interesting

#s79
Uh not too much

#s80
Uh I got a bit

#s81
Actually
