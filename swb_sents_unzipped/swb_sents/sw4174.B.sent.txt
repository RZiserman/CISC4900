Okay

#s3
well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college

#s5
She 's actually at Bible College for this current year

#s7
And uh I guess uh first and foremost it really it 's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program

#s8
and then it comes down to the dollar

#s9
You have to uh

#s10
it 's whether or not you 're a resident for that jurisdiction

#s11
or you know it does

#s13
it comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs

#s16
Uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to

#s22
No

#s23
y-

#s24
the the college

#s25
the the catalogs are sales material

#s27
It does n't matter whether you know they 're they 're selling school

#s30
And uh and true it uh really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school

#s32
Uh I guess there 's a difference in

#s33
here the

#s34
at least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students

#s35
Like they just live in the community

#s37
Uh you know I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well

#s39
and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit

#s43
Uh-huh

#s47
Yeah

#s48
Uh I guess we 're here

#s49
this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh on a small quantity of gas

#s50
our engineering students

#s52
Uh in competitions

#s53
and that 's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school

#s55
Uh whether you you know in one sense whether you 've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you 've got a a spirit of somewhat unkind but producing graduates

#s58
Uh you know as sort of some development and some training uh

#s59
like it 's easy enough to crank out graduates

#s60
but to really challenge them

#s62
and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to how you know what the attitude towards achievement is

#s64
Uh do you uh have anyone that you 're seriously needing to uh feed information to

#s65
I suppose if you 're actually at Georgia Tech as a student you 're a ways away from that

#s71
Right

#s72
Well that 's that 's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well

#s75
Uh you know to

#s76
going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on the p- pa- programs person 's involved in

#s78
and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself

#s80
and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market

#s82
jeez

#s83
if that 's

#s87
Right

#s88
Best training in the world is not going to f- put food on your table

#s90
But uh
