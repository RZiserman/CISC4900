#s2
Well I think they 're kind of ambivalent really

#s3
Uh I just have a feeling that we 've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know

#s6
We we do n't know half the time we do n't know who to support

#s7
That and you know maybe it 's maybe it 's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with with uh countries like that that depend on us so much without you know just telling them running their country for them

#s9
but

#s11
It 's got to be tough

#s12
but I mean uh uh you sure you still have to you know let them know how you feel

#s19
Yeah

#s20
it worries me that uh the economy of so many countries in in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people like the you know like cocaine from Columbia

#s22
and uh you know of course I I 'm sure we have some enemies down there who would n't care what happened to us

#s24
but but that is that 's a tough deal

#s26
and it

#s27
I do n't think that

#s28
maybe I maybe it 's you know I 'm reflecting how I feel about it

#s29
but I have a feeling that we that we really do n't understand basically the the the competing factions in lot of those countries

#s30
and I mean they 've been hammering MUMBLEx for the last you know ten centuries

#s32
and it 's still going on

#s33
and uh we we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how some times

#s39
Yeah

#s45
Yeah

#s46
yeah

#s49
Yeah

#s50
um well I 'm blank on it

#s52
I can see his face MUMBLEx forget his name

#s56
Yeah

#s57
kind of nationalized it for himself

#s62
Yeah

#s63
Dictator

#s66
Yeah

#s68
And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing

#s69
it just

#s70
you know unstable

#s73
Well I think it 's long overdue

#s75
uh I just you know

#s76
there 's so much difference in in the economies of the two countries

#s77
I 'm not you know I have a problem uh with whether it 's going to work or not you know

#s78
there 's uh it seems like there 's

#s79
and I

#s80
this may be unfair to Mexico

#s81
but it seems like there 's a lack of honesty in in foreign policy a lot of the times

#s84
Yeah

#s86
Yeah

#s88
yeah

#s92
I think their their version of the good old boy network going that uh you know has a lot
