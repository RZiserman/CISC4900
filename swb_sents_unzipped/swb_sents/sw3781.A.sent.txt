#s2
Uh-huh

#s3
yeah

#s4
they seem to be a part of life

#s6
Yeah

#s7
how do you use them

#s9
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s23
Yeah

#s24
Uh-huh

#s26
Yeah

#s27
I use a few

#s28
I uh I watched my grandmother go into debt on them

#s30
and so I 've

#s31
and then I guess my mother

#s34
Yeah

#s35
so my mother learned from that

#s36
and I guess she taught me to be very very careful with them

#s37
So basically uh I just keep them

#s38
I use them so that I build up a credit rating you know

#s39
Uh-huh

#s40
But otherwise uh I generally

#s41
and my husband it turns out

#s42
I 've just been married seven months

#s43
but he has the same habit

#s44
and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something

#s45
That 's good

#s46
but we always pay it off right that month so that we do n't pay any service charge

#s47
Oh that 's That 's wonderful

#s48
So that way we keep out of debt

#s49
and we keep on top of what we 're spending

#s53
Yeah

#s54
yeah

#s55
that 's what I feel

#s56
So

#s58
Uh-huh

#s59
It 's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that

#s60
I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill 's going to come

#s61
but sometimes I forget

#s62
and so you know a bill will come in

#s63
and I 'll think oh no I did n't know it was going to be that high

#s64
Uh-huh

#s66
But so far I 've been able to we 've been able to pay it off every time

#s71
Uh-huh

#s76
Uh-huh

#s79
Um

#s81
Yeah

#s82
Have you ever used Discover card

#s85
Yeah

#s86
I 'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off

#s87
but you know

#s89
Uh I think Sears originally put it out

#s90
Okay

#s91
but it 's uh it 's pretty well taken all over the U S now

#s92
I mean uh I 've have n't found many places that do n't take Discover

#s93
And there 's no annual service fee which is good

#s95
You know

#s96
and then uh they also give you they say cash back uh like at the end of the year

#s97
For the amount that I charge I get two dollars back or something

#s99
but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back

#s101
Yeah

#s102
basically

#s106
And I think the service charge is pretty low too

#s107
but I 'm not sure

#s109
Uh-huh

#s113
Uh-huh

#s116
Uh-huh

#s122
Yeah

#s123
I think it 's best to keep the number down that you have

#s125
Yeah

#s126
So

#s129
Uh-huh

#s132
Uh-huh

#s134
Uh-huh

#s136
Yeah

#s137
Well Do you have anything else to say

#s141
Okay

#s142
I do n't think I do either

#s143
so

#s145
well

#s146
Well it was good talking to you

#s148
Okay

#s150
Have a good evening

#s152
Bye-bye
