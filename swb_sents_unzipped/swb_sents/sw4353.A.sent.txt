#s3
Huh

#s4
Do you all have a budget

#s8
Uh-huh

#s13
Yeah

#s16
Uh-huh

#s19
Yeah

#s20
It 's uh

#s23
Yeah

#s24
I usually uh

#s25
my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances

#s26
and of course we 're ju- like ther- like a lot of people

#s27
We just scramble through month to month you know

#s29
And uh

#s31
Uh we have a two income uh family

#s33
She also works

#s35
and uh but she she enjoys it

#s36
and she 's good at it

#s37
Uh if it 's if it 's

#s38
I am kind of uh uh I 'm pretty bad about procrastinating

#s40
and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe

#s43
You know how that goes

#s44
but uh uh if

#s45
she she handles it pretty well

#s46
She uh she writes all the checks you know once a month

#s53
Uh sort of on a peripheral

#s54
She 's uh uh an annuity administrator

#s56
and so she uh she works for an insurance company

#s58
But but she enjoys it

#s59
She likes keeping track of all that stuff

#s60
and uh

#s63
Yeah

#s64
sort of

#s66
And we you know we 've experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh

#s67
but if you know

#s68
you have to keep up with them

#s69
So a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear

#s70
We try to keep our uh our retirement and our savings kind of automated

#s72
so we never see that money

#s73
Just like taken directly

#s77
Yeah

#s80
And that that 's kind of handy

#s81
Yeah

#s82
because if you do n't see it you do n't miss it MUMBLEx

#s85
You do n't spend it

#s88
Yeah

#s91
Uh-huh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s100

#s106
Uh-huh

#s110
Yeah

#s112
Yeah

#s113
It sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do

#s115
Just kind of play it by ear but keep the the deductions you know MUMBLEx

#s121
