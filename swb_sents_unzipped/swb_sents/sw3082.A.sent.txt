Okay

#s3
Well this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we 're going to a family reunion this weekend

#s5
Yeah

#s7
Down at Lake Texoma lodge

#s9
Yes

#s10
this is one that 's uh the Baker family reunion

#s12
and this has been going on at least uh I would say at least twenty-five years or thirty something like that

#s14
Maybe longer than that I 'm going to get back into the fifties sometime

#s16
First time

#s17
I I married into the family

#s18
and the first time I went was about fifty-seven I think

#s20
But uh this one has been well organized

#s21
and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood

#s22
and now it 's Lake Texoma because that 's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to

#s25
Very important because uh you 'll start losing people if it 's too far to go

#s31
Yeah

#s33
Never get them at both places

#s36
Right

#s37
Well listen

#s38
they 've uh they 've had this one

#s39
well it just

#s40
of course over the years it has uh built up as far as the organization is concerned

#s42
but now they uh have a golf tournament on the Saturday

#s44
And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such

#s46
Yeah

#s47
and uh everyone uh they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge

#s48
and everyone brings in food

#s50
and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant

#s51
and uh it really uh has worked out

#s54
Uh generally uh I think it 's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people

#s56
I think normal 's about sixty or seventy

#s60
Oh

#s62
Oh

#s65
Yeah

#s68
Right

#s70
Yeah

#s71
well our family start- reunion started out my wife and I were the kids the newlyweds so to speak

#s73
and now we go

#s74
our children go

#s75
and our grandchildren are going now

#s77
So it 's uh wound up that uh we 're the old folks now

#s80
But um they have various organized

#s81
they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes uh to pitch

#s82
and they organize a baseball game for the kids

#s84
and several people bring boats

#s85
and there 's a place they they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon

#s86
so it it 's a full day

#s88
Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend

#s90
and some just come in for Saturday

#s92
so it uh has worked out quite well

#s93
and it 's a chance to see some of the relatives you do n't see all year long except that once a year

#s102
Yeah

#s103
my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia

#s104
and I think we 've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that

#s105
so That 's just too far away

#s111
Yeah

#s113
It 's an all day drive just to get to this area

#s117
Yeah

#s119
Yeah

#s120
Yeah

#s121
we have

#s122
each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion

#s124
and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president

#s125
We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together

#s126
And it takes a lot of planning and assembling of stuff

#s129
Right

#s130
That 's correct

#s132
Yes

#s133
it is

#s134
I tell you

#s135
I do n't really care for her to be president again

#s137
But that is uh it 's it 's a lot of work

#s138
but it 's a lot of fun

#s140
We 've enjoyed it

#s141
and the grandkids really enjoy it because it 's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma

#s145
Yeah

#s146
and this year they 're all excited

#s147
The show this weekend

#s148
this weekend 's going to be a rock and roll show

#s150
my two grandsons and one of their cousins are are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and t-shirts and such

#s153
So it 's uh it 's going to be exciting for them and for us too

#s156
Oh yes

#s157
there have been some really wild shows put on there

#s158
They uh really get uh into it

#s163
Yeah

#s164
well Oh that generally happens

#s166
Yeah

#s168
Yeah

#s169
well we 've uh had various things over the years uh to raise funds for it

#s171
and again it 's not it 's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such

#s173
but uh they 've come up with

#s175
they 've tried passing the hat

#s176
and they 've had auctions and various things to raise funds

#s177
and uh some people do

#s179
and some people do n't

#s182
Excuse me

#s183
But um anyway that 's the family reunion story

#s185
Okay

#s189
Been nice talking to you

#s190
Bye
