Okay

#s2
So how do you just figure

#s8
Wow

#s10
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
Oh

#s18
Well um I 'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now

#s20
Um when I was a teacher um in Utah I would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that

#s22
and even when it um rained and snowed I just braved it

#s23
and I wore heels anyway

#s25
And

#s30
I know

#s31
it might kill you to go up and walk up to the door

#s33
but you 're going to look nice for the kids

#s36
Oh oh yeah

#s37
Well I need all the height I can get

#s41
Oh yeah

#s42
Uh-huh

#s43
Yeah

#s44
we too Um

#s45
if it was real- it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots

#s46
but then I would change um into heels as soon as I got to my desk

#s48
So um

#s55
Oh

#s62
Oh

#s64
Sure

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
Uh-huh

#s67
Yeah

#s68
Huh Well um

#s70
Yeah um

#s71
the first two years I was in a room where they did n't heat it

#s72
So I did

#s75
Yeah

#s76
and then the third year we um got heating

#s77
so it was nice

#s81
Right

#s82

#s84

#s92

#s99
we we moved to Iowa

#s100
and um I 'm working at a day care right now

#s102
And so the way I dress is really different because I 'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months

#s104
Yeah

#s105
I wear uh tennis shoes and jeans and things that you know are sort of um

#s109
not

#s110
yes

#s111
it does n't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something

#s113
Yeah

#s114
but I never wore jeans because um I thought that was too casual

#s116
For

#s119
Yeah

#s120
really

#s124
Yeah

#s125

#s128
Um oh it there 's some good things about it

#s129
but I 've seen A lot of things I 'm not used to yet um

#s131
