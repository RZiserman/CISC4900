Actually to tell you the truth I think uh jury selection is a uh prime uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh uh finding of uh guilt

#s6
Yeah

#s7
I think there 's a limit on that

#s8
The uh the uh peremptory challenges are limited to I do n't know how many

#s10
but you can

#s14
Um Yeah

#s15
it seems to me I 'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things

#s16
I think I have a severe demeanor or something

#s18
Uh

#s20
But typically you know basic- uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process

#s21
and I suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who is well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice

#s24
Right

#s26
So

#s28
So if you 're a nincompoop on trial you 'd you 'd have to have nincompoops to uh

#s30
Um

#s32
Uh-huh

#s35
Um

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
uh-huh

#s43
Um

#s45
Uh-huh

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Well I suppose you may be right on that

#s50
Matter of fact I 've heard that I 've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that

#s54
Oh is it

#s55
Oh I did n't realize that

#s56
Okay

#s60
Right

#s62
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
So you what you 're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them

#s68
Um

#s72
What about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets

#s74
Oh really

#s76
Like what

#s78
Ri-
