#s3
Uh-huh

#s5
Oh no

#s6
I do n't have any children

#s7
but I 'm still going to college

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
N C State

#s13
Um well it 's a lot of work

#s15
My Bachelor 's

#s16
Uh-huh

#s18
Um it 's actually in computer science

#s20
and I have a special interest in Voice I O

#s23
No

#s24
I 'm actually from Amarillo Texas originally

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Oh um the service

#s30
Yeah

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Ooh

#s41
It would have played a major part in mine

#s46
Uh-huh

#s49
Golly

#s51
Yeah

#s52
luckily I 've paid in state tuition the whole time

#s56
Uh-huh um

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
The second thing is some colleges only offer the uh liberal arts and uh whereas like State they offer engineering courses

#s62
so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to atteck- some um attend somewhere like Tech

#s65
and um aside from the uh

#s66
well some schools may even give you financial aid where another one wo n't

#s71
Oh really

#s74
Um

#s77
Wow that 's great

#s80
Was it a Pell grant

#s83
What kind of grant was it

#s85
Uh-huh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s94
Wow

#s95
Uh-huh

#s97
Um

#s100
Uh I 'm not quite

#s101
there 's there 's a lot of different organizations who uh who do give grants

#s102
but uh I 'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much they you know they generally run

#s109
Uh-huh

#s111
Golly that 's great

#s114
Oh another thing

#s115
I 've got a I 've got a degree from another college

#s117
and uh something that might play a part is the size of the college

#s119
Uh MUMBLEx the smaller schools can give you a lot uh a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools

#s122
in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy

#s123
and and they just give you a teacher 's assistants you know

#s126
instead of a scholar you get a T A

#s128
and uh you do n't get near the uh quality of education

#s129
and as well the uh smaller schools often times do n't cost as much

#s131
Oh yeah

#s133
Uh-huh

#s134
Uh-huh

#s139
Um Oh I at State I think it 's just a waste of somebody 's money to go there

#s141
it 's really a shame because of you know the instruction

#s143
um I 'd rather go to any other college you know in the state

#s144
and I would definitely get my money 's worth

#s145
uh much better than State

#s147
It 's kind of unfortunate because they 've they 've just grown so big that they just do n't care about the students any more

#s151
Yeah

#s152
they 're they 're bent on uh seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much uh how much of the campus they can build up

#s154
and uh

#s156
yeah

#s157
it 's really a bad situation here
