#s1
The way

#s2
I 'll go ahead and start

#s3
the way I work uh the way I dress for work is uh this year nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie

#s5
or I should n't say suit but coat and tie every day

#s7
A a year ago I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group

#s10
Which means kind of a I guess it 's a different set of standards I guess

#s12
So uh I I dress almost the same every day

#s13
I mean pretty much it 's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat

#s16
But it was very different before

#s17
How do you dress

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s25
I understand

#s28
Right

#s30
I understand

#s31
that 's funny

#s32
So does it change

#s34
Your dress

#s35
no

#s38
So or I guess

#s39
do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that

#s42
So back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like

#s44
but probably once a month or so there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit For a customer presentation or something

#s50
Oh I see

#s51
I understand

#s54
Oh Well that 's interesting

#s56
Let 's see uh

#s57
what else about this uh

#s58
it it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two like two or three levels

#s60
That there 's the t- upper management that always wears gray suits And the people that do n't uh

#s62
I would if you if I want to say do n't have power or do n't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research

#s65
and I guess you are

#s67
That we dress in the jeans

#s68
and then there 's kind of the the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing

#s72
But there 's not much

#s74
It 's nice that there 's not a requirement for it

#s79
Oh yeah

#s80
right

#s81
Yeah

#s82
I guess you see those once in a while

#s85
Sure

#s87
Yeah

#s88
That 's right

#s89
that 's right

#s90
I guess they 're the

#s91
is n't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps

#s92
I 'm not even sure what they are

#s94
Oh backless

#s95
all right

#s98
Okay

#s99
so this was n't necessarily a big conversation

#s100
but I think we we did it

#s102
Okay

#s103
and and your name was Lisa

#s105
Great

#s107

#s108

#s109

#s111
Uh well thank you

#s113
