Okay Eric

#s2
Uh are you married

#s3
and do you have a family

#s5
Okay

#s6
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s15
I see

#s16
Uh

#s18
Well that 's basically what we do

#s19
Uh about every every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget

#s20
and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest

#s22
and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks

#s23
I work part time at night

#s25
and he works and my husband works full times days

#s26
and so we have four checks

#s27
but that works out nice because we get paid every week

#s28
and so that does help

#s30
that helps a lot

#s31
And then uh we do n't have a lot ex- extra for extra spending

#s32
so it 's pretty well ear marked

#s35
Yeah

#s37
Yeah

#s38
Every penny is ear marked

#s39
but uh it we have found that works the best

#s40
and and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up

#s41
In fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half

#s42
but and divide those up between all

#s43
uh-huh

#s46
And so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one

#s47
and then the next pay check we 're real short

#s48
or

#s52
That 's true

#s55
Uh-huh

#s59
Yeah

#s61
Well it helps you to focus where your money goes

#s63
and and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget

#s64
but you 're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in

#s65
and then you 're saying my word where did all that money go

#s68
Where does it go

#s70
Uh

#s72
and also we have found that if we write down

#s73
and we did this

#s74
We are not real consistent with this

#s75
but we did it for about a month

#s76
and we wrote down everything that we bought when you know every pay check

#s78
and so we could see where every penny went

#s79
and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend

#s80
and like I say we have n't been real consistent with it

#s81
It 's

#s82
we should cause it does help

#s85
Uh-huh

#s87
Uh-huh

#s89
just stick to that

#s90
uh-huh

#s91
That is

#s92
Yeah

#s93
That that sounds like a really good idea

#s95
And it really helpful

#s96
Uh have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet

#s99
Oh uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s103
Oh that 's good

#s104
That 's a good feeling

#s107
My husband just graduated from the university uh a year ago

#s109
so finally finally we are getting to that point too

#s111
So are you still going to school

#s112
or
