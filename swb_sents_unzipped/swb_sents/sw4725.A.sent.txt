Regarding uh taxes I you know

#s2
taxes are really a necessary evil and in a civilized society

#s3
But really people get upset at taxes because you it 's more efficient to do things yourself

#s5
And uh and so as as a result uh you know it 's it 's a trade-off you know for the common good you know For for the benefit of others you know

#s6
How much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others

#s7
Have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really do n't deserve it

#s12
Well the thing of it is if I wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader I guess I could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know lo- look for uh look for people to uh take care of me

#s15
And uh probably a good woman

#s16
right

#s18
Just you know just just con somebody to take care of me

#s19
And MUMBLEx then you do n't have to be on the tax roll

#s21
But uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing

#s22
and everybody really hates it

#s23
It was very timely

#s24
I I I always over pay my my deductions

#s25
so I wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding

#s27
So uh you know that that 's always a smile

#s28
But of course you know I 've I 've paid it in

#s29
and I should calculate it better

#s32
MUMBLEx

#s33
No

#s34
I I I work for the F B I

#s36
So I I 'm a federal employee

#s38
Yeah

#s39
Guess I do n't sound like it huh

#s44
Yeah

#s45
I belong

#s46
Oh I I 've got all four feet in the trough you know being a federal employee

#s48
And and so but but I can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits

#s49
Like every every time there is a a bond issue you know I vote no on every one of them

#s52
I 'm I

#s53
but there this is this is tax not tax revolt country

#s54
I mean there 's too many

#s55
every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know Plus our snout right up to our ears

#s57
So you know it 's not exactly that kind of a place that that you want to you know get into a tax revolt situation

#s59
But uh uh the uh the local taxes here I I i- in this particular area uh you know I 've uh I think I pay about uh oh thirty-five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know And which is a lot of money

#s61
An- and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing

#s63
and and they they 're building old people 's homes uh you know at tax expense

#s64
Well I think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it 's cheaper

#s65
At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I 'm paying in taxes why I I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right

#s68
You know In in instead it 's it 's the taxes here

#s69
so

#s71
Course I do n't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not you know or Seguin or someplace like that

#s74
But uh there 's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer

#s75
And and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer

#s76
If you 're not going to use them then you want to be in in environment

#s77
That 's a strategy I think tha- that the people have to have to take Is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living You know

#s78
I 'm I 'm five or six MUMBLEx years before I 'm eligible to retire

#s79
and and I 'm saying well you know I really ca n't stay here uh as a retiree

#s82
It 's too expensive

#s84
I 'm going to have go out and you know in you know East Fork someplace And and do my thing you know

#s91
Right

#s92
They they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five you know

#s94
And they 're not doing it a- again you know

#s96
So Well it 's certainly uh uh

#s97
you must be a T I employee

#s99
You must be a T I employee

#s102
You 're not a T I

#s103
who do you work for

#s108
You you 're
