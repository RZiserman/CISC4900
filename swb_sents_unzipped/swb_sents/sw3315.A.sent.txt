Hello

#s3
Hi

#s4
my name is Leslie

#s7
And where are you from

#s9
Oh nice

#s10
I 'm from Dallas Texas

#s12
Yeah

#s13
so

#s15
Well did you understand what this was for you know what it was for what we

#s17
Yeah

#s20
Okay

#s21
I I do n't watch too many

#s22
but we can try it

#s24
Are you ready to start

#s26
Okay

#s27
just a minute

#s30
Yeah

#s31
okay

#s33
Well I do n't really watch too many T V shows other than uh occasionally I 'll I 'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here

#s35
And uh so if if there 's no one else around you know it 's just me and I have a chance to listen to something I 'll turn that on

#s36
but uh just for the for the conversation factor I think

#s37
but and then I think I enjoy when I catch it I do n't even know what night it 's on but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes

#s39
Yeah

#s40
do you

#s43
Yeah

#s44
it 's fun

#s45
And then there 's a new one that started out that I 've caught occa- a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL I think

#s47
Oh really

#s49
It is a real different one

#s50
It 's uh it 's it 's different

#s51
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it

#s52
But

#s54
No

#s55
I have n't watched that

#s58
Uh-huh

#s62
Oh yeah

#s64
Sounds neat

#s67
Yeah

#s68
Is that on

#s69
what chan- what station

#s71
Oh okay

#s72
What other shows do you like

#s74
Oh yeah

#s75
Well she comes on later

#s76
and I usually have kids around so I do n't end end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it I guess

#s80
Yeah

#s82
That 's right

#s84
Yeah

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
That can happen

#s89
So do you know of any other shows in the even or something that you enjoy

#s91
Oh that 's always fun

#s94
Yeah

#s96
Oh uh-huh

#s98
Oh yeah

#s100
Uh-huh

#s104
Yeah

#s105
well I think

#s106
I also course like to catch the news during the evening hours

#s108
but uh it 's a little tough because that 's when I 'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time

#s109
So usually I do n't get a whole lot of news watching in

#s112
Uh-huh

#s115
Yeah

#s116
yeah

#s117
So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately

#s119
Uh-huh

#s122
Yeah

#s123
well I do n't know if we 've talked our full three minutes or not

#s126
Oh that 's right

#s128
Um yeah

#s130
It is interesting

#s131
So

#s133
No

#s134
no

#s135
just uh doing this as a fund-raiser for our church

#s137
Yeah

#s138
so it kind of makes it easy you know to do a little something for it
