What do you think

#s3
Uh-huh

#s5
I can be

#s6
but go ahead

#s12
Right

#s17
Right

#s18
We fax everything

#s21
We do n't even wait for the mail anymore

#s23
Right

#s29
Right

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Right

#s35
Right

#s37
You 're expected to

#s38
exactly

#s39
And I recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse

#s40
It should be less because we have a microwave

#s41
and our grandmothers had to bake brownies

#s42
and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes

#s43
but the more conveniences we have the more that 's expected of us

#s45
and we have no down time

#s46
Like we do n't stop and wait for things to happen because we do n't have to

#s48
So we keep moving

#s49
We do n't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen

#s50
We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing

#s51
So we have no relaxation time in between

#s53
so they say that 's really a bad thing That you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things

#s55
So that 's good

#s56
That 's an interesting point

#s57
But I just think our our family lives have changed drastically

#s58
And I think that 's ju-

#s59
of course a part of it is technology

#s60
I mean our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their T V shows

#s61
and no-

#s62
some of that is really bad I think

#s63
But we have all single families

#s64
So many single families now

#s65
Uh a lot of working

#s66
both parents are working

#s67
So there 's a whole big effect on our kids

#s68
and not very many of my daughter 's friends really are on their original mother and father

#s69
You know I 'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years

#s73
You 're probably right

#s74
And I 'm an O B nurse

#s75
and that 's never really occurred to me

#s76
but that 's that 's interesting

#s77
I never really thought about it that way

#s83
Yeah

#s84
yeah

#s85
That 's true

#s86
When is this good or not good

#s88
We do n't know that yet

#s90
Yeah

#s91
I do n't know either

#s92
That 's true

#s95
Right

#s96
right

#s99
Yeah

#s100
Yeah

#s101
That 's kind of scary

#s102
Huh Well that 's true

#s103
But I

#s104
it 's just very very different

#s105
and I guess every ten years it 's just been very different

#s107
So And I do n't know what 's going to happen

#s108
Uh I know what I 'm seeing here at m- my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they 're establishing careers

#s111
and they 've got their homes

#s112
and they 've got
