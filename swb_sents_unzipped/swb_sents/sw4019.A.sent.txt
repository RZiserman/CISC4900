Okay um Chuck do you have any pets there at your home

#s4
And what kind do you have

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Well we have a cat

#s11
um he 's probably oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby

#s13
Oh Uh how 's the disposition of your Siamese cat

#s16
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s22
Well yeah

#s23
he 's uh he has been really aggressive uh especially towards my little girl for some reason

#s25
He 's uh been so mean to her

#s27
We 've had him for about two years

#s29
and he was so mean to her um right after we first got him

#s30
So we had him neutered and and declawed

#s31
and now he bites her

#s32
He ca n't scratch her any more

#s34
he bites her

#s36
Yeah

#s37
yeah

#s38
he has a couple of times

#s39
so

#s41
But he 's a very possessive cat

#s42
He he loves my son

#s43
it 's his cat

#s44
and he 's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him

#s46
and he 's so funny

#s47
he just follows my son around just like a dog

#s49
He wo n't even let my son shower

#s51
He meows and wants to get in the bathroom

#s52
and while he showers it 's so hilarious

#s53
So he 's quite a animal

#s58
Yeah

#s60
Yeah

#s61
well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just could n't have him being so aggressive towards the girl

#s64
but uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit

#s65
and we do keep our daughter away from him

#s66
So

#s69
Were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house

#s71
It is

#s72
uh-huh

#s73
We we tried a dog about four years ago

#s74
and we ended up with uh oh malamute and some other kind of mix

#s75
Anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home

#s76
So we gave him up and tried

#s78
Yes

#s79
uh-huh

#s80
we 're in a house

#s81
but we 're in a subdivision where we really ca n't allow the dog

#s83
we could n't allow him to run free

#s84
so he was just chained up all the time

#s85
and it was it was unfortunate

#s87
So have you tried any other pets

#s92
Oh

#s94
Oh

#s96
Uh-huh

#s97
Oh my word

#s100
Oh my word

#s102
And do they they just paper train it or something

#s107
Yeah

#s108
Well rabbits are darling

#s109
That would be fun if you could get them trained

#s110
Otherwise they 're pretty smelly

#s113
Oh

#s115
Huh-uh

#s116
