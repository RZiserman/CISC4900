#s1
Okay

#s3
Probably once every five years

#s5
Uh-huh

#s8
Yeah

#s9
and that is the hardest part about getting the fam- the stuff together

#s10
and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu

#s12
And you

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Yeah

#s21
That makes it a lot easier A lot more convenient

#s22
That is why we only do it once every five or ten years

#s24
Spec-

#s25
because it is always that hard to get everyone together

#s30
Yeah

#s31
see that is kind of what happened with ours

#s32
That is why we have not had one in a long time

#s35
So so to make one successful I mean I mean what do you all do

#s37
Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time

#s39
Uh do you all start planning real far ahead of time

#s44
Oh really

#s47
Yeah

#s50
Eat a lot

#s52
It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out

#s54
and so we have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone can uh start their uh vacation time

#s60
Uh-huh

#s63
Yeah

#s64
Yeah

#s65
is that one of your uh

#s66
I mean uh

#s69
But you also manage to make them

#s71
Yeah

#s74
Yeah

#s76
You ca n't really get away

#s82
Well now that we have been talking about it I uh I am kind of getting home sick now

#s83
Because it has been over three years since I have been home to see my grandparents

#s85
Well my my grandfather is the only one that is still around

#s87
And see my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically

#s89
So unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it is kind of like

#s90
She was like the glue

#s91
so

#s95
Originally uh I uh was born in Missouri

#s97
But uh you know we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana Mississippi uh here in Texas

#s99
but it is harder for everyone to get in get home

#s102
Well but the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters

#s103
So it is easier for us few stragglers to go home

#s106
Yeah

#s112
Well uh how do you all communicate Like to plan it and every thing

#s113
Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it

#s114
or do you all like mail out stuff

#s119
Yeah

#s127
Well uh I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten over ten years

#s128
It was like do n't you remember me

#s129
And I am like no

#s131
Yeah

#s132
I know

#s135
Do you

#s136
I mean is that since

#s137
I mean do you have them every year

#s140
MUMBLEx

#s142
Yeah

#s144
Well I think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we do n't have them that often

#s146
and then when we do and everyone finally does get together

#s147
it is like after the you know
