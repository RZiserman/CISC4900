#s1
do you have a P C

#s4
Uh-huh

#s5
Yeah

#s6
a lot of my friends are into Macintoshes

#s7
I have a um P C a I B M P C myself

#s9
A two eighty-six

#s10
I 'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six

#s11
Um

#s13
Um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal

#s15
Um but I um I think eventually I 'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that

#s16
Um what do you find that you use yours mostly for

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s26
No

#s27
I I think I I 'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although you know I do like the the graphical user environment

#s31
Yeah

#s32
it 's um

#s33
I want I want to be able MUMBLEx I just want it more for multi tasking which I suppose is also like a Macintosh

#s35
Uh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s40
Yeah

#s41
that 's what I learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Well do you use your computer for um just things around the house or in the MUMBLEx

#s49
Well see what do you do

#s51
Oh wow

#s52
Um and uh are these like uh do these programs um

#s53
are are they based on on a on a um other language

#s54
or are they based are they based

#s55
like a lot of the um you know a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world

#s56
and the teacher just tries to tries to teach English you know through natural understanding

#s58
Uh-huh

#s60
Well it was just uh when I was high school I worked for the community school

#s61
and they had a English second language class

#s62
and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time

#s64
I imagine it 's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you do n't have as many cues

#s65
you ca n't do n't have hand gestures and things like that

#s69
Uh-huh

#s71
Uh-huh

#s74
Uh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that

#s77
Uh-huh

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s83
Yeah

#s84
I would imagine so

#s85
Um so um what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E

#s88
Uh-huh

#s89
It it 's MUMBLEx

#s91
Yes

#s92
it 's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much

#s93
I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it

#s95
and you know then then we then I started playing with Apples you know

#s96
and those had forty-eight

#s97
or you know if they were really great they had sixty-four K

#s99
Uh I know I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them is all

#s100
and

#s102
there 's I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K

#s103
and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time

#s105
And you know it 's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you

#s106
I 'm not sure about Macintoshes

#s107
but I know I B M -s you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time

#s109
You know that 's that 's your low- that 's the low end

#s110
Uh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s117
Uh-huh

#s118
Yeah

#s119
I imagine MUMBLEx
