#s33
and I ha- we have a news you know

#s34

#s36
You know I 'm

#s37

#s39
I 'm I 'm really up on uh current affairs

#s40
I get you know the news and and everything

#s46
Um well I 'm not getting an-

#s47
no

#s48
I 'm not getting any news magazines

#s50
but um you know as as I said I do

#s51
it 's uh it 's easy to keep up on current event- you know on cert- you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day

#s59
And uh

#s61
Uh I do n't know

#s62
Is there anything missing

#s63
I you know

#s66
And I do n't know you know

#s67
what what 's I mean what are we supposed to uh compare it to you know I mean the quality uh

#s69
whatever they tell you you know

#s70
I uh I guess I I you know I 'm satisfied

#s71
I mean I uh you know

#s72
they they 're supposedly covering everything that happens

#s73
so

#s76
you know

#s81
Oh really

#s83
Oh

#s86
Well uh sometimes it 's such a you know

#s87
it 's it 's so um slight you know

#s88
like the tremors are so slight that they do n't even bother putting it in the paper

#s91
But most of the ti- the times I find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there you know there 'll be a small article in the paper about it

#s93
But uh

#s97
Oh well That 's what sells papers

#s101
That 's um that 's been like that since they the first newspaper you know

#s105
You know but um I do n't know

#s106
I I guess I 'm satisfied

#s107
I do n't uh

#s109
I mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really

#s112
We do n't get a you know

#s117
Oh yeah

#s118
I was going to

#s119
Sure

#s120
yeah

#s121
Sometimes you do n't even want to be bothered with the news because it 's all so bad

#s123
It 's all so negative you know

#s126
But

#s128
Well we have to keep talking I guess

#s131
Oh

#s134
Oh is it really

#s137
Well yeah

#s138
I do n't I do n't uh

#s141
I do n't know

#s142
we 're sup- I guess we 're supposed to wait

#s144
or I do n't know

#s147
Becau- I you know

#s148
like one

#s149
well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening

#s151
uh and it was really funny

#s152
I I I mixed it made the call

#s153
and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away

#s155
Yeah

#s156
and it was really

#s157
We were laughing I mean

#s158
But you know we do n't really do any gardening

#s159
so like that took like a minute

#s161
and then we just talked about you know whatever I mean

#s165
You know I mean some topics

#s166
really now you know now this topic this is I mean

#s167
there really is n't much to say after you know you uh you know you you tell the person what uh news there uh you know where their where they find their sources of information from

#s170
and then you know if it 's uh if they 're satisfied

#s171
and that 's about it really

#s173
It 's hard to talk for five minutes on this

#s175
So um
