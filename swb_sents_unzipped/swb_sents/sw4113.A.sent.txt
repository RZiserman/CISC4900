Uh so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time

#s4
Uh-huh

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
I agree uh with with both of those things

#s10
but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest

#s12
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s21
Um

#s24
Yeah

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh the only prob- the only problem I see with term limitations uh is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there 's a very lar- you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you d- ca n't just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh Congress person

#s32
Uh I think I think there really is a there 's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there

#s35
Uh-huh

#s39
Yeah

#s40
but

#s45
Uh-huh

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Uh the other the other thing that uh bothers me about our system is just that uh in for for in in in Congress the amount of power any any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they 've been there

#s53
so it 's you know for you know uh

#s54
so unless you have actual you know across the board s- uh limitations the uh you know the idea of

#s55
well we 're going to just we 're

#s56
I 'm I 'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time does n't work

#s57
you know it 's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states are n't doing it at the same time

#s61
Uh-huh

#s66
Uh-huh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s76
Yeah

#s78
Uh-huh

#s82
Well I mean

#s83
t-

#s84
I do n't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because you know officially they do n't do they do n't have any operations within the United States other than administrative

#s87
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
