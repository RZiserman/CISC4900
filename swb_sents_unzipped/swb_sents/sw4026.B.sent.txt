#s2
Um I really have n't had uh too many problems

#s3
Uh seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out

#s6
Yeah

#s7
I 've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three

#s8
and they

#s9
unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time when I bought my new house

#s10
and uh I really do n't have any recourse

#s11
so I had to call and have them all repaired and that

#s13
Yeah

#s14
it was a hassle

#s17
Yeah

#s18
the warranty on the refrigerator uh

#s19
the i-

#s20
the refrigerator warranty 's still good

#s21
but the ice maker itself passed its three years

#s22
and it was three years and two months

#s24
No

#s28
Uh watch out

#s32
Uh-huh

#s36
Um

#s41
I usually have pretty good luck with appliances

#s42
but I just uh

#s43
it was within two days that all three of these stopped working

#s44
and the the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump

#s46
and the uh microwave had to have uh some kind of something I ca n't even pronounce

#s47
and they uh

#s48
the dryer had to have a new heating element

#s49
so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them

#s51
Uh within two days of each other

#s54
I was

#s55
it was n't a good week

#s56
I was pretty mad

#s57
And plus the place that I 'd bought them all had gone out of business

#s58
so even if I I think even if I had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured

#s59
but still they were through that retailer

#s60
so I do n't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not

#s63
But I did n't have to worry about all that because they were n't under warranty

#s64
So It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all

#s66
but I

#s67
the only other things that I 've ever had trouble with uh

#s68
I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers

#s71
Yeah

#s72
I 've had two or three of those go out

#s73
One was under warranty

#s74
and the other two were n't

#s75
but I just

#s76
other than that you know T V -s and things like that I have n't ever had any trouble with

#s77
I do n't think products are getting much better though

#s82
Oh really

#s84
That 's interesting

#s91
Do you do you test each individual one

#s93
or do you just test

#s94
like if you 've got ten you test one

#s95
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay

#s100
Uh-huh

#s106
Well that 's something I 've never had to use

#s107
it 's never I 've never been involved in an automobile accident

#s108
so luckily that 's a product that I have n't had to test

#s110
But I think it 's a great idea

#s111
I 'm I 'm

#s112
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about

#s113
but that

#s116
Oh I 'm sure they want to be thorough before they

#s117
But uh even

#s118
you know I do n't mind spending the extra money on the car if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing

#s120
I 'm not a real big seat belt

#s121
my uh
