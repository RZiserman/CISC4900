Did you hear our topic

#s2
It 's in regards to discussing homes

#s7
Yeah

#s8
I 'm settled in a place

#s9
I 've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy-eight

#s10
and it 's in Richardson Texas which is north Texas or north Dallas

#s13
And we 've lived in two houses in Richardson

#s14
We moved here in seventy-four and uh changed locations in seventy-eight

#s16
How about yourself

#s22
Yeah

#s23
it 's a nice area

#s31
Are you finding it tough trying to find what you want

#s32
or

#s34
Oh boy

#s37
R- right

#s45
No

#s46
we 're settled

#s47
and uh we 're uh

#s49
I 'm probably older than you

#s50
I 'm fifty-two

#s51
but anyway I my youngest is getting married this year graduating college

#s53
so I can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe

#s55
Oh gosh

#s56
so we 're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere Closer closer to our families

#s61
No

#s62
from West Virginia

#s63
but everyone 's uh my wife 's parents are from the New York New Jersey area

#s65
so but everyone seems uh has seem to relocated down that area

#s67
Seems like a nice place to go

#s78
Oh I understand

#s79
You need very minimum four and probably five

#s82
Right

#s84
It 's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house is n't it

#s88
Uh

#s89
Seems like you get in that category you 're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever

#s90
and it 's that 's an awful lot you know

#s102
Matter of looking

#s103
right

#s104
Lot of people will buy in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the or do something

#s105
I had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school

#s106
and she had uh there were seven kids in her family

#s108
And they converted the dining room and did this and that

#s109
but they always seemed to get along fine you know

#s114
Oh sure

#s115
Oh I know

#s116
and it 's there 's nothing harder than that

#s117
I always just sort of a assign my wife that chore

#s118
then I would let her narrow it down to three or four

#s119
then I 'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do

#s124
Yes

#s125
Why certainly

#s126
I understand that

#s128
I 'm in the uh sporting goods business

#s129
I 'm a manufacturer 's rep

#s130
I represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies

#s133

#s135

#s137

#s141
How how was the uh

#s142
