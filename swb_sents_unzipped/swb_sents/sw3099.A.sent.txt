#s1
Okay

#s2
so what were you saying

#s4
No

#s5
no

#s6
not at all

#s7
I work with computers

#s9
Yep

#s10
they what

#s13
one thing I

#s15
I have some friends that have children

#s16
uh not that many actually

#s18
Uh

#s21
I do not really know

#s22
excuse me

#s23
too much about child care in New York

#s25
Excuse me one second

#s26
Huh-uh

#s27
No

#s28
not at all

#s29
in fact my situation is a little bit strange

#s30
I was uh a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile

#s31
And I have just come back and was doing consulting work

#s34
So I am just taking a little bit of time off right now

#s36
Uh and and I might

#s38
Yeah

#s39
well hopefully I can do some consulting work at home

#s40
And if I can do that it will

#s41
Yeah

#s45
I 'll be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care

#s46
But uh I might start to go crazy with it too

#s48
It is a little

#s49
I miss the intellectual stimulation

#s51
But at the same time I really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now

#s52
And

#s55
Oh yes

#s58
Yeah

#s60
Well I think for me MUMBLEx the important concerns I do not think I would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was like one other child with a with a person

#s63
I would not want her to be into a in a large day care situation so young Because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need

#s66
Maybe if I needed to work part time like four hours a day I might do that cause like you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time

#s67
But uh I just think that you know when there 's two year olds running around the whoever is taking care of the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds

#s69
And only when the infant screams are they going to go there

#s71
and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with

#s73
And you know I play with her most of the time she is awake

#s74
and I think that is so important

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Well such as things for learning gives the child stimulation I think is important

#s80
And uh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s96
Yeah

#s98
well she 's she 's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she 's you know

#s100
She 's two months now nine weeks

#s102
And she 's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that

#s104
And she 's just started that like yesterday or the day before

#s107
and so every days are different

#s109
And I think that you know I think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older

#s110
and I will probably be going back to work around January whereas she will be about eight or nine months old

#s113
And so I think you know she will be at a

#s114
I have heard it 's a rough age to put them into a

#s116
Yeah

#s119
But but I think it

#s121
Yeah

#s122
We are just going to have to see how things work out

#s124
Uh but I am trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that So that she is used to other people taking care of her

#s127
My parents

#s128
my husband 's parents are in France

#s129
So it 's a little bit harder

#s130
but during you know

#s131
sh- sh- she 's met them already

#s133
Not that she will remember them

#s134
but she 's met them

#s142
Uh-huh

#s144
Are they all nearby

#s147
Yeah

#s150
Well if I work part time that might be doable

#s154
Yeah

#s155
well

#s157
right now the situation is so tight at many places that it 's even hard to have a choice

#s160
Incredible

#s161
but you know since this is

#s162
people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids

#s164
uh-huh

#s165
And you know I just find that incredible

#s166
And my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very very soon

#s167
and she is intending to stay home with the baby

#s169
And you know maybe do some free lance type work at home

#s170
And so if I go back to work on a part time basis I am hoping I can leave my daughter with her Because her daughter again will be a couple of months my daughter will be about six months older than hers

#s175
it will be a little rough when she is a very very little infant

#s177
uh-huh

#s178
but like when she is a month or so my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families

#s180
And so uh she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day

#s181
and we cou- might even be able to do it on a trade off basis That I watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off Even if she wants an afternoon just to work Uh and not be bothered

#s186
uh-huh

#s187
we might be able to exchange that way

#s189
And so we will just have to see how things work out

#s190
But I think the whole you know ideally I think uh business should have the day care centers there whether it 's the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether

#s192
they hire a couple of people

#s193
and uh you know parents come down to supervise or whatever

#s202
Yeah

#s203
well she 's

#s204
my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet

#s205
and it 's probably my fault because I do not have a real schedule now

#s209
Yeah

#s210
well she 's been staying up late at night

#s211
and you know sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me

#s214
Right
