#s2
Oh okay

#s3
so it 's right up your alley then

#s6
All right

#s10
Yeah

#s11
I do n't think it 's going to happen either

#s12
but I wish it were

#s13
because I 'm a I got my bachelor 's in mechanical engineering

#s15
I 'm at grad school now in acoustics

#s16
and all we do is metric stuff

#s18
Acoustics

#s20
Yeah

#s21
so everything 's metric

#s22
and then you go to read some order book or something

#s23
and it 's all confusing

#s24
so I do n't understand as much

#s25
so I think we should get one adopted permanently

#s30
Yeah

#s31
a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to

#s33
Yeah

#s35
Uh-huh

#s36
Yeah

#s37
I do n't think switching back and forth is that big a deal

#s38
I think people need to understand more like what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something Just get used to using all the terms

#s39
Because someone says a kilogram

#s40
no one knows what that is

#s42
Yeah

#s45
Yeah

#s46
no one seems to be adopting it

#s47
Metric system no one 's very uh no one wants it at all seems like

#s49
Yeah

#s51
Yeah

#s52
I it 's pretty tough when you get everything confused though

#s53
I think two systems is worse than one though

#s54
Because I know we do a lot of problems and things

#s55
and they 're half english and half metric

#s56
and you you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems

#s57
MUMBLEx just get one

#s58
I prefer metric

#s59
but even if it 's english they should just have one

#s61
Yeah

#s62
yeah

#s63
I think so

#s64
Your your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination

#s67
Yeah

#s69
Yeah

#s70
they have some of those in Ohio

#s71
There 's this one sign 's kind of funny

#s72
It says uh metric signs next hundred miles

#s74
Yeah

#s75
that would force everybody to use it Or to quit selling tape measures in inches

#s78
Yeah

#s79
I guess a hundred is sixty-two

#s85
Yeah

#s86
you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety

#s88
Yeah

#s89
in the engineering they all do pretty much

#s92
Oh in the elementary schools

#s93
I do n't know

#s94
I would n't think so

#s95
I remember a ways back we did like conversions

#s97
but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system

#s101
Yeah

#s102
they learn how many centimeters are in an inch

#s103
and that 's about it
