#s4
Uh I think it 's a real good concept

#s5
Uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined

#s7
From what I 've seen on the news there 's a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing

#s9
Yeah

#s10
Uh there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test

#s11
but they did n't know for sure what it was

#s12
but it was a drug

#s13
so they got turned down

#s14
and uh turns out it was a prescription Or people getting somebody else 's blood test

#s16
Same sort of problem that happens sometimes is these some of these uh like AIDS tests and such

#s23
Yeah

#s26
Oh yeah

#s33
Yeah

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Yeah

#s42
Yeah

#s44
Yeah

#s45
I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart

#s47
and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program

#s48
It 's it 's not a random

#s50
through the s-

#s51
it

#s52
as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test

#s53
Uh

#s55
but MUMBLEx I think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs

#s59
and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that uh going through it in a day

#s60
and bottles get mixed up things like that

#s62
It 's MUMBLEx

#s65
Yeah

#s69
Yeah

#s74
Yeah

#s75
Yeah

#s76
Sam 's is part of Wal-Mart

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Oh yeah

#s86
Company 's

#s87
that was a great place to work

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Yeah

#s92
they got to had

#s93
two or three years in with them you can start buying stock

#s94
and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio Uh not portfolio just you know against Wal-Mart stock

#s97
But uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while

#s104
Uh you 're supposed to get five minutes

#s109
Uh do you have any idea uh

#s110
let 's see

#s111
you were you were tested for drugs as you got into T as as you got into T I

#s114
Yeah

#s115
Uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through

#s116
or

#s122
Okay

#s138
Yeah

#s139
Yeah

#s142
Yeah

#s144
They they it was after I was already working there

#s145
and they were n't testing any of those who were already working

#s147
So
