#s5
I think that would probably uh be very possible

#s6
and and we really would n't feel it in our services

#s9
Yes

#s10
I have

#s13
Right

#s15
Right

#s18
Right

#s23
Yeah

#s24
Well I

#s25
one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes

#s26
and the um regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of of our personal income

#s28
and then the uh corporate you know industries just do n't seem to not pay proportionally

#s30
I think that that would would help a lot

#s31
I guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things

#s32
but I do n't know

#s33
It 's just hard to hard to take and you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use

#s35
And uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction

#s36
But

#s42
Yeah

#s44
Yeah

#s46
Not not going to help

#s47
It 's nev- never helped my my personal situation

#s48
I I ca n't say it would help with theirs either

#s53
Amen

#s62
It seems seems to be

#s63
I you know I

#s64
it really does bother me when I think about you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh a national problem that we ca n't seem to find an an answer to it uh

#s65
I do n't know

#s70
Right

#s73
Yeah

#s79
Well that 's that 's quite possible

#s80
I guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit

#s81
or it will just totally get even more out of control

#s82
but I I do n't know

#s86
Yeah

#s87
I I do

#s89
She 's a

#s90
we 're not feeling too well over here so that

#s92
Yeah

#s95
No

#s96
no

#s97
She 's

#s99
I do n't think I could part with her

#s103
Okay

#s107
Okay

#s108
well thanks

#s110
Bye-bye
