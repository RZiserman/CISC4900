Well Michael what do you think about uh funding for AIDS research

#s2
Do you

#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
Yeah

#s12
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Yeah

#s17
Uh-huh

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
Well I guess I 'm not too aware of how much they 're spending right now You know

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Uh-huh

#s28
yeah

#s30
I mean I

#s31
go ahead

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
Yeah

#s38
Yeah

#s39
Yeah

#s40
I mean I I can see that research is needed

#s41
and you know

#s43
Definitely

#s46
I mean it 's becoming a major problem

#s48
But uh I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more You know

#s53
Right

#s54
and I I feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer

#s56
It 's it 's uh abstinence in certain cases

#s59
and

#s62
Yeah

#s64
And knowing you know

#s66
Uh-huh

#s68
Yeah

#s70
Uh-huh

#s73
Yeah

#s75
Uh-huh

#s77
Yeah

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
Yeah

#s82
Yeah

#s84
I think for a lot of people it has

#s86
So

#s88
So

#s90
Uh-huh

#s91
Drug addicts

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Yeah

#s96
Uh-huh

#s98
Yeah

#s100
Yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s107
Uh-huh

#s110
Well yeah

#s111
boy that 's a hard issue

#s113
It really is

#s116
Yeah

#s117
I mean I I definitely think that it 's the drug problem that needs to be addressed

#s118
but as you say uh people I mean in the meantime

#s119
well someone who 's not ready to give up drugs uh You know

#s123
If they 're perp- perpetrating the AIDS problem passing that on to each other then you know

#s126
Yeah

#s127
Yeah

#s128
Uh-huh

#s131
Yeah

#s133
Yeah

#s135
Uh-huh

#s137
Yeah

#s140
Uh-huh

#s142
Yeah

#s145
Yeah

#s146
I have n't either

#s147
I 've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we 're not spending enough

#s150
and Mostly that 's what I 've heard

#s153
so I do n't know

#s155
And yet I know it 's uh it sounds like big money to me

#s157
But it probably takes a lot

#s162
So

#s165
Uh-huh

#s166
Yeah

#s168
Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that

#s170
Uh-huh

#s174
Uh-huh

#s175
Uh-huh
