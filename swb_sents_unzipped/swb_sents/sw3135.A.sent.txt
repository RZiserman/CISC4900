#s3
Oh yes

#s4
I 'm an old experienced hand

#s5
I started back when it was n't stylish to do that at all

#s6
My daughter that 's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby

#s9
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two

#s10
and then I was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist right off of Walnut Hill and Preston

#s13
And it was a wonderful environment

#s14
I I just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place

#s17
So it worked well

#s19
How about you

#s22
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Uh-huh

#s28
It 's not hard to find anything that 's part-time

#s29
So many of the churches have really strong preschool and children 's day out

#s34
but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little

#s35
and this is one of the few churches that did it

#s36
There were a couple downtown Dallas

#s37
but they were so seemed cold and impersonal

#s38
I just could n't hack it

#s40
And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today

#s41
So there was real continuity

#s43
She went back as a teenager

#s44
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there

#s46
So it it was really neat

#s47
But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love

#s48
and she just kept good people and real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts

#s51
and I 'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that That if they had n't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff

#s58
Uh-huh

#s61
Or pay for it after school

#s62
Our Emily 's in the third grade over at Huffman

#s63
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art

#s64
and you know I willingly did it

#s67
but I thought this makes me angry

#s68
This is something that ought to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do

#s71
Yeah

#s72
Well that 's the only way they 're Yeah well that 's the only way they 're going to be able to do it

#s73
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that

#s75
So in some ways I think the the day schools do serve those purposes

#s80
Yeah

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Put the colors away

#s87
Which is too bad

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s95
Until they were two

#s96
Yeah

#s97
Yeah

#s98
both times they were at our house

#s101
And that was hard too

#s102
I I lucked out with really good people both times

#s103
but I know so many people that are never able to find that

#s104
and I 'd practically give my paycheck away to do it

#s105
so

#s110
Yeah

#s111
Well no

#s112
she did n't live with us

#s113
Uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on baby-sitting money

#s116
And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night

#s118
And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead

#s121
So that that was a plus from that respect as well

#s123
And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her

#s126
So

#s128
I just can not fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center

#s135
Uh-huh

#s137
Uh-huh

#s140
Yeah

#s141
Oh that would be hard

#s143
Well they give a lot more leave

#s144
I work at N C N B now

#s145
and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people are are really expanding

#s147
We have more options now then we did when I my kids were born

#s148
with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it 's not full-time for up to six months

#s151
It 's really neat

#s152
I 've I 've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week

#s153
or they 've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint

#s156
We try to work it with their hours

#s157
And that helps because you do n't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again

#s161
And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals

#s162
I 've

#s163
of course it 's too late for me

#s164
so I 've I 've not tried them to see how effective they are

#s166
but I think we 're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast

#s170
And for our age group it 's too late

#s171
too little too late

#s174
But I I do think it 's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work

#s177
Two income families I think are here to stay

#s179
Uh-huh

#s180
Right

#s182
Yeah

#s184
Oh sure

#s186
You retain employees and keep them longer

#s187
That 's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces

#s193
So I I hope it helps

#s194
It seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time

#s196
because that 's hard

#s199
Uh-huh

#s200
Uh-huh

#s203
Uh-huh

#s205
Well in Plano though the problem is you find

#s206
and this is what I found with Emily

#s207
I from the time she started first grade I wanted her out in Plano area

#s209
And I kept finding neighbors and friends

#s210
and they 'd move

#s212
She ended up being in a different home every year

#s215
And I finally decided I did n't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move

#s217
So this year I I tried Kinder-Care

#s218
and then she 's old enough to
