#s3
Uh-huh

#s6
Oh well I 'm at work

#s7
and I just happened to walk back into my office

#s9
I 've been gone for a little while

#s13
Uh-huh

#s16
I do n't I have n't ever made any

#s17

#s28
Yeah

#s29
Exactly

#s33
Well I never gave it any thought myself

#s34
I was hoping you could tell me what you thought

#s38
Uh-huh

#s53
I think maybe it 's it should stay on a voluntary basis

#s56
Yeah

#s57
Yeah

#s58
I I think it would be good for uh everyone to do something like that

#s59
but I I guess I do n't feel like it should be something forced upon you

#s62
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66

I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while

#s83
Would n't it though

#s85
Uh-huh

#s86

#s141
Huh

#s143
The first time I used to get calls from far away too

#s145
Like Maryland and New Jersey

#s147
and but now it just seems like it 's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from

#s150
Uh-huh

#s152
Uh-huh

#s158
Uh-huh

#s185
No

#s186

#s188
Oh shoot

#s192

#s194
she 's just bugs
