Your turn

#s5
But not for petty theft

#s11
Well it should be used as a deterrent do you think

#s13
Or should it be used uh a- to prevent further uh crime

#s14
Huh

#s20
Uh-huh

#s23
Well you know there 's this old uh Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

#s28
Well one of the things I was thinking about is uh you know from society 's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value

#s29
So if you have someone that that destroys that value uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss

#s31
Of course you have to also put value on the criminal

#s33
So if you terminate him that 's a loss of value

#s35
So you know if you weight everyone equally then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him

#s36
if you do n't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person

#s37
In other words you 'd have to you 'd have to murder more than one other person uh in order to justify taking his life

#s40
Another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people Uh which is pretty delicate thing to do

#s41
But one way of doing it is uh by income

#s42
So if this guy does n't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then then he 's obviously not worth very much

#s44
and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is uh integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of who knows eight hundred thousand dollars

#s45
Uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is uh small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him

#s46
Of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it 's more easy it 's easier to uh to uh terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less Which means

#s47
well

#s49
I suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Now that 's all fine and well and and uh good philosophical

#s55
But if you 're involved yourself personally

#s57
uh I know I have a friend whose uh son was murdered uh on the night before his sixteenth birthday

#s58
And let me tell you uh I I knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well

#s59
and uh you 're talking about real trauma I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies

#s61
The father you know

#s62
of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get I think in terms of psychological impact

#s64
Uh and

#s67
Oh yes

#s68
They found him

#s69
and he is on trial for capital murder

#s72
Uh well actually he has I I 'm sorry He was convicted uh

#s73
and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process

#s74
but
