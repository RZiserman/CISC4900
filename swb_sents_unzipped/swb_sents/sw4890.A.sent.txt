Uh with regard to uh to jury trials I you know I I really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use Because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated body of law

#s2
And if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today 's standards

#s4
So I I really do n't think it they can really do much of anything to change it

#s5
What do you think

#s11
Well wo n't

#s12
well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that

#s13
but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently

#s15
and you know the other two guys sat in the car

#s18
and they did n't get beat up You know

#s21
Rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior

#s23
And uh uh just like the burning and looting is self-destruct

#s25
Everybody says well this is the nineties

#s27
and they 're going to rebuild

#s28
and it 'll be even better

#s29
Hey what do you think

#s30
you know some some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area

#s32
With everybody with that mind set They they 're they 're going to that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto you know

#s34
and you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know

#s39
Well e- everybody is saying this is going to be a new era

#s40
and we 're going to reexamine this thing

#s41
Hey the b- the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed

#s42
They 're a bunch of animals you know

#s43
How can you really deal with an environment where you 're going to lose everything

#s44
Forty deaths

#s45
I mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that

#s49
And I 'm just trying to determine you know how you address how you weigh you know Rodney getting getting the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths

#s51
Yeah

#s52
And there 's no other

#s53
I 'm not su- exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths

#s54
And I 'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because I 'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing

#s57
Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner

#s58
I you know

#s59
no tears

#s61
Yeah

#s62
And and so I but I I suspect a number of them

#s64
You know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street

#s66
And and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before rather than stop

#s67
And uh and there there would have been just nothing but carnage after after after if I 'd been at the wheel

#s69
No one would have stopped me

#s74
Right

#s75
I 'm inside the beltway

#s77
You know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus

#s78
and so and I say well wait a minute

#s79
I 'm inside the beltway

#s80
and I do n't think like that

#s82
I 'm a government employee

#s85
I 'm with the F B I

#s88
Yes

#s89
An- and so uh uh and and the reason I 'm doing this whole thing is because Rick who 's another government employee wanted a spe- segments of my speech that that were done a year ago

#s91
and he wanted another collection a year later

#s93
And so this is my seventh call

#s94
A year ago I did eleven calls

#s96
And so that 's that 's why uh uh that 's why I 'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique you know I have a unique situation here in that if I do n't participate
