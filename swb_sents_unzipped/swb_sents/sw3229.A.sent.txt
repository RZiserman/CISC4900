Okay

#s2
while I was waiting for you to connect I I thought of a couple of menus

#s3
so I decided it had to be in it informal or not

#s4
You know if it 's informal I 'd probably choose something I mean just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that 's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it 's so nice out

#s8
Um if it was formal I 'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something

#s9
I 'm not I 'm not into formal dinner parties

#s10
but I 'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread

#s13
Um I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married

#s14
but it 's kind of the bible of cooking for me

#s17
Then I have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful You know budget cookbooks

#s19
but and of course you get a lot from when you 're growing up

#s22
Um I cook a lot the same as as my mom did

#s23
of course I 've added several different recipes

#s25
but what you serve or what would you

#s28
Well that 's good

#s33
Uh-huh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Huh

#s42
Yeah

#s44
that would be wonderful in these times

#s47
Yeah

#s48
either they 're really fast

#s49
or

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54

#s68
THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK

#s69
That sounds fun

#s70
I find a lot of the cookbooks that I do n't know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things I do n't keep on hand all the time

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
and I have young children

#s73
and our budget 's set you know at this time

#s74
but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
I do n't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I have n't heard of

#s79
That 's why sometimes I shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbook

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
but well it was interesting talking to you

#s82
It 's a fun subject

#s83

#s85

#s116

#s117
