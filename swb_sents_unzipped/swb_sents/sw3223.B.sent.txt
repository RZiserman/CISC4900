#s4
It 's on your favorite T V shows and why

#s7
Uh MAJOR DAD

#s9
I I love it

#s10
I think it promotes good family values

#s11
and it 's funny

#s15
That 's ri-

#s16
yeah

#s18
What kind do you like to watch

#s24
WONDER YEARS

#s29
I like both of those real much also

#s30
I I think basically they pr- same thing they promote family values

#s37
I do too

#s38
I I do n't like it

#s39
uh lot of the shows that that I 've liked in the past like uh oh GOLDEN GIRLS and some of them tend to get so risque

#s40
and when you have children uh watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me

#s45
and uh that 's one of the reasons

#s46
I mean if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE

#s50
yeah

#s51
which I just I was I always felt was wonderful

#s53
uh and so many of them nowadays like I said I think are just um

#s55
uh they they go after well

#s56


#
like I said the risque stuff just I guess they think that 's what people want to watch

#s62
Yes

#s64
Yeah

#s66
Uh-huh

#s68
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s73
I I agree

#s74
Uh do you like the sports programming

#s77
Um I I enjoy those also almost as as much to a certain extent

#s78
I 'm

#s79
our whole house is baseball fans

#s81
and uh we enjoy that

#s82
and uh

#s84
oh yeah

#s85
oh yeah

#s87
Uh probably the Pirates

#s88
but only because of Steve Bushel I guess

#s90
otherwise I really do n't care that much

#s91
but uh you know I 'm I 'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him

#s92
and uh I 'd like to see him do well like all the way to the bank I guess

#s97
Pardon

#s99
Live in live in Plano

#s107
Uh-huh

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
Well yeah

#s113
yeah

#s114
it 's uh

#s115
so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do

#s120
Right

#s127
Uh-huh

#s131
Well it 's

#s132
so many of them now um you know it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in

#s133
and and uh you know I 'm you know I 'm I 'm an adult

#s136
and I have adult tastes now

#s137
but I do n't need that

#s140
uh I I like things that uh are are wholesome I guess

#s145
Uh-huh

#s149
Yes

#s150
yes

#s158
