Where is your favorite place to go

#s5
Oh that 's great

#s7
Have you ever been there

#s12
Oh that 's a perfect age for Disneyworld

#s15
Oh that 's great

#s16
Yeah

#s17
so we 've been there a number of times

#s18
and uh we 're going next year

#s19
We have a business trip every fall

#s20
Well we go on a lot of business trips

#s21
I I do n't work

#s24
Well we do

#s25
We g-

#s26
my husband travels a couple times a month

#s27
and in the position he 's in they do n't care if I go along

#s29
So it 's great

#s30
I just kind of join up when it 's something interesting

#s31
and uh Disneyworld is the one for a week next year

#s34
and it will be at this time of the year

#s35
and this year we 're leaving uh uh matter of fact we 're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans

#s37
Have have you ever been there

#s43
Well you know we went there once

#s44
In fact we had been in Dallas

#s45
and we were on our way home

#s46
and we were driving

#s47
and we said let 's go to New Orleans

#s48
So when he said well this year you know I have a week there on a a project

#s49
he 's going to be

#s50
and then I said well I 'll going along

#s51
I hope it 's swimming season

#s52
because it was n't a tremendous thing amount of things to do That I wanted to do there

#s57
It well and that 's probably

#s58
we do like the night life to an extent

#s59
and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned

#s61
And I 'm kind of anxious for that

#s62
but uh yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better

#s63
Did you know that next week there 's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary

#s66
Well and with a daughter nine it is just

#s67
she 's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind

#s70
Uh so well if you 're working then you 're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go

#s75
Oh that 's

#s76
Well I really I think travel

#s77
when I heard my topic today I thought okay that 's my fav- that 's my favorite

#s79
becau-

#s81
And really at our point of life our children are grown

#s82
and uh it has just worked out really well with this uh position he 's in Because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have you

#s84
and it depends where he 's going whether or not I decide to go along

#s86
but I do do like to travel

#s87
and it 's uh

#s88
I do n't mind the pool life at all during the day

#s90
And I like to sight see

#s91
and I love to shop

#s93
So it 's

#s96
That 's right

#s97
but it

#s99
Well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas

#s101
Uh that

#s102
I would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas uh probably once every maybe year and a half

#s104
And presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles

#s106
and so I 've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets

#s107
because we have a lot of flying with Continental

#s109
and they 're recommending that you use those because they do n't know the future of Continental

#s112
And I said now that we have all the miles we better start using them

#s114
Uh

#s116
So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip

#s117
Uh when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really do n't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas

#s124
I think that 's a good trip

#s126
And really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent

#s128
Now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio

#s129
and it takes a while just to even get to the what I would call the more picturesque part of the country

#s130
we will fly to something like

#s131
once we flew to Colorado to Denver

#s132
and then we rented a car for two weeks

#s133
and we went through the northern route and through Utah and as far west as Las Vegas

#s135
and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned

#s137
And it was oh it was just great

#s139
Oh I I think that 's that 's the way to
