#s8
Yes

#s9
I actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks

#s10
However I do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day

#s11
and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day

#s17
Uh well well DOW JONES for example have the cause the uh news wire

#s20
and it 's picked up and actually available uh at my office

#s21
so it 's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure

#s22
and it 's sort of by category

#s23
For example so I can read a certain business or topics

#s28
Well uh it 's similar to that

#s29
but it 's DOW JONES which is uh the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire

#s41
Uh well actually not

#s42
Uh I do uh follow uh uh uh

#s43
I do n't know how to how to describe it

#s44
so I 'll say a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense

#s45
It 's a weekly but uh but not uh not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things

#s47
I 'd like to say that however uh that I 'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires

#s50
Uh I think that it I think that it has to do with uh

#s51
I personally think uh

#s52
I I have a problem with their viewpoint

#s53
and I personally think that uh ther- that there 's a strong bia- there 's a strong bias in the media

#s59
Yeah

#s60
Absolutely

#s61
Uh after all who who writes

#s62
People who are journalist who are trained to write

#s63
and they 're that 's a liberal uh a liberal field at least from academia

#s65
and uh the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I 'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong

#s68
and it

#s70
That 's right

#s71
Well even if it 's not technical If it 's uh some social thing or whatever It does n't matter

#s72
If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I 'm not expert in it

#s73
They 're telling me lies

#s78
Uh I think both

#s79
Uh by deliberate I I mean mistake mistakes of omission or uh or uh biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have

#s84
So uh uh to give you an example uh we will go out of the printing media

#s85
I know of cases where uh we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they 're talking about is the same thing they are showing you Which is sort of like a deliberate bias Which is which is rather disturbing

#s89
I mean he does that

#s95
Yeah

#s96
I do n't have access either Although I did at one time

#s97
and it was

#s98
I did during the Gulf War

#s99
and it was addictive

#s107
Yeah

#s108
well during that small sample I would think that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks MUMBLEx radio television programming

#s110
So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by uh turning on C N N

#s112
and you
