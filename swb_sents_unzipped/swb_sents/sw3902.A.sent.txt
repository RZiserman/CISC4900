#s1
Okay

#s2
Well why do n't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you

#s4
Yes

#s5
I do

#s9
Oh my gosh

#s11
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Right

#s23
Right

#s27
Yeah

#s31
Right

#s32
My mother-in-law finally

#s33
They had to make a family decision

#s34
There 's seven children in my husband 's family

#s35
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town

#s36
and she has Alzheimer 's

#s37
It was getting where she was getting th- dangerous I mean letting strangers in and things like this

#s39
but they were very fortunate

#s40
It 's a small town

#s41
and she happens to room with one of the doctor 's mothers

#s42
and then she 's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time

#s44
but she really does n't

#s45
Nobody thought she would adjust

#s46
but she has adjusted beautifully

#s48
But then I am also facing my father who is very sick

#s49
and my mother and father reside in Colorado

#s50
She 's been taking care of him

#s51
I do n't know how much longer this can last

#s52
and at that point because he requires round the clock

#s53
He ca n't do anything without her

#s54
He does n't know when to take his medicine

#s55
and it 's really sad

#s56
and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for uh

#s57
my brothers are not interested in helping me

#s58
so I would have to move him down here

#s59
That way

#s60
I want to see the nursing home If I have to put him into one

#s61
You know where I can go see it

#s62
I I 'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado

#s63
And

#s66
Yes

#s67
And some of them are limited care too where people can do uh

#s68
like they have apartment styles

#s69
but that would n't work for him

#s70
I think he is beyond that

#s71
Where if you need help you can get it

#s72
but basically people kind of have a small apartment

#s73
and doctors are available if they need them

#s76
And allows

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Yeah

#s79
Well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive

#s80
Of course I guess all nursing homes there is

#s81
but

#s83
Right

#s86
Yeah

#s87
Right

#s89
Yeah

#s90
I uh

#s91
yeah

#s92
and I think a lot of people who do it now

#s93
In Colorado it 's interesting

#s94
I talked to my mother

#s95
They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home

#s96
And my mother could make it on that

#s97
What she probably would do is disburse the money to me

#s98
and then I would send it back to her

#s99
so that 's what would happen

#s103
Yeah

#s104
It 's unfortunate

#s107
Right

#s108
Yeah

#s109
It 's frightening

#s110
And I guess uh I do n't know how old you are

#s111
I 'm forty-six

#s112
You know we 're the generation moving into this

#s113
and I do n't know how our kids are going to take care of us You know

#s116
Yeah

#s120
Yeah

#s123
Right

#s124
I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise

#s125
and he 's still living at home

#s126
and I do n't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are

#s128
And so it 's kind of

#s129
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations

#s130
but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older

#s131
Uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother I uh you know I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay

#s132
But you see these people in their seventies

#s136
yeah

#s137
most are n't

#s138
That 's the problem

#s144
That 's incredible
