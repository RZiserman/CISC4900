I think that it 's time that we concentrate more on what 's going on within our own borders than what 's going on in the Middle East

#s6
I agree

#s9
Absolutely

#s13
I think that 's great

#s14
Um I 'm glad to see that

#s15
but I again I do n't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a uh well uh a whole lot under any circumstances because I I do n't know I 'm I 'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it 's worth more to them than if you give it to them

#s16
and so I 'm I 'm not much in favor of it

#s17
but I 'm glad to see us advising them

#s19
that does n't seem to cost a whole lot of money

#s22
But I 'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda

#s23
even if it does n't work at least he is somebody who who is working on that problem

#s24
And I I have n't seen that in the last eleven years

#s25
so they do n't seem to have a clue

#s34
Oh I agree

#s35
I just I think we got once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the the world bank and as far as aid is concerned

#s37
and I think there 's a limit

#s38
and we passed it a long time ago

#s42
Yeah

#s43
That 's another thing I do n't understand is is is things like selling technology and uh even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt

#s44
to me that just does n't make any sense as as much in debt as we are

#s46
I just I do n't know

#s47
I think it 's definitely time for a change

#s48
but I do n't see anybody

#s49
I do n't understand too why we have to have Democrats and Republicans and it 's either one way or the other

#s50
this it s- seems to be we 're turning into a black and white society

#s52
you either do it this way

#s53
or you do it that way

#s54
and there 's no in between

#s57
and that uh it obviously is n't working

#s62
Oh yeah

#s64
Oh I agree with you

#s65
Well of course you know we have the national embarrassment in our state Jessie Helms

#s66
and uh as soon as as we can get

#s67
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he he just lines up people against him

#s68
so it 's not too it 's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions

#s69
He 's uh usually on the ninety-eight to two side

#s70
he 's the one of the two that votes

#s72
Yeah

#s73
he 's very ineffective I think

#s76
Right

#s78
Oh unfortunately nineteen ninety

#s80
Yeah

#s81
we 're stuck with him for a little while longer

#s82
but uh unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great

#s83
so I hate
