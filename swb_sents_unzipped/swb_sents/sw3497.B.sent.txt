#s2
Uh it 's really cold

#s3
and it 's supposedly for this time of the year it 's unseasonably cold

#s4
and they 've gotten more snow than they 've ever had

#s6
You have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff

#s7
How about you guys

#s10
Oh

#s13
Yeah

#s14
well the weather let 's see

#s15
well the snow here is different from Utah 's

#s16
because I have lived in Utah for like ten years

#s19
And uh

#s20
Provo

#s21
I was going to B Y U

#s24
Yeah

#s25
And uh the snow is like really cold

#s26
I mean it 's like really humid

#s27
so it seems wetter or something like that

#s28
It 's

#s30
Uh-huh

#s32
It 's more humid in Iowa than Utah

#s35
Yeah

#s37
And it seems like when the winds blow it 's really it goes right through you

#s38
It 's really different from Utah 's weather

#s39
I thought Utah was cold

#s40
but I think Iowa is a lot colder

#s45
Yeah

#s46
I do n't think there is any mountains to stop the wind

#s48
I do n't think there is any mountains to stop the wind

#s52
Yeah

#s53
I think that 's true

#s57
Uh-huh

#s61
Yeah

#s62
yeah

#s63
that 's true

#s65
Yeah

#s69
Uh I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven

#s71
Yeah

#s72
my husband got his doctorate at B Y U

#s73
so that 's

#s74
and so he just graduated this past year

#s77
Uh-huh

#s78
Yeah

#s79
we really miss Well we really miss Utah

#s81
We miss the mountains

#s84
Because it 's like really flat here

#s85
Well not flat but hilly

#s86
But no big mountains or anything

#s89
Uh in August

#s91
Yeah

#s92
But uh see see what else can I say about the weather

#s93
Uh well today was warmer

#s94
It was like forty-five

#s96
So what 's the temperature up today over there

#s99
Oh really

#s104
And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill

#s106
But they talk about wind chill here all the time

#s109
They said it could be like six degrees out and like negative forty-one wind chill

#s111
So that 's what we 're not used to

#s116
So oh I

#s118
What 's that

#s120
Oh I 've only I 've only skied in Utah once

#s122
I only skied once my whole life

#s123
But do you do a lot of skiing there

#s126
Uh-huh
