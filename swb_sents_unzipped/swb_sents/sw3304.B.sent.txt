#s41
Considering I I work for it a living

#s42
but I you know I I 've got a couple of articles published

#s44
It 's kind of kind of neat

#s50
They just get around and and talk techy or or else uh uh you know

#s51

#s54
And uh we kind of help out the people who are really not

#s56
Oh I I think I 'm I think I 'm a hacker

#s57
but I 'm not not kind not the uh the you know dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers

#s59

#s60

#s64
Yeah

#s66
Backpacking

#s69
Yeah

#s70
I belong to a a Boy Scout troop

#s71
It beats paying United Way

#s72
I just you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun

#s77
Uh-huh

#s83
Uh well just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest which is kind of out in east Texas

#s86
And we go to uh places out in

#s87
uh uh let 's see

#s88
what 's that what 's that state north of us

#s89
that state

#s91
yeah

#s92
Yeah

#s93
that one

#s94
That one

#s96
Yeah

#s97
yeah

#s98
And

#s101
Uh no

#s102
to another f- a uh old Indian fort that 's out there

#s103
Trying to think of the name of it

#s104
Durn

#s105
Well yeah

#s106
no

#s107
sorry

#s108
no memory

#s111
No

#s112
I missed out this last year

#s113
I was n't able to get the time off

#s114
but maybe next year

#s115
It 's a good possibility

#s117
Oh yeah

#s118
yeah

#s119
When I was a kid uh we 'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras

#s120
That was loads of fun

#s124
Uh no

#s125
not quite because I 'm not a whole family

#s126
I 'm just me

#s130
Oh yeah

#s131
I rent my kids

#s134
It 's better than you know owning on them and making payments on them and you know things like that

#s139
Oh yeah

#s140
yeah

#s141
Uh not recently because you know like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month you know Someplace

#s143
But uh there 's uh some some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that

#s144
So you know they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go

#s146
Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you do n't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you which seems a a just a tad more relaxing

#s152
Uh-huh
