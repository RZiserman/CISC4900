#s2
Um I do n't really think we have anything in the works as of yet

#s4
Uh we 're a pretty small town

#s5
and uh the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart that show you know plastics paper liter bottles et cetera et cetera

#s9
Yeah

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Yeah

#s20
Oh

#s23
Yeah

#s24
Huh

#s27
Yeah

#s30
Yeah

#s32
Oh

#s35
Oh that would be good

#s39
Yeah

#s40
see it 's not anywhere near that

#s41
Uh we you know

#s42
as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans

#s44
But that 's as far as we go

#s45
because I take them to a girl at work

#s46
and she goes and cashes them in because you know

#s47
I just I can do that for her

#s49
and and I do n't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it

#s52
Yeah

#s54
see we do n't have anything here in Belton

#s55
It 's it 's a pretty small little town

#s58
Yeah

#s60
So you know that 's about all the that we 're doing here

#s61
Uh they 're uh getting a little bit more on

#s62
they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you ca n't Because you know not a lot of people do really know what you know what it 's for

#s67
Yeah

#s71
Uh-huh

#s77
Wow that 's excellent

#s79
That 's good

#s82
Yeah

#s83
Oh

#s86
Yeah

#s87
they are

#s89
Exactly

#s91
Yeah

#s92
see ours just goes in the regular trash

#s94
It just you know there 's not a whole lot

#s96
And there are you know some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff

#s98
But usually it 's it it has n't caught on yet

#s99
I 'm hoping it will soon

#s103
Yeah

#s108
Huh I was n't totally aware of that

#s110
So

#s116
Yeah

#s119
Yeah

#s121
Huh Well

#s123
I ca n't either Because we 're we 're at a very you know beginning stages

#s125
so

#s127
We look forward to it to get better MUMBLEx
