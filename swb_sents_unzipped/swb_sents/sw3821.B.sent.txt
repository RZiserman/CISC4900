#s2
Yeah

#s5
Is that right

#s6
I I know pe- I know some other people that have done that

#s10
Um

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
yeah

#s17
I h- I have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing

#s18
They uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed

#s19
and finally they realized that they were they were abusing them and were n't going to get out of the hole

#s20
and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies

#s21
and they 're still paying away to get out of debt

#s24
But no

#s25
I did just the opposite

#s26
I I guess I I sort of followed in my uh parents ' footsteps

#s27
I have quite a few of them

#s28
I use them continually

#s30
but I uh I basically never charge anything I do n't have the money in the bank to pay for

#s31
And uh and I always pay them off totally every month

#s33
Yeah

#s35
Yeah

#s36
and it you know I mean they they 're just a convenience for me

#s37
I do n't have to get cash out of the bank

#s38
and I do n't have to to be writing checks

#s39
and and uh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s47
Yeah

#s51
Uh-huh

#s52
Yeah

#s53
I mean it it 's easy

#s54
I mean you do n't have anything transferring just a little signature

#s55
so what you know

#s59
Uh-huh

#s61
Right

#s64
Surprising

#s65
Yeah

#s67
Well you know but the

#s68
I mean there are sort some inherent limits there

#s69
you 're not going to you 're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that

#s70
right

#s74
Now I

#s76
W-

#s77
the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know uh not so much discipline

#s78
I mean well I mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances

#s79
but but I hate their their rates so badly I mean their interest rates so badly that I

#s86
I 'm uh thirty-three

#s88
Thirty-two

#s89
excuse me

#s92
Yeah

#s95
Uh-huh

#s99
You know I just that just irritates me so much that that I refuse to pay them interest

#s100
and and my wife recently uh decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off

#s101
and she 's from there and and uh did n't really have the money

#s103
but you know she could pay it off

#s104
and so I sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards

#s105
but she 's paying it

#s106
and uh I just wo n't do it

#s107
I mean she 's paying I do n't know I do n't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest

#s109
and I just you know I just refuse to give it to them

#s110
If I need to borrow that kind of money I 'll go to the bank

#s111
and uh

#s114
You know

#s118
Income

#s119
Oh yeah

#s120
Right

#s121
Right

#s122
Yeah

#s128
Uh-huh

#s129
Right

#s130
High

#s131
I might

#s133
Um

#s134
Right

#s135
Um I might try that because I I have one card that I 've had for about uh I do n't know nine or ten years

#s140
Uh-huh

#s143
Right

#s147
Yeah

#s148
for me the big thing you know is the uh uh is the annual fee

#s149
and I just refuse

#s150
I wo n't get any card now

#s151
I 've I 've got a good rating

#s152
and I 've got you know

#s154
And I 'm not going I 'm not going to pay an annual fee

#s155
The only one I actually pay on is this one that I that the very first
