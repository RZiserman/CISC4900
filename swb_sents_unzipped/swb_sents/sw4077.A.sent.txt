How do you feel about gun control

#s3
Um

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
Uh-huh

#s11
Well do n't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver 's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry

#s12
I mean It varies from State to State

#s17
There is no national

#s19
Uh in most States as long as you are n't a convicted felon You know or on probation or you know other obvious things like that

#s21
Uh and I know I know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before You know be be obviously insane

#s22
and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun

#s26
Uh yeah

#s27
I 'd probably I 'd probably say about a five

#s29
Seems like it 's a good safe number to pick you know

#s31
Uh-huh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s36
Well you know uh uh no-

#s37
if you are looking at like you know country that uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much

#s40
Well I mean yeah

#s41
The uh the

#s42
in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States

#s44
Uh you know I mean the problem though you know they if the since the United States had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already

#s46
You know so it 's it 's really kind of a complex problem

#s48
Uh I 'm not really sure how bad it is

#s49
I 've I 've not really had that many problems with it

#s50
but I mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up

#s53
Uh I mean I think you know in the

#s54
I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years

#s56
Uh-huh

#s58
No

#s59
I 've thought about getting one

#s60
If I get one I think I will probably you know get something

#s61
I probably would n't get a hand gun

#s62
I would probably get like a shotgun

#s63
Just for protecting myself You know from burglar type thing

#s65
I do kind of live in the downtown area

#s67
You know and shotguns are really good because they 're

#s68
I mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know

#s70
Uh and you know you

#s71
yeah

#s72
I just do n't understand these people you know like when they they decide they 're going to buy a gun to protect themselves

#s73
They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know

#s74
they are probably going to miss the person

#s75
and and they 're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know

#s76
I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon

#s77
You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever

#s80
You pretty much stop them

#s81
And you do n't

#s82
then the actual shot does n't go that far you know

#s83
a wall will stop it pretty much

#s85
Uh-huh

#s87
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Yeah

#s94
that that really does scare me People you know that have guns

#s95
because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot

#s96
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person

#s97
that that person rushes you

#s100
And you know you 're pretty much dead you know Because you you 've just told the person that you you 're about to kill them then You know

#s103
and and well I mean you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you are a real danger to them

#s104
and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you

#s108
Uh-huh

#s109
Uh-huh

#s111
Um

#s113
Yeah

#s114
the did it happen at a cafeteria or something

#s118
Uh-huh
