#s2
Yes

#s4
Right

#s6
Really

#s7
what what do you do now

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
Uh-huh

#s11
Uh-huh

#s15
Oh really

#s17
Okay

#s20
Yes

#s21
I do

#s24
Yeah

#s25
and I 'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins

#s27
Have you had yours now

#s29
Yeah

#s31
Oh that 's why I asked you

#s32
I guess it you know it does go in cycles

#s34
and not everyone got theirs right away

#s37
And I I was so relieved because I 've been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it

#s42
And uh

#s43
my garage was just getting overwhelmed

#s45
And of course I did n't go weekly

#s46
so it became quite a big thing

#s48
and uh

#s53
Yes

#s54
yeah

#s56
Uh-huh

#s58
Yeah

#s59
well I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they 're not a recycling number one or two

#s61
Uh ha

#s62
so it was wasting a lot of time

#s63
Yeah

#s65
Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned

#s68
But uh you know but it it 's not that hard now that I 've got this system under control

#s71
Yeah

#s74
Uh uh-huh

#s76
Yeah

#s77
I do find that I do n't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are are being tossed in with the recycling

#s82
And uh I do n't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh

#s83
what are some of the things they do n't recycle

#s84
Oh one thing I thought about the other day were batteries

#s85
just everyday regular batteries Supposedly you know leak and and contaminate the landfills

#s88
and yet what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out

#s91
And they do n't take

#s93
Yeah

#s94
that 's what happens

#s95
because

#s98
Yeah

#s102
Yeah

#s103
yeah

#s104
but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something

#s107
Uh if they 've got these bins for all the other little items

#s108
I 'm sure if p- people will have batteries uh you know quite often to to toss out

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
Oh

#s115
Oh is that right

#s118
Huh

#s120
Registering our garbage

#s122
Yeah

#s125
Would n't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year

#s127
Yeah

#s129
Well except I know it would just not be cost effective

#s130
They 've already got all this money out on hiring uh getting the trucks and hiring people to work them

#s131
I 'm sure they could n't afford that

#s133
But

#s135
uh

#s138
Yeah

#s139
Oh yeah

#s142
Oh it did

#s144
Gosh

#s149
Oh my goodness

#s151
It is sad

#s153
You know

#s154
they paid for those things anyway

#s156
Or our taxes do

#s158
Uh-huh
