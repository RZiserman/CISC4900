#s1
Well I suppose we both have credit cards

#s5
Yeah

#s8
Well I do use them

#s10
Uh I have a few favorites that I use more than others

#s11
and uh I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable

#s12
I I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to

#s14
Uh but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few

#s16
and uh they all can build up

#s18
Uh I think they 're handy

#s19
I just get uh

#s20
I do n't carry a lot of cash with me

#s22
and uh I hate writing checks when you go shopping

#s25
Well do you use credit cards

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Grandmother

#s33
huh

#s50
Well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what your savings is bringing

#s51
Yeah

#s52
It 's really I guess ridiculous to let them keep building

#s57
But I know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand

#s65
Uh- yeah

#s67
so

#s68
Well that 's good

#s69
I 'm looking right now I 'm k- kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate

#s70
It seems that some of them have gotten higher

#s72
and uh I saw on T V they had a program on uh credit cards

#s73
and they 're supposed to

#s74
I do n't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country

#s75
And I did n't write it down at the time

#s77
and then I went and looked and to see what my visa was

#s78
and I think it 's eighteen percent or something

#s80
so think I want to find something that has a lower rate

#s83
No

#s84
I have n't

#s88
Is that the one from Sears

#s94
Okay

#s98
Uh-huh

#s100
Oh they give you money back for using your credit card

#s103
Oh

#s104
That 's it

#s105
I did n't know that

#s108
Um Well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards

#s110
I worked w- at Sears for over ten years

#s111
and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
so you know now they 'll take the Discover

#s115
but I still do n't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard

#s117
But uh I never did apply for a Discover card

#s118
Yeah

#s119
I just figure with the Visa and American Express I probably have an

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
I can do enough damage with those two

#s124
Uh-huh

#s127
I 've got some that I you know I have n't even used at all uh past few years

#s128
I probably would n't be able to use them

#s130
But uh I I do like my Dillard 's

#s131
I have to admit that 's one of my favorite places to shop

#s133
And I do use Dillard 's probably as more than any of the other department stores

#s135
But

#s138
Well

#s139
No

#s140
not too much more about credit cards

#s144
Okay

#s147
Good talking to you Beth

#s149
Good luck

#s151
You too

#s153
Bye
