I 'm Jay in Dallas

#s10
That keeps you plenty of exercise MUMBLEx

#s17
Well I uh I have

#s18
I walked and run ev- um almost every morning

#s19
I 've sort of stopped here with the weather change

#s20
but uh it 's about a thirty minute exercise every morning

#s24
Oh that would

#s25
that 's fantastic exercise

#s33
Um

#s36
All right

#s38
I 'd rather get a bicycle

#s39
but I have an ex- I had an exercise bike in the house but did n't seem to use it enough

#s40
so somebody sold it in a garage sale

#s41
and so uh but I 'd like to get a bike and just do uh do biking outside

#s47
Yeah

#s48
It keeps going

#s49
because I 'm fifty-five

#s50
and it uh it just gets worse

#s51
You still want to eat

#s52
and uh but you just

#s54
I think you feel better too if you get on some program like that

#s55
but uh

#s61
Uh-huh

#s63
Right

#s65
Oh

#s66
I know it it it some of it is so tough

#s68
and uh especially when somebody 's uh planning lunch for you and they know what what 's good for you

#s69
I think when we do it ourselves

#s70
we take the easy way sometimes

#s73
So

#s75
So anyway

#s77
