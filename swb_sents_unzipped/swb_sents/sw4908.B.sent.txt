Sounds

#s6
But I gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans

#s9
Uh-huh

#s15
Yes

#s17
Yes

#s18
I know

#s19
Not only have I come to Washington but uh I find it very amusing that uh the thing that was just instituted here is very similar

#s20
That is we also have blue bins

#s21
We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck

#s22
and uh landfill space is in deed the driving factor here

#s23
And in fact uh despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still uh very hard to come by

#s25
A-

#s28
Ah

#s29
but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will

#s31
Well uh

#s33
Yes

#s34
other than nuking it

#s35
Um in fact Los Alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general

#s36
Um it it involves for instance uh creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general And uh and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements

#s39
And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has uh made some special uh polymers that have the ability to uh make certain actinide elements adhere to them

#s40
Uh uh they 've uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste

#s42
and again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh E S and H uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about I think much more than they should

#s43
Actually I 've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable

#s45
Back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the uh paper from the computer center

#s46
and uh in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable pa- recycled paper

#s53
I think that 's a wonderful idea

#s54
The only alternative I would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody 's garbage would be a real pain Uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill

#s56
and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more

#s59
Uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
