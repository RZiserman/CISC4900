#s9
Uh-huh

#s18
And a lot of hassle all year round

#s19
and cans laying

#s21
Yeah

#s31
No

#s32
I read in the paper this week where maybe

#s33
I do n't know if it w- was

#s34
I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time

#s36
But it it should be starting I would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that

#s37
I 'm not sure all what we 're going to have to do whether we have three separate containers

#s38
I really do n't understand that part on what they 've told you to separate everything

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Oh

#s53
Uh-huh

#s56
Well it would get messy too

#s59
I I I know other places when they recycle

#s60
they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot And uh which we 're not in the habit of doing

#s63
I was brought up uh you know long time ago that they did n't even have cans

#s64
They had bottles

#s65
and you 'd return them to the the grocery store

#s67
and you 'd get our money back

#s68
and that that was all well and good

#s69
They do n't seem to still be doing that

#s70
If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass

#s71
but I guess this day and age they do n't

#s76
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s82
Yeah

#s83
and they uh p-

#s84
I I think kids do n't appreciate maybe the value of money that it 's so little that they do n't care

#s85
they can get more somewhere else

#s88
Uh for a good

#s89
right

#s90
They 're

#s91
the nickels the dimes or what I suppose it might be quarters fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just do n't seem to to care that that much about a small amount of money

#s94
But we we did buy a can crusher

#s95
and we are crushing cans

#s96
and when we buy the soda when it 's on sale for ninety-nine cents

#s97
so I would say in the last three years we 've probably used a lot more cans than ever before

#s99
Uh it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat

#s102
So that 's the main reason we 're we sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles

#s104
Well as you say it takes a while to build it up

#s105
Since we 've had the crusher all summer we I guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we have n't ta-

#s106
oh I think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a a recycling place probably at one of the li-
