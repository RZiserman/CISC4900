#s1
Well uh and that 's an idea that 's been around for kicked around for a long time

#s2
I do n't know that it 's ever been seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that

#s3
But uh I believe Israel does that do n't they for their

#s7
Wel-

#s8
everybody has to do has to do something

#s11
Or maybe maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone

#s12
But uh

#s15
Okay

#s17
No

#s18
I do n't think it 's it 's necessa- n-

#s19
I think of that

#s20
It it could n't be

#s21
Military service is not that much

#s22
but m- military used to do it

#s23
but the idea that uh there are things that that do need to be done that could be done

#s24
and then uh country would benefit from one year from from everybody and even out the the uh requirement

#s27
Well now that 's a thought

#s28
Yeah

#s30
Yeah

#s33
Uh-huh

#s36
Yeah

#s37
right

#s39
Oh yeah

#s40
I 'm afraid you 're right there

#s41
But uh but uh anything like this that came up whether it

#s42
it quickly would be significant industry in in figuring out how to get around it where people

#s45
Yeah

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s48
Yeah

#s54
Yeah

#s55
Uh I suspect that the- yeah that that that that 's not the thing That they that they do n't feel it 's open to them

#s56
it 's just that they uh are more self-centered if you will and not not considering a voluntary MUMBLEx

#s59
Yeah

#s61
Uh-huh

#s62
Uh-huh

#s65
Yeah

#s66
yeah

#s67
And uh now I didn- I do n't know it di-

#s68
I I think you 're right that that 's not the not the way that the society these days is going

#s69
and I I think we need to we need to try to figure out some way to to turn that around that everybody

#s72
Huh

#s75
Yeah

#s78
Yeah

#s80
Well that could be

#s82
Yeah

#s83
right

#s85
Yeah

#s86
I I agree with that

#s87
and uh and I I I do n't know what what has what has set it off or what

#s88
but i- it it certainly seems to me that that uh uh things in in the last twenty-three years uh things hav- have definitely gone towards uh very much the concentration on self and and loss of loss of perspective in terms
