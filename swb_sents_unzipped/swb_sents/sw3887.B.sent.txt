#s1
Well I guess we 're uh forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution

#s2
I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars

#s3
and low polluting fuels are being experimented with Ethanol and other types of fuels

#s6
I you know I assume that the major sources are cars and factories

#s8
But I I do n't know for sure

#s9
I just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from would

#s10
comes over the border from us

#s19
Yeah

#s23
Yeah

#s24
the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes

#s26
Um I guess there 's been a lot of pressure to um do away with the C F C 's in these spray bottles which has been a real problem

#s30
Again I that 's what I hear

#s31
and and there 's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there 's a hole in the ozone or not

#s32
but at last I heard it was uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially

#s36
Well it is scary

#s37
and I think it will uh continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively

#s39
We 've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment

#s41
I I I 'm wondering whether it 's going to get to the point where you ca n't do that

#s43
In Los Angeles they 're apparently going to

#s44
they 've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh barbecues gasoline lawn mowers um

#s46
and it 's really bad in places like Los Angeles

#s47
and it 's gotten bad in Denver

#s49
and and uh it 's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky

#s50
And people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars

#s52
and our economy seems to

#s53
and this I think is one of the big problems

#s56
Yeah

#s65
Yeah

#s67
Well that makes a lot of sense

#s68
I mean I I had n't thought about it that way

#s69
but it it

#s71
Yeah

#s76
No

#s77
and I think

#s79
Yeah

#s80
and I think that that more and more it 's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that 's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it 's going to tell us about it

#s82
and uh we 're going to feel it

#s83
and I think it 's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars

#s86
and in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable

#s87
For example taxing people heavily for using their cars

#s89
And uh I have a little sports car that I enjoy using

#s90
and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive

#s91
but I think uh we 're going to have to make some fundamental changes

#s92
and and I 'm I 'm not sure how long it 's going to take or what it 's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and houses we sell
