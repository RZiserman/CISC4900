Okay

#s2
Uh generally I get uh you know most of my news uh in the you know weekly magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK and and uh U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT With with occasional smatterings of of uh you know THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and of course the local paper

#s4
But uh my my only complaint is I really do n't enough time to to look at the articles every day and and go through a paper you know exhaust the details

#s5
So that 's why I concentrate on weekly magazines

#s7
Well yes

#s8
I I well I I do n't think I have the time to really become a student in every article

#s10
And and so I I I like the weekly magazines uh because i- it gives me you know the high points of what 's going on

#s12
Uh but many times uh you know the the local uh the local news kind of suffers you know

#s13
But here I am you know cheek by jowl with our nation 's capital

#s14
and

#s18
Yeah

#s19
Yes

#s20
E- exactly

#s21
Well when when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I 'm saying to myself hey guys I 'm inside the beltway

#s22
But uh i- it turns out that uh that that the C N N is I think is great

#s23
And for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events

#s25
but generally they 're they 're they 're more sound bitish you know kind of thing

#s26
and and I do n't really uh you know I do n't really feel as though I 've a gotten sufficient uh you know dose of news that way

#s30
Uh-huh

#s31
Yes

#s40
Well the MERCURY and the and the and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really can stand up there

#s44
Uh Redwood City

#s45

#s50

#s64

#s65
But but really the th- on the public T V you know MACNEIL LEHRER is one is an hour 's program that I always

#s68
if if I watch any news program it will be MACNEIL LEHRER And and occasionally C SPAN

#s70
I I like a I saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of Marion Berry 's drug bust

#s71

#s72
and and and a- also they have the uh the uh uh PARLIAMENT 'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD

#s75
It

#s79
when wh- when it first uh you know when it first tuned in on that I you know

#s80
it 's one that 's

#s81
I think it was somebody was just scarcely just just ripping the hell out of someo- another person

#s82
And I

#s83
and everybody was you know making noise in the background

#s84
And then

#s85
