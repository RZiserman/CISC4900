#s1
Um I do n't

#s2
I am only twenty-eight

#s3
and I have n't had much experience with nursing homes

#s4
I do n't I have never visited any them

#s5
and uh I do n't think I 've ever even been in one

#s6
Have you

#s11
Uh-huh

#s16
And it it takes a lot of care

#s17
like twenty-four hours a day someone has to be

#s18
Well there 's someone in my my fiancee 's family

#s21
His grandmother too

#s22
and they 're that hi-

#s23
her son his uncle whatever you know anyway

#s24
He he has he 's recently retired

#s25
and so he 's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke

#s26
and and all the other children are working or whatever

#s28
They 're all my parents age

#s29
And uh so he 's got you know

#s30
his retirement though is really twenty-four hours a day

#s31
They have a day care two days a week

#s32
They call it senior citizen day care

#s33
But she goes in the senior citizen center

#s35
So sh- he gets a break two days a week

#s36
but it 's only for like two or three hours at a time

#s38
And you know just you see a lot of things like you you know MUMBLEx was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired

#s39
and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he 's not able to do now

#s41
But he refuses to consider any other

#s42
I do n't

#s44
Yeah

#s45
and is that how your parents feel

#s46
or

#s48
Uh-huh

#s56
Uh-huh

#s62
I know at this

#s63
I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents either you know

#s64
But I I really feel bad for the people I see th-

#s65
not very

#s66
I 'm not really really experienced

#s67
but like I said I just have that one family

#s68
and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be

#s69
But

#s71
Yeah

#s72
and he 's got you know seven brothers and sisters

#s73
and and uh he 's the one because he 's the one that is n't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone

#s74
And

#s77
Oh well that 's great

#s79
That 's a good idea

#s80
We ought to

#s81
Yeah

#s82
and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever I do n't know what they 're going to do

#s83
It 's really not my family

#s84
It 's my fiancee 's

#s85
so I do n't I ca n't say much

#s87
But I always feel like I would never put my parents in either

#s88
and I wonder I 'm going to be the only sibling that is n't going to have children

#s89
so if my parents do need to live with someone it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for You know

#s91
and I 'm I

#s92
that 's fine with me

#s93
my fiancee and I both figure that 's what 's we 're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever

#s94
If the-

#s95
You know what I mean

#s96
We feel like it 's our responsibility

#s98
and I feel like I would never put them in a home

#s99
But I wonder how much you know if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something

#s101
You think about it

#s102
and it 's really

#s103
I do n't know

#s104
This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country

#s107
And It 's really more of a um like a respect issue th- that the older older people in other countries that I 've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people

#s108
and and they really seem as wise

#s109
and and in this country nobody really Yeah nobody really pays attention

#s111
and they oh the old-timer made with the old way

#s112
and nobody respects the traditions

#s113
And you know it 's

#s114
I I 'm not saying that I do either

#s115
but you know it 's just funny

#s117
and and we really do n't have any that do n't have the Social Security and everything

#s118
really is n't that much for elderly people to live on

#s120
You know even if they 're in good health it 's incredible

#s122
They do n't have any

#s123
they do n't get special treatment

#s124
and maybe they should you know because we 're all going to get old someday

#s127
And so it 's a it 's kind of a depressing topic though

#s128
How old are you

#s130
So it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother

#s133
