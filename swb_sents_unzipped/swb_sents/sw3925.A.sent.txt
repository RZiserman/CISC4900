#s1
Okay

#s2
I think the first thing they said

#s3
I have written this down

#s4
so it would

#s5
is it p- do you think it 's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government

#s8
Yeah

#s11
Right

#s12
That 's a good point

#s14
That 's an int- you know that 's interesting

#s15
I had read something one time

#s16
and it was just applying to governments in general

#s17
it was written many years ago

#s18
It said that it 's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers

#s19
And I thought that was interesting

#s20
It was n't just talking about our government

#s21
It was just government in general From times past you know on

#s23
and

#s25
Right

#s26
And that would be a next question to ask

#s27
How many do you think are in there for pub- for bu-

#s28
because they want to be a service to us

#s29
or are they in there for their own gains

#s30
and personally I feel it 's probably there 's probably some of each

#s35
Uh-huh

#s36
Yeah

#s39
Yeah

#s41
Oh yeah

#s42
And they talked uh

#s43
the other

#s44
let 's see

#s45
Third question was how m- MUMBLEx serving for their own gains do you think goes on

#s46
then they

#s47
that 's hard to answ-

#s48
I 'm sure there 's a lot But I agree with you there 's a lot in business

#s49
I think that 's just I think that 's very normal that we should not ex- I think

#s51
I think we put too much on politicians

#s52
We expect them to only be there to serve us you know

#s53
Yeah

#s55
That 's a problem is n't it

#s57
It 's interesting

#s58
because I 'm taking a Texas government class right now

#s59
and one of the things MUMBLEx

#s60
it 's so easy to blame them to MUMBLEx

#s61
a lot of times I think it 's our own fault

#s62
They lie to us because we do n't want to hear the truth

#s65
And it

#s66
If they tell us the truth we do n't elect them and Especially with all this fron- co- stuff coming up here lately about people 's past

#s68
and I do n't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore

#s70
Because it 's I think it 's gotten just care- well

#s71
we 're not talking about issues

#s72
we 're talking about somebody 's personal life

#s73
and and we 're getting away from what we ought to be looking at

#s76
Right

#s77
You know I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out

#s78
I do n't think there would be too many left

#s80
Uh-huh

#s83
Uh at uh it 's T C J C

#s84
Tex- Tarrant County Junior College

#s86
Yeah

#s88
And it 's really it 's really enjoyable

#s89
I like it

#s90
And then they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption

#s91
and I do n't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally

#s93
Yeah

#s94
but that does n't mean

#s96
I do n't think making laws will stop it

#s97
I mean I do n't know how many laws you would have to have

#s98
I mean

#s101
No

#s102
sure did n't did it

#s103
So no

#s104
I think you can legislate

#s105
but I think there 's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating

#s106
and we would end up with so many more laws that you know

#s107
I mean I just think that 's human nature that you 're going to have corruption in government in business personal life I mean you know

#s110
Right

#s112
Yeah

#s114
Yeah

#s115
I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes

#s116
but when I think about where I 'd want to go you know this is still the best

#s117
or I can

#s122
Yeah

#s123
Yeah

#s124
at its worst I think we 've got the best
