I think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't uh convict someone who uh really should n't be convicted

#s3
Um and I think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that

#s4
I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you would n't convict someone who maybe should be convicted

#s6
Have you ever served on a jury before

#s8
Oh okay

#s10
Uh what sorts of cases were they

#s12
So were they criminal or civil

#s15
Oh okay

#s16
What uh what was the verdict

#s17
Did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision

#s19
Yeah

#s23
So did it become

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Uh

#s29
Uh But since it was a civil case it really did n't matter right

#s30
You just needed a majority

#s32
What was what was the other case

#s33
That was also civil

#s37
Yeah

#s39
Oh did n't really even count

#s41
Yeah

#s42
I 'm I 'm a college student

#s43
so I have n't been you know a jury eligible age for very long

#s45
um and uh I did get one summons actually at one point

#s46
but I declined it which I 'm able to do because I 'm a student because it was uh a very bad time

#s49
Yeah I mean I I really I would like to uh to do at some point um

#s50
but I I have n't

#s51
Uh one one thing that I I think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh I I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now

#s52
but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well

#s53
Especially sort of

#s55
How wha-

#s57
Uh you thought it turned out pretty well

#s62
Yeah

#s65
Oh so it was just kind of a zoo

#s66
and the jurors just sort of

#s67
someone had to figure out what was going on

#s69
Um That 's interesting

#s70
Did it did it work out pretty well in the end

#s71
I mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial

#s72
or

#s76
So it work- it did end up working out pretty well

#s79
The one thing I sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there 's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes

#s81
you know it 's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy

#s82
and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract

#s83
it 's sort of a matter of um you know sometimes getting into very technical issues

#s84
and I wonder if uh if there 's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion

#s86
In in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind

#s87
So

#s90
Yeah

#s91
Uh

#s93
Oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it

#s94
and he had n't made the payments

#s97
Yeah

#s100
Uh so they were suing to get it back

#s103
Uh

#s105
Yeah

#s107
Uh
