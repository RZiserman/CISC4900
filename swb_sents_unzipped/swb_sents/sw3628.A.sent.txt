What vacations have you been on that you like

#s4
Right

#s7
Uh-huh

#s10
So you

#s11
most of yours is kind of driving

#s12
and

#s16
Um how how far do you usually end end up driving just

#s19
Now where you 're from where

#s20
Oh Wisconsin

#s23
Okay

#s24
Yeah

#s25
I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin

#s27
So yeah

#s28
that 's quite a ways

#s31
I 've uh

#s32
we went to California this last year and uh liked it

#s34
but it was too crowded

#s36
Walt Disney World and other places it 's just the wrong time of the year to go

#s38
And uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything 's uh outrageously priced

#s40
and uh kind of

#s41
you wonder if they 're it 's really worth it to pay uh thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in

#s43
But There 's lots of fun places to see Um

#s45
I think the scenery kind of

#s46
that 's something do to

#s47
you like to get up in mountains

#s48
or

#s51
Do you have any mountains nearby

#s53
Pretty flat is n't it

#s56
Um I think uh the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money is n't it

#s59
What vacation have you enjoyed the most

#s65
What is it

#s68
Okay

#s69
Uh-huh

#s75
Probably a city in itself kind of like huh

#s78
Summer place

#s79
How far away is it

#s81
Huh

#s83
Okay

#s84
sure

#s87
Sure

#s93
Right

#s94
well and you can probably

#s95
you 're in a climate that 's kind of humid

#s96
so you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things

#s97
Our our climate 's real dry

#s99
and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery

#s100
Most of most most of the land 's pretty brown

#s101
You do n't have as much of the greenery like you have

#s104
Uh Idaho is where I live

#s105
and uh

#s107
Yes

#s109
It 's by uh

#s110
I have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that I 'm on the phone

#s111
It 's by um Boise

#s112
You ever heard of Boise

#s115
And uh it 's fine

#s116
it 's nice

#s117
It 's uh lot different kind of

#s118
I lived in Indiana for a while

#s119
and it 's a real different uh land and scenery than there

#s120
It 's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that

#s122
I think uh there 's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern Utah the canyons canyon lands and Bryce Canyon

#s123
and oh boy they 're gorgeous

#s125
MUMBLEx

#s127
Those are kind of fun places

#s128
We usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer which is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah

#s129
and the lake goes on forever

#s130
and that 's real pretty over there too

#s132
But I think I 'm kind of a summer vacationer

#s137
Right

#s138
Right

#s141
Where 'd you
