#s1
Okay

#s6
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
do you use a computer

#s16
Oh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Yeah

#s20
mine is really simple because I got all our bills paid off when uh he was a Marine

#s21
he went to Saudi Arabia

#s22
and while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off

#s23
so really the only bills I have is rent utilities insurance you know

#s25
so they come in

#s26
I pay them

#s27
and that 's it you know

#s28
that 's about the extent of it you know

#s31
I do n't really have this major budget or anything

#s32
I just really I 'm real thrifty

#s33
I take care of you know two children and me and uh

#s34
just real careful with the money you know What little we have

#s36
so that 's what I do

#s41
No

#s43
Uh-uh

#s44
You know I mean I I I 've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know

#s46
you buy something on credit

#s48
and you pay twice as much for it when you get done You know

#s50
so

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
I do n't have too many I do n't have too many weaknesses

#s55
but I found out a credit card was one of them You know

#s57
it 's so much easy easier you know if something 's on sale if you 're a woman and you 're a sale person

#s58
it 's like oh it 's on sale

#s59
let 's go grab it you know

#s60
so uh and if you do n't have the money then use a credit card

#s61
so I got rid of them credit cards You know

#s64
Yeah

#s65
that was my weakness

#s66
It was n't bad

#s67
I mean I did n't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that

#s68
just I just learned that that was n't for me you know

#s71
So but I self-employed you know

#s72
I have my own little cleaning business type thing

#s73
so uh I keep

#s76
No

#s77
it 's not hard

#s78
I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I 've made and uh you know what it 's going to have to go for that month

#s79
and you know it 's not that not that hard Not at all

#s82
So I always do my own income tax you know

#s84
Do you

#s86
Huh

#s88
R-

#s89
all you got to do is read a book I mean read the little book they send

#s90
you fill in the blanks and go

#s95
I mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to

#s98
it 's dumb

#s99
I guess if you had some really complicated stuff

#s100
but I do n't

#s101
so I do n't mess with it

#s103
But I do n't use a calculator either you know

#s105
I do n't I do n't have that mu- that many you know things to add up

#s106
so

#s109
Oh yeah

#s111
And we have a

#s112
I bank at N C N B here

#s113
and they have a number that you can call in

#s114
and I always call in and like once every other week or so

#s115
and I will uh check off what checks have cleared

#s116
and

#s118
Do you do that

#s120
You do too

#s122
And I always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because I always want to know exactly what I have you know

#s124
I do that real often

#s125
I do that

#s126
so anyway
