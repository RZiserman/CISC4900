#s3
Right

#s4
I think I 've seen some statistics that say that uh it 's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life

#s7
Right

#s9
Well that 's

#s10
committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment

#s11
or they think they 're not going to get caught

#s12
or

#s18
Yeah

#s19
b-

#s20
Yeah

#s21
but you also have to think whether it 's worthwhile on the individual basis

#s22
for example someone like uh Jeffrey Dahlmer

#s23
do you want

#s24
by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again

#s27
Whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility

#s30
Yeah

#s31
I do n't think he could ever redeem himself

#s32
but in some cases yes

#s37
Yeah

#s38
it 's it 's

#s39
yeah

#s40
once you 've made a decision that way it 's a little difficult to go back on it

#s45
Oh yeah

#s46
yeah

#s47
it 's a-

#s48
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused

#s55
Right

#s58
Yeah

#s59
and there there they seem that the profit marg- uh drug dealers the profit margin 's so high that yeah the the risk is almost not there

#s64
Yeah

#s67
Yeah

#s69
Yeah

#s70
well it 's also

#s72
I used to live in Georgia

#s73
and you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment

#s74
but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it 's very racially related and ethnically related

#s79
Right

#s85
Right

#s86
Right

#s87
and that

#s88
and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we do n't currently do this of making restitution

#s91
You you will work your prison job

#s92
and any money you earn will go to the victim 's family

#s96
Uh-huh

#s99
Right

#s102
Uh-huh

#s104
Yeah

#s105
well I I think on some of it you have to say someone 's responsible for his actions

#s106
I never like the uh the defense Well I never liked the uh insanity defense
