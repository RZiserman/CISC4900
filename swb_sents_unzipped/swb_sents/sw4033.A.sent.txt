So how do you get most of your current event information

#s4
Uh-huh

#s7
Right

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
I would imagine going to college though your professors and different things

#s12
you keep up on what 's going on

#s15
Yeah

#s18
Right

#s19
Well I 'm a housewife

#s20
I have three kids

#s21
and so um I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um talking with people and just hearing what 's going on MUMBLEx

#s26
Just the regular channel

#s27
just channel eight

#s29
That 's our channel here

#s30
that 's the um eyewitness news

#s32
So

#s35
Oh uh-huh

#s36
Yeah

#s40
Right

#s41
And I think even in the elections they choose who they 're going to follow and who they 're not

#s42
and basically you know if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will you know kind of publicize his name

#s46
I do n't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it

#s47
I think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on

#s52
Right

#s53
Right

#s54
And the news too it just does n't um cover that many stories

#s55
I mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff

#s57
but other than that you really do n't know what 's going on

#s59
Um I will read our current letters that come out on elections

#s60
and I guess I do read that

#s61
and I do study who 's running in our area

#s62
and I do study what 's going on in the economy

#s63
It you know

#s64
and I guess I do read other magazines um too to get my information

#s68
Right

#s71
I used to read every month a READER 'S DIGEST

#s73
but um now I guess I just have friends that clip articles

#s74
or if I you know am interested in something

#s75
of course during the w- when we were in war I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on

#s77
But a lot of the times I you know I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper

#s78
but I just ca n't seem to find the time

#s80
If they put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things

#s82
But

#s84
Right

#s86
Well I um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of

#s87
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news

#s88
You know we just do n't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas

#s90
that we want to hear what 's going on with the economy what 's being done to help it what 's going on in other countries what 's you know just more information

#s92
Yeah

#s94
Well I guess we 'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics

#s101
I know

#s102
we 're trying to get tickets to it right now

#s104
Yeah

#s107
Yeah

#s112
Right

#s113
right

#s115
Yeah

#s116
they spent a lot of time that 's another thing they spend a long time on sports

#s117
and I think that um that 's fine

#s118
I would like to see more time spent on other things

#s120
But
