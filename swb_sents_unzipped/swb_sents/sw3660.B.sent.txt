#s1
Okay

#s2
all set then

#s3
Uh what do you think about it

#s6
Uh-huh

#s8
Oh I did n't realize that

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Okay

#s18
Uh-huh

#s19
yeah

#s20
that 's right

#s21
I have heard

#s22
uh I do n't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh a positive indication of drugs but there 's not really there were n't really any there

#s24
Uh every now and then there 's an error

#s25
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated

#s27
Yeah

#s28
I I work here at Texas Instruments

#s29
so uh we we do a let me think do we

#s30
yeah

#s31
everyone coming in

#s32
I guess I did three years ago

#s34
Everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure

#s35
and they talk about it as a you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions

#s37
So if they uh they test for drugs

#s39
I I 'm I ca n't even remember if we do random sampling anymore

#s40
I know we did in the military

#s41
but I do n't know if once you 're in they continue to do it

#s43
but I guess you 're always on call for it

#s46
Uh-huh

#s49
Uh-huh

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
B-

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
right

#s61
So your big beef with it is the uh

#s63
Is is it 's a good idea

#s64
but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better

#s66
Make sure it 's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever

#s67
Yeah

#s68
I I I tend to agree with you David

#s70
Yeah

#s71
my brother uh brother used to work for Wal-Mart

#s72
and then I do n't know if he still does or what because I do n't know if Sam 's is actually part of it

#s73
but he you know is working at Sam 's now

#s77
Okay

#s78
yeah

#s79
then he 's been working for the company for a while too

#s80
He uh

#s82
Good company uh

#s84
You all uh have some

#s85
he 's telling me about good profit sharing and all that

#s88
so

#s90
It 's good news

#s95
Uh-huh

#s96
Uh-huh

#s98
Yeah

#s99
that 's what my brother was telling me

#s100
That 's good good new- good deal

#s101
Well uh how long were we s-

#s102
I have n't done this in a couple months

#s103
How long were we supposed to discuss for

#s105
Okay

#s106
we got a couple more minutes then I guess

#s107
Uh think what else I can say about that

#s108
Uh

#s112
Right

#s113
uh everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test

#s117
Uh no

#s118
well let me think about that

#s119
Yeah

#s120
it was after I w- I had already been hired

#s121
Uh

#s123
Yeah

#s124
you get hired

#s125
then you come in the first

#s126
I

#s127
seems to me I remember that uh I was hired came in and went through some orientation

#s128
and I thought I

#s129
boy I ca n't remember

#s130
That would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test

#s131
Maybe it was during the interview

#s132
I came up a couple times for an interview

#s133
so it 's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened

#s134
But uh I guess just like other companies other friends I 've been hearing about that have been moving around

#s135
it 's it 's before

#s136
They have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment

#s137
so I 'm sure that happened to me too

#s140
What what about oh

#s141
they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart

#s143
so

#s146
Right
