I was going to say my uh college is Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota

#s2
and our head football coach Dennis Muir used to be an assistant coach at B Y U

#s4
So I thought that was kind of an in- interesting coincidence

#s7
Uh Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota

#s9
I ju-

#s10
in what major or what year

#s13
International business

#s15
Yeah

#s16
And you

#s19
Okay

#s21
Well that sounds interesting

#s22
How long of a program is that

#s28
You know I read a study once

#s29
and it said that uh like thirty-four percent of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program

#s32
It took me it took me five years

#s34
So you just you get started

#s35
and you change your mind

#s36
or you want to pick up a second major

#s37
if you 're management you you thought I I 'll take that marketing

#s38
it 's just only was three more classes you know

#s40
and you just does n't happen that you get out in four years

#s42
But

#s44
My advice is is uh look for at the student to faculty ratio you know

#s45
if you 're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one I do n't think you 're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one

#s48
Yeah

#s50
it was about twenty-six to one

#s52
Yeah

#s54
Which is you know

#s55
it it 's interesting

#s56
but it it 's

#s57
what I thought was nice is you could al- there was always time to talk to professor you know

#s58
and and they knew you

#s60
You were n't just in their class you know

#s61
and so you could you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time

#s62
and or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you know you could sit down talk to them about a problem

#s63
They 're always willing to help you out

#s64
So but I I 's I I put that against uh my high school where we had uh a biology class of three hundred and fifty students

#s65
and

#s67
Yeah

#s69
it was a biology lecture class

#s71
and you know it it just was n't the same

#s72
You 're sitting there

#s73
and you 're taking notes

#s74
and you know you got a computerized test scores multiple choice because there 's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test uh you know a three hundred fifty person short answer test

#s76
And it just was n't the same

#s77
You you 'd run you 'd pass the teacher in high school

#s78
and even in high school you could say high to your teachers unless you 're in that biology class

#s79
and they just they 'd look at you like do I know you

#s80
or should I know you

#s87
Do you get uh a lot of tutoring

#s88
or

#s93
Uh-huh

#s99
And you could get there

#s100
and his office hours could I mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him

#s101
and you still did n't get to talk to him anyway

#s104
Well what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college

#s109
That 's excellent advice

#s118
Well it it it does get it

#s119
You know you get to the point where it 's I 'm never going to get done

#s121
You know I I mean I was taking summer classes

#s122
and MUMBLEx let me get out of here

#s124
But uh no

#s125
that 's good advice

#s126
Even if you do n't have your major decided on have an idea what you think you might want you know

#s127
so you do n't want management

#s128
but you think you want business
