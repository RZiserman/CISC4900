Okay

#s3
So uh with the issue of trial by jury uh I actually found the whole question about whether you need a a unan- a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting

#s8
I do n't know if it 's even true that it 's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where uh I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve

#s12
Yeah

#s18
Well I 'd be curious as to what the uh requirement for a an acquittal is

#s19
And I I do n't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal

#s20
But I do n't know whether you need an a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit

#s26
Yeah

#s27
I 'd agree with that

#s28
But I 've never had the the opportunity to serve on a jury although I 've been out here and registered for I guess about five years

#s31
But

#s36
Oh

#s42
Well the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that you know after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is a you know something like a nine three or or more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they 're right

#s44
and in fact I 'm not sure that that 's any more uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than than anything else

#s46
Uh-huh

#s49
Yeah

#s50
I 'd read one book I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things that uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at what had at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations

#s53
Some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing the verdict uh you know everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict

#s58
Uh-huh

#s60
Yeah

#s61
