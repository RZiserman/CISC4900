#s1
You have any pets

#s3
Yeah

#s7
Two dogs

#s8
what kind

#s11
Schnauzers

#s12
Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer

#s14
Uh I 'm going into all this because I used to w- I just got done working at a pet shop actually

#s17
Yeah

#s20
Uh

#s26
Yeah

#s28
Oh yeah

#s30
That 's good

#s31
They say

#s35
Did n't expect that would happen

#s36
Yeah

#s37
that 's cool

#s38
that 's nice

#s39
Uh let 's see

#s40
what was the other dog you had

#s42
Oh a sheltie

#s46
Yeah

#s48
They can be nippy

#s50
Yeah

#s51
shelties are nice

#s52
Everybody seems to be really happy with them

#s53
They 're good temperament

#s55
They put up with a lot

#s59
Schnauzers in particular probably

#s62
Oh yeah

#s66
Yeah

#s67
I g-

#s68
it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are

#s71
Yeah

#s72
the- they 're bred down so much

#s73
It 's

#s75
They are n't the best pets

#s77
Yeah

#s79
Yeah

#s80
I mean some people seem fairly well suited for for uh miniature poodles and such

#s83
Pit bull

#s84
They might

#s85
they 're actually very friendly dogs

#s88
Uh they 're really nice

#s89
I I 've dealt with quite a few of them

#s90
People uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like they uh fit collars and stuff on them

#s91
and they are they are just really nice really friendly uh kind of like medium intelligence Uh

#s95
Well because some people uh want to train them as

#s97
Yeah

#s99
You really ca n't get a pit bull from birth that 's that way

#s101
Yeah

#s102
it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond

#s105
Right

#s107
Yeah

#s108
they are n't they are n't by nature really nasty critters

#s109
They are very determined critters

#s111
and so once you get them going it 's not good to to deal with

#s112
but they I I really like them

#s113
I was I was impressed by them

#s114
They 're they 're real sturdy little critters

#s115
and they are n't that big

#s116
And uh just really friendly

#s119
I was I was overwhelmed

#s122
Yeah

#s124
Yeah

#s125
right now

#s127
They picked up a lot of bad press lately

#s130
Well yeah

#s132
But any any any pet 's going to can can be bad if you train it to be that way

#s135
Well yeah

#s136
it 's when

#s137
in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a k- a child in a house

#s141
I mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret

#s142
The the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild

#s144
and you know they should expect something like that to happen

#s145
And so bas-

#s146
now it 's like ferrets are outlawed in the town

#s148
Yeah

#s149
it it bit him

#s151
And that was that was not a good thing

#s152
but I think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was f- it was a fairly wild ferret

#s154
Had n't they had n't

#s155
Yeah

#s156
I mean they really should have should have expected it And taken the precautions

#s158
They did n't

#s160
It 's too bad it happened though

#s163
Right
