#s13
Well that sounds good

#s18
I 've heard the name

#s19
and that 's about all it goes

#s24
Yeah

#s25
That 's one problem with the the nursing home environment

#s26
It the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse

#s28
Uh you know they do n't always have their full wits about them

#s30
They 're not completely up on what should be going on or what 's not going on

#s32
And it can be pretty sad

#s33
I 've got a had a grandmother who had a stroke

#s34
And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died

#s36
And you know it 's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida

#s37
My in- families was up in Maryland

#s39
and the other part of her family was up in uh New York state

#s41
And you know it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was uh you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke

#s43
And you know the nursing home was the you know best facility to put her in You know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work

#s45
and both my uh aunts and uncle work Which means it 's you know very difficult for some-

#s47
you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time

#s49
And you know there 's also a lot of medical problems that ca n't always be completely handled in the home Which makes it you know

#s51
it 's a necessary evil I think

#s55
Yeah

#s56
Yeah

#s57
And you know even there you have to watch out for you know

#s58
you get one person who 's a little bit dishonest working in there

#s59
and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes

#s69
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s74
Uh-huh

#s77
Either that or they 're just so understaffed that they ca n't afford to put in the uh care that they need Cause it 's you know

#s80
an elderly person can you know

#s81
it 's like a newborn baby

#s82
You need to have twenty-four hour care uh answering all the needs cause they ca n't do much for themselves at certain points

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
And you know there 's a lot of number of

#s89
the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be And remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can

#s93
And it very very hard for them to accept that

#s94
We just uh moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility

#s96
More of a retirement home

#s97
He 's got his own efficiency apartment

#s99
And they provide one meal a day

#s101
And you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him

#s103
But they do have you know group activities going on

#s105
Uh he 'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida

#s107
Uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland

#s108
and it 's it 's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else

#s112
Well there was stuff like that in Florida

#s113
but
