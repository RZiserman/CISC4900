#s1
Yes

#s5
Yes

#s7
Yes

#s8
I am

#s12
Well I 'm I 'm happy we got through

#s15
Well I 'm I 'm especially interested with what what 's happening in the Soviet Union uh

#s16
the the move to uh the the the Ukraine 's vote to uh basically to secede and set itself up independently uh is quite a remarkable counts

#s19
is that is that reported in the Texas papers

#s26
Uh as an area it 's not

#s29
I I 'm afraid I do n't have the statistics in front of me

#s31
It 's a it 's not a tiny area

#s32
Uh if I was looking at a U S map I would say it was sort of reminds me of of a uh

#s33
it 's not as big as California proportionately

#s36
But but but it 's it 's more significant in the sense of it 's a great agricultural region

#s40
Yeah

#s43
They 're completely out now

#s46
Yes

#s47
the three the three Baltic uh republics got out as quickly as they could

#s49
Right

#s50
it 's it 's very important for the economics of the whole of the Soviet Union

#s52
Right uh

#s53
except they ca n't fight

#s56
It 's done democratically uh

#s58
Yes

#s60
Yes

#s65
Uh

#s68
That that 's true uh

#s69
has n't happened here for a while

#s70
but it uh

#s73
Uh-huh

#s77
No

#s78
I 've I 've heard they 're I hear you have some problems

#s82
Do do you do you blame the the government in Washington for this

#s86
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s89
Uh-huh

#s94
So then you think it 's it 's you think it 's Reagan and Bush have done this

#s95
or is it just coincidence it was during this period

#s99
Uh-huh

#s101
Oh the Chinese use slave labor too

#s103
That 's that 's one of the ways they get away with it

#s105
Yeah

#s109
Uh I do n't think there 's any one simple answer to the whole thing

#s111
I mean it 's that 's very complicated

#s115
So which one are we going to throw out

#s118
Uh-huh

#s120
Texas Texas used to be a democratic state did n't it

#s127
