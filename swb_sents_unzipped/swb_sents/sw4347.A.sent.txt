#s3
Uh not too bad really

#s4
Uh I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just I really did n't want it

#s5
but I got it anyway

#s6
and uh it was a Braun

#s7
and they were real good about taking it back

#s8
It was n't a problem at all

#s9
so uh I was able to get that back pretty easily

#s11
But uh I do n't know

#s12
I really have n't returned a whole lot lately

#s13
Have you

#s21
Um

#s23
Right

#s27
Yeah

#s29
Right

#s30
like

#s32
Exactly

#s34
I was reading

#s35
Right

#s36
I was reading something in uh CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact

#s37
They were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out And about how yeah you 'd like to buy an American car maybe

#s39
but uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever

#s41
Uh like I 've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger

#s42
and and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi

#s44
You know so it 's like what are you going to do you know

#s47
But uh that 's the way it is

#s48
I do n't know

#s49
I I personally feel that uh uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them you know that 's the way it goes

#s50
and you know people man- more than manufacturers should get a clue

#s51
and you know they should start making quality products

#s56
That 's what I thought too until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue

#s58
Uh they 've got all the American well all the all the cars rated you know

#s59
and uh essentially I h- I do n't see much of a trend

#s60
I mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there

#s61
There 's nothing wrong with them

#s62
Uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars

#s63
But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy

#s64
and they 're pieces of junk

#s68
Yeah

#s69
that 's ninety that 's eighty-six through ninety-one

#s71
But uh I do n't know

#s72
may- maybe they 're getting better

#s73
maybe they 're starting to get a clue

#s74
Uh

#s77
Yeah

#s78
that 's just it

#s79
Technology that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road

#s80
But uh

#s82
Oh yeah

#s83
Yeah

#s84
because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time

#s87
Uh

#s89
Yeah

#s93
Yeah

#s94
It

#s95
uh th- they keep up c- with it pretty quickly

#s96
and that 's that 's a real good thing I guess

#s98
Uh I do n't know

#s101
Yeah

#s102
Right

#s103
they 're kind of the leaders right now you know

#s104
I used to see all those commercials for Windows you know

#s105
and you 're like oh gee they 're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name

#s108
Yeah you know

#s110
Exactly

#s111
almost is the key word there too you know because I I really I 've used both

#s112
and I really do n't see an advantage of Windows at all

#s114
Uh

#s115
Yeah

#s116
yeah

#s117
that 's true too

#s118
But uh I do n't know

#s119
I 'm really I 've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because I do n't have one at home

#s120
I I do use a Mac at work

#s121
but uh uh I really do n't do n't do much with it at home

#s123
but uh

#s129
Right

#s130
Uh-huh

#s131
Yeah

#s132
you sound like you must uh work in the computer business

#s139
Yeah

#s140
All right

#s143
No

#s145
Well that 's that 's all right

#s147
Yeah

#s148
that 's true

#s149
Something that I find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something

#s150
say you want to buy a personal computer

#s151
and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know

#s152
let let 's take the example the modem for you know

#s154
Okay

#s155
w- w- what baud rate do you get

#s156
Well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-
