Well what do you feel about the um present situation in the Mideast

#s3
Uh-huh

#s5
Yeah

#s6
I agree

#s7
I think I think there 's definitely been some changes um

#s8
and I think you know the the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on on the situation

#s10
Um you know in that there 's there 's not you kno- there you know i- you know

#s11
basically since the end of World War two there was always you know that little proxy war going on You know with um the U S funding Israel and and the um Soviet Union funding the Arab countries

#s14
Yeah

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Yeah

#s17
but on the same token you know Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the U S in being you know the foothold of capitalism You know in in the Mideast

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s25
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s29
Yeah

#s30
but on the other hand you know if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the you know they they would n't have been given access to the friend or foe codes

#s32
They basically would have you know had a had a f- they had they would have had had to fly through you know two enemies

#s34
The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them

#s36
I mean of course you know public statements can be taken for

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
D-

#s45
Uh-huh

#s46
You know well to begin with you know

#s47
I pretty much question or what what the U S -s motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement

#s49
Uh I

#s50
the cynical side of me says that you know it was more for uh the the domestic political situation than for anything else You know and that you know and for portraying Bush is a strong President

#s54
Uh I mean I really I really think that that my gut feeling is that that you know he pretty much picked picked the fight with uh with um Hussein

#s56
I mean I 'm not not saying at all that Hussein was n't quite willing to ge- enter that fight

#s58
But you know I think I think that that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt

#s60
Where a lot

#s62
I think I mean I thought I think that um in the past we 've allowed lots of things like that to happen

#s64
And I I really do n't I really do n't think that

#s65
I think I think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests

#s67
Um

#s72
Yeah

#s73
And I mean in in in along this line since since you know it it really it really did n't accomplish very much except we 're getting getting uh the Iraqis out of Kuwait

#s75
I just do n't I just do n't I I I d- I I I do n't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle

#s77
Um you know over over the uh over over what what probably wo n't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically

#s80
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s88
Well I have I have very fixed feelings about Israel

#s89
Um I think that that for a long while we 've we 've had almost a you know ha- t-
