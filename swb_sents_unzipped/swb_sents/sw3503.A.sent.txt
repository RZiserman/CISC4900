#s1
Well how do you feel about capital punishment

#s3
Oh you did

#s6
Wow

#s9
Oh really

#s16
Yeah

#s21
Right

#s23
Uh-huh

#s27
Right

#s35
Oh wow

#s40
Okay

#s42
Wow

#s45
Really

#s48
Wow

#s49
Yeah

#s50
well the cases like that they should

#s52
I mean if he 's going to be drastic somebody has to be drastic back

#s56
Really

#s61
Right

#s62
Wow

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
No no remorse whatsoever huh

#s68
Well I guess in cases like that you know where the guy would obviously go out and do it again I mean you 've got to do something

#s73
Right

#s74
Wow

#s78
You 're kidding

#s83
Right

#s86
Really

#s87
Well I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun

#s89
Oh really

#s91
Okay

#s93
Oh

#s95
Wow

#s96
What

#s98
I guess cases like that I do n't see why they would n't bring in the new evidence from the other case

#s100
Okay

#s101
Of that crime

#s103
but he was found guilty of anoth-

#s104
okay

#s108
That works

#s109
Right

#s111
Well they pushing the death penalty

#s114
Wow

#s121
Okay

#s122
So

#s125
Yeah

#s126
and I 'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much

#s130
That 's true

#s131
I mean if you 're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole

#s137
That 's true

#s140
Uh-huh

#s142
That 's true

#s143
I mean I do n't know whether I 'd stay in prison or not

#s144
or

#s147
Yes ma'am

#s149
Yes

#s150
they do

#s151
I

#s152
they 've had a a number of cases here

#s154
I mean not a whole lot

#s155
well Jackson I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year

#s157
It was like last like year they had forty-nine

#s158
so that 's going up

#s160
But yeah

#s161
they have a death penalty

#s162
I hear of one every now and then

#s164
And I visited the prison up here and at Parchman

#s166
and I 've been

#s167
I have n't

#s168
they wo n't let you on death row

#s169
but they 'll let you look down the hall

#s171
You ca n't see any prisoners

#s172
and and it 's kind of a weird feeling

#s173
I 've been

#s174
they took us around on a tour you know

#s175
and I went got to walk in the gas chamber

#s177
and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you 're sitting there saying like people have died here

#s179
But I guess just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff the people up there
