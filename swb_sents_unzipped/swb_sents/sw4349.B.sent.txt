Just to pack the bearings

#s32
Right

#s39
Right

#s40
And they repacked the wheel bearings

#s57
You know they 've gotten to the point that where they do n't weigh very much

#s58
and the the surface materials on the pads is so good

#s66
Right

#s67
Well it sounds like you 've had some good experiences with that

#s70
uh and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that

#s73
Uh I I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car

#s74
and uh and in fact I have an eighty-seven Mustang with a three O two in it that I 've uh beefed up a little bit

#s78
and one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine does n't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels

#s80
uh the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were uh not even cast aluminum

#s81
They were just pressed aluminum

#s83
Well there 's three there 's three pulleys that you change

#s84
You change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and uh the water pump pulley

#s88
So when I changed those over I put on these these pressed aluminum things

#s90
and uh probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out

#s92
So in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way But not far enough to notice

#s96
So I was on my way to work one day

#s97
and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half

#s98
So there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump

#s99
and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank

#s101
and uh I
