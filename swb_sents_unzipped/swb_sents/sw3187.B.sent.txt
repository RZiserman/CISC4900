#s2
Well I do n't feel very good about it

#s3
but I think that at some times it can be the right thing to do

#s4
We sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore

#s6
He actually died a few months after that

#s7
and so as

#s8
at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do

#s9
because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days

#s12
Um well the see uh well

#s13
we he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list

#s15
right

#s16
we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into

#s17
Or but naturally

#s18
no

#s19
it was even Mennonite related

#s20
I 'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home

#s21
Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in

#s25
Uh what do you think

#s29
Uh-huh

#s31
Yeah

#s35
Yeah

#s37
yeah

#s38
that 's important I would say

#s42
Okay

#s48
Yeah

#s50
Right

#s51
so that

#s53
Right

#s54
and that becomes difficult then

#s60
Uh-huh

#s61
Yep

#s62
we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life

#s63
but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could

#s67
but he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain

#s69
and this

#s70
eventually things just went too far

#s72
and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home

#s77
Right

#s79
well that 's yeah that 's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what 's the right thing

#s81
And

#s85
Uh-huh

#s89
Yep
