Well I kind of uh I watch the uh national news every day for one

#s3
I also read one or two papers a day

#s4
and I 'm a I 'm pretty much a news junkie

#s5
and I tune in to C N N a lot

#s8
Uh every evening at six thirty I believe I watch the national news

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
as opposed to paying for cable

#s20
Yeah

#s22
Uh overall I I

#s23
the quality of the news you get o- off of most uh sources I would say is pretty low

#s24
It 's

#s25
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage

#s26
and that 's one of the reasons where I why I try and get as many sources as possible

#s27
because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on You would hope

#s28
but still you know hard to say that what you 've heard is what really is

#s31
Well I read uh the local newspaper

#s32
and I also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Right

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
Right

#s47
Pretty low

#s50
Right

#s51
I I really like N P R a lot

#s56
Right

#s57
yeah

#s58
I miss N P R a lot also

#s59
I really like them because they give uh

#s60
instead of being as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which I think is good

#s62
And they also

#s63
their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing

#s67
Uh-huh

#s71
Right

#s72
yeah

#s74
Sure was

#s78
Uh-huh

#s80
Yeah

#s81
that was

#s82
but then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was r- really good

#s89
Uh-uh

#s92
Right

#s94
Well but the but the ne- news news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that 's good also about C Span which I I tune into every once in a while

#s97
Yeah

#s98
it it is really kind of boring

#s99
but you know that 's

#s100
if if you do n't watch it there then you 're going to hear somebody else 's canned uh report somebody else 's view about it

#s101
and that 's what you 're supposed you 're supposed to

#s102
if you watch the news you 're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own pinion opinion which I have n't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else 's
