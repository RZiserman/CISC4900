Hi

#s3
Uh uh I I should say something

#s5
That I 'm the uh least informed

#s6
this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic

#s7
But it 's I 'm the least informed person in the whole United States

#s8
This has not been determined yet

#s9
but I I I 've never read a newspaper in my entire life

#s10
and I 've I I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I 'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off

#s11
But

#s13
Well no

#s14
I I 've I 've explored that with lots of people

#s15
Uh they 've tried to lock me up and uh things like that

#s16
But uh uh I 'm basically not interested

#s17
and I also find the uh everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and mis- and off the uh uh

#s18
what am I trying to say Uh

#s19
I do learn about things Largely from friends

#s22
and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS

#s23
You know someone will write a book about something

#s24
and then I 'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier

#s26
But it

#s27
and somehow

#s28
and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always so uh covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I do n't have much confidence in it

#s29
But I mean I do n't think it 's just that I 'm lazy

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
Right

#s40
Yeah

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Yeah

#s46
Right

#s47
Does n't want

#s48
Let me ask by the way just for the record

#s49
I I 'm I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them

#s50
So I mean I 'm not being elitist in that sense I hope Uh

#s52
Yeah

#s53
What

#s56
Yeah

#s57
By the way when you say most people think it is I think it 's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is percent

#s59
Oh you do n't

#s61
Right

#s63
Yeah

#s68
Uh-huh

#s71
Yeah

#s72
Uh I did on the uh the Supreme Court hearings ar- the for uh uh the whole business of uh

#s73
see I actually have a a

#s75
Yeah

#s76
the Thomas and Anita Hill business

#s78
I I mean that 's that 's the closest thing

#s79
I deeply cared about that

#s81
Uh and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine

#s82
and when I arrived at her house she was engrossed in that

#s83
We ended up watching it for a couple of hours Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea- watching it some more

#s84
And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on

#s85
But even then I did n't end up doing it on my own Uh uh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s91
Right

#s92
right

#s93
Yeah

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
Yeah

#s96
Do you ever read
