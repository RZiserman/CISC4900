#s1
What do you think about it

#s5
Yeah

#s10
Yeah

#s11
I I especially agree that if it 's an area where they could cause somebody else you know harm or injury absolutely

#s13
And I do n't have a problem at all with employers uh testing in the hiring process

#s14
but I I I do n't I do n't have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact

#s15
but I do a little bit where it where it would n't hurt anybody

#s16
I do n't know

#s17
sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far

#s19
But

#s21
Yeah

#s22
Right

#s24
and then it 's not a problem

#s26
Yeah

#s30
Oh absolutely

#s33
Oh yeah

#s34
Tr-

#s35
the train drivers

#s40
Yeah

#s42
I wish they would

#s43
I wish they would

#s44
and that I think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than than drugs so to speak

#s48
So

#s50
Oh I know

#s51
And

#s54
No

#s56
Just uh

#s57
Yeah

#s58
and

#s59
Now T I has the random testing policy

#s61
and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool

#s63
so I 've already been tested once when I was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program

#s66
But I work with one girl who was tested

#s67
her name got got randomly selected three times in six months

#s69
and I think that 's the only reason I have a problem with it when there 's no you know there 's no reason to suspect someone you know

#s71
That that 's getting a little bit

#s72
that 's enough to make anybody paranoid

#s75
Yeah

#s77
Right

#s80
Yeah

#s83
Either just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it

#s85
Oh absolutely

#s86
There are so many people with with their petty axes to grind

#s88
it could really get out of hand

#s93
Yeah

#s94
To report it

#s95
and I guess you 'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something because I I would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol

#s98
I 'd just I 'd feel really uncomfortable

#s103
Yeah

#s104
we have we have a lot of people who work on the line

#s105
I 'm in accounting

#s106
so it would n't

#s107
you know they could n't hurt me with their ten key or something

#s109
but out on the line they 've got people working some serious equipment

#s112
So

#s115
Put at risk

#s116
I agree totally

#s118
And in the long run we 're all paying for that

#s120
so it I mean it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that

#s122
I I was trying to remember

#s123
there was a court case uh here where I live just a few months ago

#s124
The city workers they wanted to um

#s125
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing

#s127
and the city workers uh took them to court to protest saying that it invaded their I guess first a- the the search and seizure amendment

#s130
and it 's still tied up in the legal channels

#s131
They have n't ruled on whether they can test them or not

#s133
So I 'm curious especially since T I -s a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what they 'll say about it especially since

#s136
Well it 's the whole it 's the whole city

#s137
seems like the whole group of city employees that 's raising a stink over it

#s139
Yeah

#s140
So

#s142
Yeah

#s144
Uh-huh

#s146
Right

#s148
Yeah

#s149
that 's the way I looked at it

#s150
If I had something to hide it 's one thing

#s151
but I 'm

#s152
you know you know you do n't

#s153
so it 's not as big a deal

#s154
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they 're really concerned about their rights or whether they 're really concerned about something else

#s158
I do n't believe that
