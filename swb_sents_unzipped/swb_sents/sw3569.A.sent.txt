Well uh until recently I was taking the WALL STREET JOURNAL

#s4
and I thought that was a good way

#s5
but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things

#s6
You know it 's a week or two late

#s7
but uh that 's how I 'm staying up

#s10
Uh do you like how it 's presented on the news

#s24
So it it makes you feel like they 're uh wanting you to take their opinion

#s27
Yeah

#s28
I 've noticed that too

#s29
and it 's kind of distressing is n't it

#s31
And they just I 've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report that you know by just a couple of words

#s34
So communications huh

#s35
Were you looking into becoming a reporter

#s36
or

#s40
Uh-huh

#s43
I bet that 's a interesting job

#s49
Yeah

#s50
there 's one that I 'm reading right now

#s51
It 's INFORMATION WEEK

#s52
It says A T and T to account for the the benefits that the A I C P A now says you have to show as a liability

#s53
It 's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three to account for that

#s55
And it 'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more

#s57
Yeah

#s58
it is

#s59
And yeah you have to stay up on stuff

#s60
and I bet in your your job that you have to

#s61
do you read the WALL STREET JOURNAL

#s75
Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective

#s83
I guess they do that so they do n't get scooped you know so they have the big story
