#s37
and it 's the western half of an island

#s38
with the eastern half that 's the Dominican Republic

#s40
And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries And study the language and then do a little service project

#s43
So yeah

#s44
that turned out to be a really good experience for me

#s46
Uh well see I went there when I was in high school actually

#s48
and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and uh hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp

#s50
Uh uh uh well not that much

#s51
Just uh

#s53
Right

#s54
I mean I was n't a great asset to them or anything

#s55
But I you know drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing

#s57
And uh yep

#s58
and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people 's home

#s59
and that was pretty interesting

#s60
And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were uh staying for their vacation in France in Nantes which is on the west coast like right across from England
