#s3
Yes

#s5
I try to whenever I can

#s6
I 've always been a a I guess a product of a handyman father

#s9
Th-

#s10
Yeah

#s11
Yeah

#s12
There 's

#s13
a- although I 'll tell you you know

#s14
over the years the cars get more complicated

#s16
Right

#s17
yeah

#s19
Yes

#s20
One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick Which after awhile I could you know take it apart in my sleep if I needed to

#s23
Yeah

#s24
It it got to be pretty straightforward to understand

#s25
and now since then you know the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick the the more I know about it

#s26
And then start getting into these Nissans and the like

#s27
and I just ca n't keep up

#s33
Yeah

#s35
That 's right

#s37
Yeah

#s38
Yeah

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
Yes

#s45
Yes

#s46
I understand

#s47
My last car repair actually had to do with brakes

#s48
and it 's one I did not do myself

#s49
I took the car my

#s50
I have a seventy-nine El Dorado

#s51
took it to be inspected

#s53
and the parking brake failed

#s54
So I got under there and messed with the the ten- that uh that adjustment to make to t- tighten it up

#s56
and that did n't do the trick

#s58
and then I got there and tried to

#s60
Well actually that was n't even eventually the problem

#s61
I I did a lot of things that I I did everything that I could think to do

#s63
And eventually I brought it up to a a place called Just Brakes

#s65
and it turns out that there 's a

#s66
the parking brake i- in the rear

#s67
there 's a there 's disc brakes

#s68
and the parking brake is a piston deal

#s70
And because the parking brake had n't been used in so many years the piston froze up

#s72
So they ended up having to pound it out

#s73
And one of them they were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it

#s74
and the other one they just it was just frozen solid

#s75
so I ended up having to buy one

#s76
and altog- all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done

#s79
Y- yeah

#s80
actually I I think it was a lot of money

#s81
but I I do n't

#s82
like I s-

#s85
Yeah

#s86
but I

#s87
it got to the point where I did n't know what was going on

#s88
so

#s90
That 's right

#s91
that 's right

#s94
I do

#s95
Th-

#s96
act- th- actually that was just a at at the beginning of September

#s97
and whenever I can I do try

#s98
I

#s99
a- actually I 'd say this

#s100
I I 've gotten to the point where I do n't change the oil anymore Only because

#s102
Well that is one problem

#s103
but also these uh these fast oil change places you just ca n't beat them

#s105
For sixteen bucks they 'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do a f- you know good a job as I can do but they 'll uh lube too

#s110
Yeah

#s112
Yep

#s113
that 's right
