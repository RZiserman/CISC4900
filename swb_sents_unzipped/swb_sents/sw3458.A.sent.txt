#s3
Yeah

#s6
Okay

#s7
Uh well we I guess we have to talk about magazines and uh what what

#s10
Well I subscribe to P- well I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time

#s11
I do you know

#s12
I enjoy PEOPLE

#s13
And now I 'm uh I uh subscribe to uh LADIES HOME JOURNAL

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Okay

#s17
are you interested in in computers

#s19
Yeah

#s20
Uh-huh

#s21
yeah

#s22
well that that would be one of my peeves

#s23
My pet peeves with magazines the woman 's magazines especially

#s24
I mean it 's it 's really geared to

#s25
all they have

#s26
you have too many recipes first of all

#s27
I just do n't you know

#s28
that 's what I do n't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines

#s29
Too many recipes too many uh can this marriage with saved nonsense

#s30
I you know I like to read articles about things that matter

#s31
Well of course PEOPLE magazine is not you know one of your uh your more intellectual magazines

#s32
but it 's nice light reading

#s33
You know if I want something intellectual I usually read a book

#s37
Well that 's true

#s38
yeah

#s39
they did

#s42
Yeah

#s44
Well is REDBOOK still in existence

#s45
I do n't know if they 're if they 're around anymore

#s51
Yeah

#s53
Well I 'll tell you

#s54
the only reason I bought the uh I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of

#s55
which I think it was either

#s56
yeah

#s57
it was Publisher 's Clearinghouse

#s59
They told me you know if I did n't subscribe they were going to take me off their their winning you know their list

#s60
So

#s63
Yeah

#s64
my last right my last chance to win ten million dollars

#s65
so I figured hey look

#s66
For twelve dollars you know

#s68
That 's it

#s69
Oh yeah

#s70
oh uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s76
Right

#s78
Uh-huh

#s81
Well I do n't know

#s82
I just think uh you know it 's It 's light reading

#s84
You know you do n't have well you do n't have to concentrate you know you know

#s87
It 's entertaining you know

#s88
and uh that 's

#s89
I just I enjoy it

#s90
I you know I uh

#s91
Well that ENTERTAINMENT is is very

#s92
was n't that similar or is n't it similar to to the TV GUIDE

#s98
Oh uh-huh

#s99
Oh I see

#s103
Oh

#s105
Oh

#s107
Right

#s108
right

#s109
Well I 'll tell you

#s110
since I 've been getting the JOURNAL like maybe maybe I 'll read two maybe three

#s111
if I read three articles in in you know one of the JOURNALs I figure you know I did really well

#s113
Because there 's just nothing in there that interests me

#s114
I do n't you know I do n't I 'm not into you know recipes

#s115
and

#s117
See now and I 'm not into crafts

#s118
so you know that that eliminates like three quarters of the magazine You know

#s120
Well I just got the new issue

#s121
they have Bette Midler on the cover

#s122
so that should be one article that I 'll read anyway
