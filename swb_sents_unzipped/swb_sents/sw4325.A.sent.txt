#s1
Okay

#s2
So What kind of experience do you do you have then with child care

#s4
Does it say something

#s10
Okay

#s11
Well Does it usually make a recording or s-

#s18
Okay

#s19
Okay

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
I have three

#s29
Uh-huh

#s30
Yeah

#s31
I do

#s32
Yes

#s33
uh I do n't work though

#s34
but I used to work and when I had two children

#s36
I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit

#s37
but I do n't envy anybody who 's in that situation to find day care

#s39
But does your sister live in a big community

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Oh really

#s49
Uh-huh

#s52
Um

#s55
Uh-huh

#s58
Wow

#s59
How lucky

#s60
I I know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids

#s62
and but the community I 'm in is not a real large one

#s63
so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that you know

#s64
you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to

#s67
Yeah

#s68
to get references and that

#s69
so but uh

#s70
I I d- do n't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because there 's so many kids and so many

#s72
Yeah

#s73
and uh you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things

#s75
but and they 're expensive

#s76
and course there 's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things

#s78
Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that

#s79
but

#s80
take a long time to find the right place

#s83
Uh-huh

#s85
Uh-huh

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
when he starts toddling around and stuff

#s90
Yeah

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
It would be hard

#s96
I think it would be kind of stressful

#s97
It would be nice to have him around

#s99
but uh seems like you know

#s100
goll-

#s101
what if he cried at the wrong time

#s102
or the phone rang or you know at the wrong time

#s104
But

#s106
Uh-huh

#s107
Well when you have kids will you work

#s108
Do you work now

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
Uh-huh

#s116
Uh yeah

#s117
Actually I teach my kids at home

#s118
so I 'm here all the time

#s124
Uh-huh

#s125
Yeah

#s126
yeah

#s128
So

#s130
Not

#s131
it depends on the state you live actually

#s132
Some laws absolutely prohibit it

#s133
Some states uh say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that

#s134
Our state does n't yet say that

#s135
and I 'm not a certified teacher

#s136
I went to college

#s137
but I you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now

#s138
and so

#s140
One of them was for a couple of years

#s141
and so you know my oldest he was

#s142
and then my youngest two have never been

#s144
So anyway

#s145
but we do n't
