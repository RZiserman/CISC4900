#s2
Uh more than likely it 's going to be a Chrysler

#s4
Uh Chrysler LeBaron

#s5
yeah

#s6
It wo n't be a Ford

#s7
I 've got a Ford Mustang now

#s8
and I hate it

#s10
Yeah

#s12
It 's a eighty-eight

#s14
It 's um

#s15
I 've had one problem with it after the other

#s17
The pa- the paint 's peeling off of it

#s18
and there 's no reason for it you know

#s19
Fix or repair daily or find them re- road dead

#s23
That uh

#s24
I uh

#s25
it 's

#s26
my electrical system shorted out like two or three times

#s27
and it 's been torn up since April

#s28
and I and luckily everything was under warranty

#s29
so it 's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed

#s30
It would have been like two thousand

#s35
Those those are nice cars

#s38
Um the gas mileage for one thing

#s39
and I 've I 've I 've always had like stick shift

#s40
I want to the next car I get I want it to be automatic

#s42
I uh I hate driving anyway

#s43
and then and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now

#s46
Yeah

#s47
And you know when you work nine to five or eight to five and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately

#s49
And I look

#s50
and one of the things with Chrysler right now is is their the warranties that they have

#s51
and I I feel like their

#s52
everybody I 've talked to that owns one has has has been real pleased with it

#s53
and I like the the driver 's air bag

#s54
I like that

#s56
Uh yeah

#s57
well all Chrysler products has it in there

#s58
but LeBaron would be the next car I get

#s59
yeah

#s62
Yeah

#s63
yeah

#s64
I like I like that too huh

#s65
but uh I I could n't afford the insurance on one of those

#s69
Yeah

#s76
Well that 's what I 'm paying on mine now

#s77
I had to get like a first time

#s78
my dad 's always cosigned on on my my loans or whatever

#s79
and this is one

#s80
when bought

#s81
I got my Mustang this time was by myself because I got on my own or whatever

#s82
and um I had said

#s83
they they said it had to be like a first time buyer 's car or whatever

#s84
and they 're charging me unreasonable MUMBLEx interest

#s85
but I 've got eight more payments

#s86
and it 's paid for

#s88
But I got it when I got it when the eighty-eights first came out

#s89
it 's a it 's it 's a good car

#s90
I mean I got in eighty-seven I guess in like November or something like that

#s91
and

#s98
Uh-huh

#s109
Well that 's another big factor of mine

#s110
Next next car I get 's going to be a four door too Something with some room

#s112
Because I my Mustang is is is two door with bucket seats

#s113
and you buy groceries and stuff like that
