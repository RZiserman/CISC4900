#s1
Uh well h- having

#s2
sort of the reason we 're going through the school system

#s3
I seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing

#s4
I 'm I 'm just graduating col- graduating from college

#s5
Uh I did n't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system

#s6
However when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and ad-

#s7
you can compare just about everyth- thing to Japan

#s8
and we look like wh- we do n't have anything

#s9
Uh it seems to be not difficult enough for students Not challenging enough And just not generally competitive enough

#s10
Uh however I if it were n't for our needless uh competition with Japan I I 'd I 'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace

#s14
Uh-huh

#s20
Right

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Huh

#s31
Right

#s33
Uh well I do n't pretend to understand that either

#s34
Uh but I 'm not quite sure that it 's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools

#s35
But then again I 'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put Uh because the the dropout rate is in those areas w-

#s36
it 's high in those areas where also there 's poverty and and crime

#s37
And they all seem to go together

#s38
And it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle whether where you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better

#s39
So uh a- the other two a- a-

#s40
they 're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways And clearly to me is a kind of government thing to to fix

#s41
but it 's just like I I do n't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like I do n't know

#s42
It 's it 's a complicated issue

#s43
I I still do n't think I would blame it directly on the school

#s47
Well that 's I meant when I said the school

#s52
Huh

#s53
Well that 's odd because I do n't think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid

#s60
Uh-huh

#s63
Yeah

#s64
Well it it

#s71
Right

#s77
Yeah

#s78
well that 's true

#s79
But tha- there 's

#s80
you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this

#s81
My tax dollars are paying for this

#s82
This is wrong

#s83
But when you 're talk- w-

#s84
and there 's really not much you can directly do about that

#s85
I think that that if if there is a problem with the school system uh from it 's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh paid That perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved

#s86
Uh w-

#s87
you have other professional jobs

#s88
and th- this is a profession

#s89
And as a matter of fact it 's a pretty big influence on on
