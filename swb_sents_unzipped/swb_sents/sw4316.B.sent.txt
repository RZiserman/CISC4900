#s5
Uh yeah

#s6
yeah

#s7
Uh well uh out of control I do n't know

#s8
I guess it could be worse

#s9
Uh we 've uh we 've we 've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood

#s10
Uh I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington

#s11
Uh there 's uh there 's a lot of problems

#s12
I mean there 's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people

#s13
and uh you know we get c- cars on our block uh regularly uh uh g- uh gone through rifled through and stuff

#s15
Yeah

#s17
Yeah

#s18
you figured it was like Omaha right

#s21
No

#s22
it 's uh it 's not Newark

#s23
but uh yeah

#s24
it 's got problems

#s28
Yeah

#s29
I think most people regard it as a warehouse Where you put away the people that are so bad that uh you do n't want them out in circulation

#s34
Yeah

#s36
That 's what I hear

#s38
Yeah

#s39
I I think you know

#s40
do n't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea

#s43
Yeah

#s47
Oh you mean she taught in a prison

#s49
Oh

#s51
I see

#s52
uh

#s56
Yeah

#s57
the b- the bureaucracy

#s63
Uh

#s67
Yeah

#s69
So she did n't feel safe

#s76
Yeah

#s80
Yeah

#s81
right

#s83
Well at least it 's maximum security right

#s88
Uh well I I think the people that run yeah that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical you know

#s90
I mean I uh you know I I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff

#s91
and it 's uh

#s92
you can get pretty hardened I 'm sure

#s95
but

#s96
Yeah

#s99
Those are funny labels see

#s101
Oh yeah

#s102
Oh Oh yeah

#s103
absolutely

#s104
I think uh yeah I think you can blame it on social problems

#s105
Sure

#s107
I mean as as you know as poverty has gotten worse as you know education has gotten worse as there 's been more single parent families as there 's been more homelessness there 's m- been more crime

#s109
Yeah

#s110
there 's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse

#s111
and yep

#s112
it 's a mess

#s116
Is he the guy wants to like deregulate heroin or something
