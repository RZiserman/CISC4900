#s1
Okay

#s2
Uh do you live in a home

#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Oh did you

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
We 've lived in ours for about six years

#s11
We had it built actually

#s13
And uh uh it 's our first home too

#s15
Yeah

#s17
Um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in

#s19
and um that was quite an experience

#s20
I I much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy

#s22
Yeah

#s24
Um it 's uh uh it 's like twenty-four fifty square feet

#s27
It 's a two story

#s29
Yeah

#s30
How about yours

#s32
Is it small

#s36
Oh really

#s39
Oh uh-huh

#s40
Do you do you have children

#s42
Just one

#s44
Oh

#s48
Oh uh-huh

#s49
Yeah

#s53
Oh yeah

#s54
yeah

#s55
Well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood

#s60
Oh uh-huh

#s65
Yeah

#s66
Yeah

#s68
Uh

#s69
Yeah

#s70
it it it it does it it seems about oh probably average

#s71
Um

#s74
But our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people

#s75
and you know there 's older people here and and um people that are our our age

#s76
we 're in our thirties

#s78
And um there 's a lot of kids a lot of kids

#s79
MUMBLEx People across the street have eight

#s82
Uh-huh

#s84
Yeah

#s85
their home just burned down matter of fact and um last summer

#s87
and they 're just rebuilding

#s88
and um their house is going to be really big

#s89
It 's

#s92
Yeah

#s93
they 're building a lot bigger

#s94
He 's uh um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon

#s96
And um so since the house did burn they 're they 're going

#s97
it 's quite different than it was before

#s98
and it 's it 's a lot bigger

#s101
And um but ours is about

#s102
it 's you know it 's a nice home

#s103
it 's definitely not one of the the smaller ones

#s104
and um it 's not the biggest either

#s105
But

#s111
Oh

#s113
Yeah

#s116
Yeah

#s117
You

#s119
You know that 's interesting you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here

#s121
and when we um put out house in um they wanted us to have

#s122
there was one

#s123
we have part siding on on the two story part and then on the back

#s126
and they there was one side where our chimney was

#s127
and just the chimney was going to be brick

#s128
and they wanted us to have more brick

#s129
so we ended up having to go halfway up

#s131
which it does look nicer

#s132
and you know we would have like to have had all brick

#s133
but of course at that point we could n't afford it

#s134
and but it 's funny that you 'd say that because there were homes in here that did n't have any brick at all

#s136
So it 's kind of like they were

#s138
Yeah

#s139
yeah

#s140
and I and so it was kind of like it 's they

#s141
ours is the last street that they built on

#s142
So the houses actually on our street are a little bit they 're kind of gone a little bit nicer

#s146
Yeah

#s147
I mean just they you know

#s150
it 's like the second phase

#s152
and and so they 've kind of changed the the codes a little bit

#s153
and so that 's kind of why I guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that did n't have any

#s156
Oh uh-huh
