#s1
Yes um

#s2
I I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job

#s3
I mean at least their plans have are good

#s4
Um how- however I was

#s5
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that um they 've had some problems with the recycling on plastic

#s7
uh-huh

#s8
I thought that was most interesting

#s10
Yeah

#s11
Yes

#s13
Yeah

#s14
That 's right

#s16
Yeah

#s17
I guess that 's going to happen

#s18
Yeah

#s19
a really good effort

#s20
that 's right

#s21
yeah

#s23
Well I was thinking about the other day um

#s24
when I when Dick and I were oh many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri um I went oh

#s25
I was probably this was probably

#s26
see it been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight um

#s27
we I went to a meeting

#s28
and uh one of the the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling

#s29
and um she was from Saint Louis

#s31
and she had this fantastic um family effort in in recycling

#s32
and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum

#s34
and I thought wow I mean how one person is doing that you know

#s35
but my my thought was it 's a shame

#s36
I mean it 's wonderful that she 's doing it and it

#s37
but would n't it be mu- much nicer if we all did it

#s38
because her effort would have really um really uh been a good example for all of us

#s39
And yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time

#s40
And here we are you know

#s41
now we 're doing it on a city wide basis in in communities

#s43
So it 's wonderful that we 've come that far I think

#s44
but Um

#s50
I think she was

#s51
I was trying to remember

#s52
it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in Saint Louis

#s53
there were places where she could actually take her uh things herself uh

#s55
and so it was n't you know something that was being picked up

#s56
or um and I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would

#s57
But I remember her saying yes I have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing

#s58
and I thought wow that 's that is wonderful that somebody MUMBLEx does that

#s60
Yeah

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
Right

#s66
Yes

#s71
Sure you do

#s72
uh-huh

#s73
Yeah

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
Is n't that amazing

#s78
Well you know

#s79
Yes

#s81
People I do n't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort

#s83
Yeah

#s85
I do n't know

#s86
It 's it 's

#s87
I under- I know what you 're saying

#s88
kind of people like that

#s89
and Well sure it is

#s94
Yep

#s96
Yeah

#s97
it 's on down the line

#s98
Right

#s100
Yes

#s101
Yeah

#s103
I agree

#s104
When

#s109
Uh-huh

#s111
Yeah

#s113
Sure

#s118
Yeah

#s119
Right

#s121
Yeah

#s122
Well I know um

#s123
I guess I got a good example from my mother

#s124
because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things

#s125
and she is to this day

#s126
and you know I mean she 'll even

#s128
um if she

#s129
for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies

#s130
it would go on that

#s131
or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she 'd use that

#s134
She just she recycles everything

#s135
And I have done the same thing

#s136
I recycle like zip lock bags and things like that

#s138
My kids get the biggest kick out of that

#s139
Although they do the same thing

#s140
I mean they I think they give me a hard time

#s142
but I think they know that that 's it 's the right way

#s147
Uh-huh

#s148
Yes

#s149
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that

#s150
Yeah

#s151
That 's right

#s154
That 's true

#s155
yeah

#s156
Well I do n't know you know

#s157
I I wonder how how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work I mean the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually uh making sure that uh you take stuff over to you know

#s158
some people are compl- now are complaining because the stuff is n't picked up at the curbside you know

#s159
and I think golly Moses you just do your part

#s160
You know people are not

#s161
you you you ca n't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- work ou- out

#s166
No

#s167
that 's right

#s170
Uh-huh

#s171
Right

#s172
Yeah

#s173
yeah

#s175
Yes

#s176
Uh-huh

#s179
Yeah

#s181
Yeah

#s182
yeah

#s183
Uh-huh

#s185
Uh-huh

#s186
Uh-huh

#s187
No

#s189
Uh Uh-huh

#s192
Yeah

#s193
Yeah

#s194
right

#s195
do those little things

#s196
yeah

#s198
that make a lot of difference

#s199
uh-huh

#s200
Yeah

#s201
Yeah

#s202
it 's I you know

#s203
and I think you 're right though

#s205
I think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes

#s207
Or you have to grow up with it being im- important in your life um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes

#s209
And um I do n't know

#s210
it 's uh it 's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am than I even myself than I used to be a few years ago

#s212
I mean like I I 'd go to the um to the U T D um cafeteria for lunch sometimes

#s214
and they use styrofoam plates when they would n't need to use styrofoam plates

#s217
You know and I think to myself that 's that 's crazy

#s218
I wonder if you know maybe I need to bring that to someone 's attention you know

#s221
and and uh I 'm seeing more and more of that

#s222
and and I think it 's uh just McDonald 's effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff

#s224
I think is a good good example you know that even industry is willing to do it

#s227
Yeah

#s228
Well I think that may that 's kind of what it 's coming to I 'm sure

#s231
Yeah

#s232
Oh yeah

#s233
That 's right

#s234
yeah

#s237
Uh-huh

#s238
Wow

#s239
That does n't would n't surprise me

#s240
Uh-huh

#s242
Yeah

#s243
yeah

#s244
Uh I know it

#s246
and unfortunately
