#s1
Push my number

#s2
Okay

#s6
Oh I 'm a

#s7
I play golf

#s8
but I do n't actually play golf

#s11
Yeah

#s12
Hack it all over the place

#s14
It 's sickening is n't it

#s16
Yeah

#s17
We 've got tons up here

#s18
but I do n't know

#s19
How do you feel about your game

#s20
I guess that 's a good question

#s27
Yeah

#s29
Yeah

#s30
I like that too

#s32
I do n't know

#s33
I try to play

#s34
but God I a couple years ago I played two three times a week and got lousy

#s35
I guess that 's the best I ever got was lousy

#s36
And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come

#s37
and then I got worse again

#s38
so

#s40
Yeah

#s46
That 's pretty good

#s49
Um I 'm that and worse

#s50
I I play

#s51
next year I

#s52
actually I take it kind of seriously

#s53
but I 've been doing so bad

#s54
Next year I always say this every year but next year I 'm starting over from scratch

#s55
I 'm going to go take lessons and everything

#s56
I 'm going to do it right and see if I can actually play this game or not

#s61
Yeah

#s62
what do you do when you 're putting

#s63
That 's a good thing

#s64
That 's something I could learn actually

#s65
That 's when I do my worst

#s66
I finally get to the green

#s67
and I think I 'm doing all all fine

#s68
and then

#s71
Yeah

#s73
Can you really see it though

#s75
What about the speed

#s77
Can you tell ho- no- but can you tell how how fast you 're going to hit it

#s81
Yeah

#s82
but you can feel that

#s84
I do n't know

#s85
I have I can gi- get it within like you know four or five feet or something

#s86
but I do n't have enough field

#s87
Now I 'm T V watching

#s89
They make you die at the hole every time

#s91
Oh it just dies and rolls in

#s92
I do n't know

#s94
it 's hard for me

#s102
Once you 're there you 're all set though

#s104
We should play team golf then

#s105
I 'll get us there

#s106
and you put it in

#s108
I s-

#s109
oh the T V golfers they do that

#s110
It takes them two to get there and two to get it in

#s111
so it 's fifty percent

#s112
And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in

#s118
Yeah

#s119
That 's good

#s122
Joe Pros

#s126
That 's pretty good

#s127
For eighteen

#s130
Wow

#s131
that 's pretty good

#s133
I 'm talking to the wrong guy

#s134
Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I 've ever seen

#s143
If when I 'm in the nineties I 'm feeling good

#s144
I 'm usually around a hundred

#s145
That 's my thing Around a hundred

#s146
You know I can hit a great drives and think I 'm going to do all awesome on this hole

#s147
but it ai n't going to happen

#s150
Well it 's a good thing with me I slice it every single time

#s151
That 's good

#s152
I aim
