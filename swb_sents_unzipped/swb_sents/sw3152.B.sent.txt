#s5
Well

#s7
Oh well my favorite well

#s8
I I do n't really have a favorite

#s9
I I like everything basically

#s10
Um I guess if I had to pick it would be like pop I would think

#s11
but I like everything

#s12
So it 's kind of hard to choose sometimes

#s17
Uh-huh

#s22
Yeah

#s24
I grew up next door to uh the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader

#s25
so

#s27
Yeah

#s29
So we used to go and listen to them all the time

#s30
and my parents still do

#s32
So I grew up with a lot of his music and and what not

#s33
Plus my parents are well

#s34
especially my dad likes a lot of classical music

#s35
and he introduced my brother and I both to a lot of it

#s36
So

#s40
Yeah

#s42
Sure did

#s45
Yeah

#s46
We all went to high school together

#s47
and uh and we 're still in contact with each other

#s49
We all go back to parents ' houses on the weekends and what not

#s50
so

#s54
Oh really

#s57
It is a small world is n't it

#s61
Yeah

#s62
he 's a pretty nice guy

#s64
Yeah

#s65
well I never I had to work for him

#s66
and I never would want to work for him

#s67
So

#s75
Yeah

#s76
he sure is

#s77
he just became a grandfather

#s81
Uh uh-huh

#s82
Yeah

#s83
they just had the baby 's christening

#s84
so

#s86
It was really nice

#s87
so

#s89
He 's a little boy

#s92
I ca n't

#s93
it it 's a

#s94
oh gosh

#s95
it 's like Elijah or something like that

#s97
I keep forgetting what what she named him

#s99
His middle name is Chris or Christopher for for her daddy

#s101
but I think it 's Elijah

#s103
It starts with an E

#s106
I ca n't remember

#s108
Yes

#s110
Yeah

#s111
we 've heard them and liked liked it real well of course

#s113
Um actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord

#s115
I really like those

#s116
in fact I had a harpsichord played at my wedding

#s118
Yeah

#s120
Which was real nice

#s121
I got married uh during the Christmas season

#s122
and we played uh old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not

#s123
and it was real nice

#s124
I liked that a lot

#s126
I liked the sound of the harpsichord

#s128
No

#s129
somebody played it

#s131
No

#s132
no

#s133
no

#s134
no

#s135
no

#s136
Just by itself

#s137
just by itself

#s140
It was real nice

#s142
Yeah

#s143
It went well

#s144
it was a change you know from your traditional normal you know stuff and since it was Christmas time and and uh we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that

#s145
and so we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional Christmas carols

#s147
Not not you know the bouncy you know sing along kind but some of the old older ones that

#s150
some I do n't even I recognize the the melodies and whatnot

#s151
but I did n't recognize the name

#s153
So it was real nice

#s155
Um

#s157
Uh-huh

#s162
It does

#s163
It really does

#s164
and it has such a different sound to it anyway

#s165
It 's almost

#s166
I do n't know the way it vibrates

#s167
it 's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes

#s168
It it 's

#s169
I I like it

#s171
I do n't know how else to explain

#s172
But we 've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas

#s173
they 're uh called Odessa

#s174
It 's a husband and wife team that we 've known for years

#s175
and uh we try to make contact with them periodically to see what 's going on and stuff too

#s176
so we 've had a lot of stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant

#s177
plus my husband 's real big into music too

#s178
so He does n't play anything

#s179
but he just likes to listen

#s181
And my dad and

#s182
my kids are now well

#s183
my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs

#s184
and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast

#s185
and

#s188
Yeah

#s189
well my my oldest is only nine

#s191
So h- he has n't really gotten into um that yet

#s192
They have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to

#s194
but um he 's not old enough yet to get into the band yet

#s196
So

#s198
I think that starts in sixth grade

#s201
So

#s203
but I do n't know

#s204
He he 's he the only thing he 's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums

#s205
cause his my brother plays

#s206
and um I do n't I do n't know if he 's really serious about it yet or not you know

#s207
it 's just one of those things I 'm just going to wait and see if he 's interested in something you know

#s213
Yeah

#s214
just a little bit

#s219
Uh

#s226
Really

#s229
Yeah

#s231
I do n't know if any of mine will be interested in it

#s232
or

#
