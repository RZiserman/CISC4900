#s1
So uh do you happen to be working for a large firm

#s5
Uh-huh

#s8
Yeah

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh I work for a fairly large company

#s15
It 's got eight thousand people

#s17
And uh we do have health insurance

#s18
We do n't have four O k- one K plan stuff like that

#s19
but we do have like retirement

#s20
They kind of match up to you

#s21
if you put six percent they match up to six percent

#s22
and then the rest is whatever you want to put in If you put more than that or something like that

#s24
It 's not bad

#s26
God I do n't know

#s27
It 's probably a long time

#s28
I 'm sure it 's not till like twenty-five years thirty years

#s32
Yeah

#s33
Huh well I guess what we have is like a f- what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need

#s34
Otherwise you can uh guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed or can just have that money you know put in your paycheck

#s41
Yeah

#s42
well it depends on which company you work for

#s43
I know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you uh think you call it plan D

#s44
Deductibles are really high

#s45
it 's like fifteen hundred dollars

#s46
but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because it 's unlikely if you 're f- relatively uh healthy then it 's really unlikely that you 'd use that much amount of money you know

#s47
So the- it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis

#s48
and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and and take a loss what- whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual

#s54
Um

#s55
Really

#s56
You mean not even your your your car insurance

#s61
Oh that 's too bad

#s63
Yeah

#s64
uh well I do n't know

#s65
I think other than health insurance I think uh you know an extra week of uh time off would be nice

#s66
I only get two weeks

#s71
Oh that 's nice

#s72
We do n't get them till till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week

#s75
Yeah

#s76
it 's uh

#s80
Uh with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used to be much more stable

#s81
It 's a lot less stable than it used to be

#s82
They used to have job security crap

#s83
but now they do n't

#s85
Yeah

#s86
it 's the Bell Corps which is uh

#s88
Yeah

#s90
So I do n't know

#s91
it 's it 's uh no longer

#s92
So that 's what

#s93
I think it 's still based on the old model of

#s94
and and now they do n't uh

#s97
Yeah

#s99
Yeah

#s100
but they no no longer

#s101
I do n't think so

#s103
Uh hearing a lo-

#s104
there 's always they 're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security

#s107
Oh I do n't know

#s108
we do n't we have n't been doing layoffs

#s109
We 've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management

#s110
And uh I do n't know what they do for those people

#s112
Some of it

#s113
yeah

#s115
There 's too many manage too many chiefs and not enough Indians

#s116
but
