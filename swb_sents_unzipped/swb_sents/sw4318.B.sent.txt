#s6
Are you really

#s11
Uh-huh

#s12
which are both kind of small

#s16
Uh-huh

#s17
Are you looking for an American car

#s18
or you open to buying foreign cars

#s20
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s25
Right

#s26
Personally I have a Japanese car right now

#s27
and I really like it a lot

#s28
Uh I think the Japanese really build good cars

#s30
and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now

#s31
but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while

#s33
If I were to buy another car I would be uh I would be partial to buying another Japanese car

#s34
but I would also look at American cars

#s35
but when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also

#s36
and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product

#s39
So if I were

#s40
Right

#s45
Right

#s46
it is

#s47
Uh I 'm kind of

#s48
right now

#s49
the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car

#s50
I would really like to have a sports car

#s51
Uh I do n't really I do n't have a family

#s52
so I do n't need a a mini van or such to uh haul people around in

#s54
So I 'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh

#s56
Well I like the Miata

#s57
but I do n't like it enough to buy it

#s58
I would buy something

#s59
actually the the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car

#s61
But uh something along that lines

#s63
Uh because I have a an economy car right now which is okay

#s64
but uh I think I I 'd like to move on to something a little better

#s69
Right

#s71
Right

#s73
That 's

#s74
when I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage

#s75
and I was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time I was g- that I would get a for the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was that was worth that money

#s77
So

#s80
Right

#s81
exactly

#s83
Yeah

#s85
That 's right

#s87
Uh-huh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s93
Uh-huh

#s95
Okay

#s96
Uh I 've had uh I 've had one or two American cars I think

#s97
and and they were okay

#s98
I had a Pontiac once

#s99
and and I never had a problem with it

#s100
but uh my mother had a Dodge at one point

#s101
and I I had driven it a few times

#s102
and I really did not feel that it that I would buy a Dodge j- just from

#s104
well actually I had a uh a Dodge Omni at one point

#s106
and that was I think what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality uh car

#s108
So I guess you 'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car

#s115
Uh-huh

#s116
Right

#s118
Which is a good deal

#s123
Uh-huh

#s125
Right

#s128
Yeah

#s129
that

#s133
Yeah

#s134
I 'm sure they did

#s138
Uh-huh

#s139
Right
