Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an uh nursing home now

#s6
Do you

#s7
I have a grandmother

#s8
She 's a hundred and two

#s10
She 'll be a hundred and three in August

#s12
And we decide not to put her in a nursing home

#s13
She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town

#s14
and then my sister takes care of her

#s16
She even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties

#s18
She still has her snap

#s19
She takes care of her own business

#s20
This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker

#s21
but with somebody that needs around the clock care

#s22
I have seen my family age

#s24
I have seen them in the

#s25
she 's been there ten years now

#s26
And I have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything

#s28
I th- I still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home

#s29
and they needed some quality care

#s30
I would put someone in a nursing home

#s38
Uh-huh

#s43
Oh well that 's good

#s47
Oh that is great

#s64
Oh why yeah

#s65
I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas

#s74
Uh-huh

#s75
I I know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin

#s82
And the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have well you have to be a pauper

#s84
It it takes every penny

#s85
They want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care

#s88
And that 's the sad part about it

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
I think that 's what most people do

#s102
You just have to give it everything away

#s105
I I work at a brokerage firm

#s106
and I have seen so many people that just have to gift you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home

#s114
I ca n't imagine

#s115
I 'm twenty-nine

#s117
And everybody in my family has always had

#s118
we do n't have any children

#s119
Everybody that has has them later in life

#s121
So my my mother and my father are in their late sixties

#s122
So I mean they 're not that far away

#s127
Oh I know

#s133
It

#s134
but yeah

#s135
Most people are n't

#s139
And that 's the bad thing

#s140
I would hate to have lived so long

#s141
She lived by herself

#s142
My grandfather passed away before I was born

#s143
so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety-one And just did everything
