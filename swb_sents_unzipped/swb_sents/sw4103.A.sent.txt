Uh the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and monthly budget

#s2
The only thing I do now is uh put the data into Quicken

#s3
I do n't know if you are familiar with that

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Um I 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then well uh uh not bother to total it

#s12
and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic

#s13
So it helps with that

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
Well actually we have n't had to Uh until just recently

#s23
I guess we 've got a a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way

#s24
so we needed to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that

#s26
We tried a way try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that

#s33
Uh-huh

#s35
Um

#s37
Um Sounds good

#s38
Yeah

#s39
I guess we 're we 're just at the point

#s40
uh my wife worked until we had a family

#s41
and then you know now we 're just going on the one income

#s42
so it 's a lot more interesting trying to uh

#s44
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to uh do it

#s45
You know kind of enforce the savings

#s47
But uh it will be interesting to see

#s50
Um

#s52
Um

#s53
That sounds good

#s54
But uh uh I was just curious what uh part of the country

#s56
Oh okay

#s58
Uh Cincinnati actually

#s59
I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that

#s60
I do n't know how many people are uh getting involved in this

#s61
but uh well that 's interesting

#s63
I 'm uh uh actually uh I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading TELECOM DIGEST

#s64
or was there another

#s66
Oh okay

#s67
Yeah

#s68
that is how I got it as well

#s69
but uh

#s72
Uh-huh

#s74
Yeah

#s75
it will be interesting to see what It be interesting to see how the data base

#s76
so well I guess we 're talking about the experiment

#s78
Uh probably need to try to get back on the topic

#s79
but uh it 's hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures I guess you know

#s81
we could talk about some of the long range goals

#s82
and

#s84
Uh well I think either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point

#s86
uh I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that

#s87
It seems like every year my employer just gives back you know a little bit your tuition reimbursement

#s89
I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent

#s90
and now it 's uh now it 's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class

#s91
and uh it 's a real shame from what we had before uh because we 're
