Uh we have a Sheltie Collie a miniature Sheltie

#s3
Yeah

#s4
It 's about oh about six months old

#s5
and we 're try-

#s6
we live in an apartment

#s7
so we do n't have a yard

#s8
so it has to stay inside

#s9
and we 're having a difficult time trying to train it

#s11
It 's about six months

#s13
Really

#s14
But they 're supposed to be real intelligent dogs

#s15
but I guess every one one one one of them or every once in a while you get one that 's not so intelligent because this one it

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s25
so how 'd you all how do you

#s26
what 's the best method

#s30
Right

#s33
Stand outside with them until they

#s36
Well we 're hardly ever at home

#s37
so it 's kind of difficult

#s39
and you know you do n't want to you do n't want to spank it or scare it or anything like that

#s40
so

#s45
Yeah

#s46
we we try to take it you know

#s47
it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside

#s48
and you know and then it runs right inside

#s50
and it does it Huh

#s52
Yeah

#s53
a lot of times

#s54
and you know it wo n't it 's little job outside

#s56
and it comes inside

#s58
Uh yeah

#s59
we 've tried that

#s60
and uh you know there 's certain spots in the house where he likes to go

#s62
so and he chews on plants and all that

#s63
but you know that 's natural for a little puppy Huh

#s69
Oh really

#s71
Oh that 's sad

#s76
How old is it

#s78
Man that 's sad

#s81
Oh of course not

#s83
I could n't

#s88
That is really sad

#s89
What what 's the deal

#s90
we we try to we 're trying to take it on walks now you know

#s92
and we ca n't because it 's not accustomed to being on a leash

#s94
and so it I mean this dog really feels like it 's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it

#s95
I mean it just goes like a mad dog

#s96
I mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping

#s97
and it 's you know I mean it 's not even close to even being trained on a leash

#s101
Uh-huh

#s102
Well we 've heard bad we 've heard some bad things about some of those you know

#s103
they sometimes mis- misuse their license or whatever you know

#s105
they treat them bad

#s107
Oh really

#s111
Oh really

#s116
Uh-huh

#s120
How long did it take

#s122
Every what

#s124
Oh really

#s127
Well Sheltie Collies are you know timid

#s128
and they do n't really

#s129
unless they get used to something they 're really nervous

#s130
and

#s133
Yeah

#s134
yeah

#s135
and uh if they 're not accustomed to something they they 're really scared

#s136
So
