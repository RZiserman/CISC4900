#s1
Okay um

#s2
do you have any pets now

#s8
Yeah

#s10
Oh okay

#s11
Um that

#s13
a matter of choice or compulsion

#s17
Yeah

#s19
Yeah

#s23
Yeah

#s25
Yeah

#s26
Well right now I 'm a student

#s27
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that

#s29
No

#s30
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat

#s32
Yeah

#s33
They 're very strict about it

#s35
Oh I love animals

#s37
I was raised

#s38
our house when I when I was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house

#s40
It was al- almost always at least one cat sometimes you know like fifteen or twenty

#s41
But uh always cats in the house

#s44
Oh

#s47
Yeah

#s52
How old are your kids

#s54
Okay

#s56
One

#s58
Our first

#s59
He 's about te- eleven weeks now

#s61
Yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s65
Uh originally

#s67
West Virginia

#s69
Um I do n't know how familiar you are with that area of the country

#s70
but

#s72
Charleston West Virginia

#s75
Okay

#s76
that 's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway

#s78
Okay

#s79
in the north end of the state you 've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania

#s81
Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown

#s85
Yeah

#s87
yeah

#s88
It 's

#s89
well um my parents ' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far

#s92
So

#s94
Oh it 's beautiful

#s96
Uh well from my neck of the woods it 's hilly

#s98
Um you know uh maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation uh type variations from the valleys up to the hills the hilltops

#s101
Um not a lot of farmland there

#s102
Mostly it 's uh

#s103
I mean you know there 's you know individuals with their own own f- uh growing their own food

#s104
Uh most of the agriculture it 's more in the way of uh sheep and cattle

#s106
And even that 's you know small time mostly

#s108
Uh the biggest chunk of what 's going on there is is uh industry

#s110
It 's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants

#s112
Uh aluminum plants

#s113
There 's like two aluminum plants MUMBLEx

#s115
Computer engineering

#s118
Uh just finished up my fourth semester

#s120
Yeah

#s123
Yeah

#s124
it 's a big change

#s126
I spent twenty years as a mechanic

#s128
so

#s130
Yeah

#s132
Yeah

#s135
I 'm working on a bachelor 's degree

#s138
I 'm working on a bachelor 's degree

#s139
It 'll be compu-

#s141
Pardon

#s143
Uh it seems to me from what I 've been able to find out

#s146
That 's considered a pretty good program

#s147
It 's nice and small which means you know if you do n't get the class this semester then you 've got to wait or three or four s- you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again

#s149
But uh i- it 's worth it once you get it

#s153
Oh yeah

#s154
yeah

#s156
Most the class are pretty small

#s158
That works out real well

#s161
Uh well um first off we 'd probably wind up with a a cat or maybe a puppy

#s163
I I I 'm partial towards the larger dogs

#s165
Um our last we 've we 've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus

#s167
Uh had a hamster or two

#s168
and they they got to be a lot of fun

#s171
Uh it 's amazing how much character
