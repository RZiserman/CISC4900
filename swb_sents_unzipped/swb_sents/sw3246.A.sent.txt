Do you see anything wrong with public school systems

#s6
I agree

#s9
Yes

#s10
and I taught for fourteen years before we moved to Texas

#s12
and the the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much

#s13
I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students

#s14
and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms for all the children

#s17
everything had to be documented

#s18
and I had file cabinets that were n't filled with neat stuff for kids

#s19
it was filled with documentation

#s21
yes

#s25
Me too

#s29
I think so too

#s31
They 're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency you know

#s33
and it 's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best

#s34
she 's always worried who 's looking over her shoulder

#s35
and

#s37
That 's right

#s38
I know

#s42
That 's right

#s43
Do you have children in the system

#s49
Oh

#s52
Yep

#s53
Are you in Plano

#s55
Yep

#s56
I am too

#s58
And I have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year

#s59
and he my nin- my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews

#s60
and the very first year I taught back in seventy-three we had open classroom

#s61
and it did n't work then

#s63
and when we moved down here I was just appalled that they were still doing it here

#s69
Partitions

#s70
or just to face the children different directions or to do something

#s73
I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school

#s75
so he spent all day in this one large open area

#s77
so I did n't really care for that

#s78
It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here

#s80
That was our last tour in Michigan

#s84
Oh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s90
Oh wow

#s92
Yes

#s95
Yes

#s96
that 's right

#s97
We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system

#s101
Probably so

#s102
on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are

#s104
so

#s107
As a freshman

#s109
Yep

#s112
Yeah

#s113
My daughter seems to be having a good time

#s114
she was absent with strep throat the last three days

#s115
and I ran over and picked up her report card

#s116
and she did very good

#s117
so and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect for a freshman to have

#s120
She 's not bogged down

#s121
but yet she has some every night

#s127
Yes

#s128
you always hear how good

#s129
Now my son 's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful

#s130
but who knows what he 's going to bring home
