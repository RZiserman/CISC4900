#s1
Okay

#s2
you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team or who you think will be doing well this year

#s7
Are we talking about is this the N B A

#s10
This is college College

#s11
okay

#s14
Uh-huh

#s17
And see that 's probably all all I saw

#s18
I we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas

#s19
and there 's so many colleges and universities in Texas

#s20
we have n't really followed them too much

#s21
and none of them are our our alma mater

#s22
so that seems to help

#s24
Uh I I follow it especially around the playoffs

#s25
so course I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz

#s26
and the Mailman or Karl Malone was you know pretty big thing

#s27
and the Lakers have always been amazing to watch

#s29
I I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks

#s30
They 've not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with with Tarpley

#s31
and maybe now that that 's over they 'll they 'll come out of it

#s32
but

#s34
Yeah

#s35
I hope they do something

#s36
They need to

#s37
or they 're not going to have any of the team left at all

#s39
Yeah

#s40
Kind of like the Cowboys I guess

#s43
Yeah

#s44
they coming out of it this year

#s45
We 'll see if it 's held on

#s47
The Bulls

#s50
Yeah

#s51
They 'll probably be pretty good

#s52
Course the Celtics are always really really good too with their players

#s54
Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all the the N B A players playing on the Olympic team

#s57
So

#s59
Yeah

#s60
I do n't know how close I 'll follow them though

#s61
And the season has n't started yet

#s62
I 'm usually more the end of the season person

#s63
and we need to talk about baseball

#s64
and so

#s67
Well

#s70
It 's

#s71
yeah

#s72
yeah

#s74
It is

#s75
it is

#s76
and that 's why I 've

#s77
I guess my mind went blank

#s78
It 's like last season was so long ago

#s79
and I have n't really even started thinking about basketball yet

#s80
so

#s82
But this was n't a good subject

#s83
but We 'll see how our predictions come true

#s86
Okay

#s87
it 's good talking to you

#s89
All righty

#s90
bye
