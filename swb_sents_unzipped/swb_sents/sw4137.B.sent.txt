#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Oh really

#s7
you like uh

#s8
so you 're an American

#s10
you want to buy American

#s15
Um

#s17
It terms of handling uh acceleration

#s29
What about Mustang G T -s

#s32
Those

#s33
so you 're talking about ones in a lower lower end p- price range

#s40
Right

#s41
Well you can wait till you graduate

#s42
and you 'll have plenty of money

#s43
you can buy whatever you want

#s53
Right

#s54
would you use that for city driving and racing

#s58
Autocrossing is

#s59
what kind of track is that

#s62
Okay

#s63
And you put up set up the track pylons

#s64
Okay

#s69
Oh really

#s71
Yeah

#s72
I would guess so

#s74
Uh I think I 'd like to get uh B M W or if I go the German route which I 'm kind of leaning towards right now but uh or maybe a Hon- I mean a a Acura Legend

#s75
Uh

#s78
a Lexus uh S C three hundred maybe Something on that order

#s80
I have n't really determined if I like the the Japanese or the if I like them enough to purchase one

#s81
You know because your B M W -s your German cars have good reputations I think

#s86
Yes

#s89
The

#s90
Yeah

#s91
they their they have the whole philosophy

#s92
I mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they 're better which is kind of hard to take

#s94
I mean as you 're walking through that little tour in uh Munich it 's kind of they 're trying to brainwash you too

#s104
Oh really

#s110
Um

#s113
Yeah

#s114
that 's

#s119
No

#s120
it 's not realistic

#s122
Yeah

#s123
if you can afford that kind of a toy then I guess uh

#s129
Yeah

#s130
just work short trips No m- no heavy mileage

#s131
I 'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year

#s133
So it 's pretty minimal

#s135
Lasts a long time

#s136
That 's mainly what I 'm looking for

#s140
Oh yeah

#s142
But But if if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop

#s143
they 're going to they 're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things

#s147
Uh I think well something on the order of a three series it 's probably different

#s148
Once you get up in the five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly

#s152
So I 'm kind

#s153
yeah

#s154
I 'm not sure if I really want
