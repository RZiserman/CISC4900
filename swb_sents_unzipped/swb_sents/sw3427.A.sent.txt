Well what kind of car uh are you thinking of buying next

#s3
You like the Chrysler products do you

#s9
Do you really

#s11
What year is it

#s13
And why do n't you like the Mustang

#s16
I 'll be darned

#s20
Well you know the old sayings about Fords what they stand for

#s21
There you go

#s22
Well uh

#s31
Well we 've always uh we 've always had Oldsmobiles and uh been very uh happy with Oldsmobiles

#s32
but uh my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang

#s33
and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those uh Mitsubishi Eclipses

#s34
She real- She likes uh likes those

#s36
She has a sister that lives in uh Phoenix that has one and uh really uh enjoys it

#s37
Well what uh what things do you consider when you buy a car

#s41
I see

#s44
Yeah

#s45
especially when you 're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time

#s48
That makes it very frustrating

#s55
Now this is a LeBaron

#s60
I sure like the uh convertible those rag top LeBarons

#s61
they really look sporty

#s66
Well uh we always

#s67
this last Oldsmobile we bought uh it 's an eighty-seven

#s68
but we bought it in eighty-eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them

#s70
and uh we found that uh we found a real good interest rate

#s71
you know when they 're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices

#s72
and uh uh you know we looked around at used cars

#s73
and we really could n't uh afford the payments on a used car

#s74
because uh if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent you know

#s75
and we ended up I think with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and the payments

#s87
Well that 's great

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Well when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door

#s94
Our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy-seven

#s95
It was a two door Cutlass Supreme

#s96
and uh it just happened that when we looked for our our new car they had a thing going with Oldsmobile

#s97
and if you 'd buy a a new Oldsmobile they 'd give you four hundred rebate because it was their seventy-fifth anniversary

#s99
I belie-

#s100
yeah

#s101
seventy-fifth anniversary

#s102
So in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them our uh papers on our first car

#s103
and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it

#s104
So we we got a four door this time

#s105
and I sort of went more for the uh the comfort factor

#s106
and uh I liked the smaller cars

#s107
but I 'm a bigger person

#s108
and I I really like comfort you know driving along the road and stuff

#s111
Yeah

#s114
And if you try to take anybody you know go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome
