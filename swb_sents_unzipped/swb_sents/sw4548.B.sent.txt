#s4
Oh really

#s6
You do n't believe in it

#s11
Yeah

#s15
You sound a lot like a friend of mine A a girl I hang out with

#s17
She has very very black and white opinions you know

#s18
There 's no gray in her opinions you know

#s19
She she probably would agree more with you

#s20
but but I do n't know

#s21
I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again

#s22
I 've never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family

#s24
but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they 've done

#s26
And we see that more and more

#s27
Like in our state right now there 's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl

#s29
you know that 's fourteen years old

#s30
What 's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult

#s33
Yeah

#s36
No

#s37
it does n't

#s38
but it costs less

#s41
And yeah

#s42
to me it is

#s43
I mean I work

#s44
and I pay my taxes

#s45
and I lived out in Texas for a little while

#s46
and they 're

#s47
and that 's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia

#s48
I mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in Georgia

#s50
But even in Georgia that 's the attitude for the most part

#s51
If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues

#s52
and we 'd get along just fine

#s55
But when I 've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I do n't like you very much anymore

#s65
Oh really

#s72
Yeah

#s75
You might be right

#s78
I mean I I 'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know

#s79
I would never in a million years want that job

#s81
but I do believe it 's necessary

#s82
and I

#s84
On the one hand I I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I could n't I could n't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing

#s86
and I could n't pull the switch

#s87
but uh

#s92
Yeah

#s94
Right

#s96
Uh-huh

#s99
What what 's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing

#s104
Yeah

#s108
Oh gosh

#s109
Oh yes

#s110
if it ever touched my fam-
