#s25
Yeah

#s26
so

#s29
Anyway so where 's your favorite place to go

#s32
Where in Arizona

#s34
Okay

#s35
I 've never been to Tempe

#s37
That 's where I 'd like to go

#s38
What do you like about Tempe

#s44
Pretty hot is n't it in the summer

#s49
That 's good

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Been to Hawaii

#s55
Yes

#s56
in fact I just got some reservations

#s57
I 'm going to go for uh almost two weeks this winter

#s59
Yes

#s60
It 's the longest

#s61
well actually I lived there

#s62
so I was there longer

#s63
but two weeks is the longest vacation I 'll have ever taken there

#s64
so I 'm kind of looking forward to that one

#s67
Uh no

#s68
in March

#s70
We 're going to go in March after my children 's birthdays and get all that business out of the way

#s72
Yeah

#s73
so I think I would like to go to Arizona

#s74
I mean I was in Phoenix in January last January

#s75
but it was rainy and icky

#s77
It was the coldest it 's been there ever in January I think

#s78
It 's very cold

#s80
But I would like to go to Tempe

#s82
Do we travel a lot

#s83
Uh some

#s84
yeah

#s85
Well I 've been a I was a travel agent

#s87
I mean I have been up until just a few months ago

#s88
But I 'm thinking of going back to work

#s90
Yeah

#s93
I lo- I know a lot of good places to go

#s94
But you definitely need to go to Hawaii

#s95
Very definitely

#s97
Yes

#s98
it is my favorite

#s99
My husband has n't been to Europe yet

#s100
and I 'd like to take him there

#s101
And but he 's traveled all over the United States

#s102
and I have n't

#s103
Like I have n't been down south

#s104
I 'd like to go to New Orleans

#s105
Have you been there

#s108
We I live in Yakima Washington

#s110
So it 's cold and rainy today

#s111
It 's yucky

#s113
But we 've had some pretty nice weather

#s114
We played tennis outdoors until last week

#s115
so that 's a pretty good deal

#s117
So do you go to school in Provo Utah

#s119
Do you use NuSkin skin care

#s120
They 're located in Provo

#s122
Do you

#s124
I 'm a NuSkin person

#s126
Yeah

#s127
I sell NuSkin too

#s128
I I am my only b-

#s130
and best cus-

#s131
not only and best

#s132
but I 'm my best customer

#s134
Since we 're not supposed to talk about this though is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream

#s136
Do you know

#s139
I have that too

#s140
I 'm forty-two

#s141
I need something

#s142
I need more

#s144
Yeah

#s145
I did n't know if there was anything else

#s146
And I use the Celltrex

#s148
But anyway

#s149
well yes

#s150
NuSkin is wonderful

#s153
I think it 's a wonderful product

#s154
Do you use it

#s159
Oh my gosh

#s160
That 's great

#s165
Yeah

#s166
oh yeah

#s168
That 's good

#s169
Are they good to work for

#s172
That 's great

#s174
Anyway so we 're supposed to be talking about places to go

#s175
and you have not been to Europe

#s176
Do you go to school

#s178
Do you ski

#s182
Ski

#s183
you probably ski very well in Utah

#s187
Uh

#s188
Why did you move to Utah

#s189
You 're going oh you are going to school At B Y U

#s192
is that where B Y U is

#s195
Okay

#s196
I know some people that went to B Y U

#s197
That 's great

#s198
Pretty good

#s200
Pretty pretty down there

#s201
Huh

#s204
So where have you skied

#s206
Sure

#s208
Sure

#s209
so you 're a sophomore Or junior

#s212
You 're a junior

#s213
Good for you

#s215
What are you studying

#s217
Good for you

#s218
You sound like a girl that has it together

#s219
I would just encourage you to do a little traveling though before you get married

#s220
Because when you get married you wo n't have the money or the time

#s223
So just you know

#s224
do n't do n't be in any hurry

#s227
You really should go to Europe

#s228
I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college

#s229
and that was just

#s230
I I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car

#s231
and I took the trip

#s232
And

#s234
uh I traveled with a group of sixteen other students

#s235
Actually they there was two other graduating seniors besides myself

#s236
and we just had a ball

#s237
We stayed at

#s239
Uh six weeks

#s241
Yeah

#s242
It was wonderful

#s243
so you should think about doing something like that
