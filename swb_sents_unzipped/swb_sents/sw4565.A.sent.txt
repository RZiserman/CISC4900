I you know

#s2
actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many convenience appliances and whatnot

#s3
We do n't even have to cook dinner anymore

#s7
Uh but I uh I 've heard I do n't know this for a fact but I 've heard that a lot of families really do n't spend a great deal of time together

#s8
That ki- the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents

#s11
It seems bizarre to me

#s12
I do n't quite understand it although I think probably the the worst thing that 's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television

#s14
Not so much because uh it 's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming

#s15
and I thin- there 's also some uh I think uh poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time

#s17
It 's so darned easy to turn the thing on

#s20
So I refuse to have one in the house

#s22
Yeah

#s28


#
Well I 'll tell you

#s32
Television sure makes child rearing easy on you

#s33
I mean the kids can be a real pest uh

#s34
and turning the T V on is almost like magic you know

#s35
it 's like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center

#s36
and you do n't have to worry about them

#s39
But I do n't think it 's too good

#s41
Uh so you know I do n't know

#s42
I take advantage

#s43
I do n't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids

#s44
but I take advantage of um dinner time

#s45
We always eat together

#s46
and you know whenever you 're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them

#s49
Uh I guess our big outlet is music

#s50
Uh

#s52
our thirteen year old son plays violin

#s53
and our nine year old daughter plays cello

#s55
and uh when our son started playing violin I took up violin

#s56
and when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello

#s57
So there 's plenty of plenty of interactive time in uh practicing Although neither kid likes to practice

#s58
I guess that 's not a big surprise

#s61
But I mea- I imagine with infants you are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them Although

#s66
Oh you know reading is so good

#s67
I uh I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little

#s68
and I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore

#s71
Uh but I read you know

#s72
there 's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book

#s73
Have you ever seen that yet

#s76
Yeah

#s77
it 's called a sleep book

#s78
and uh you ought to get it

#s79
I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized

#s80
Uh

#s82
Yeah

#s83
Well I think I think his sleep book is my favorite

#s94
Uh-huh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s98
So how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day

#s105
Oh I see

#s106
Ho- how old are your kids again

#s107
They 're two and one

#s109
Uh-huh

#s110
Yeah

#s111
so you have your hands full with them

#s112
that 's for sure
