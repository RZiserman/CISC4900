Okay

#s2
Martin do you do any exercise

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
Um so those are more or less indoor sports

#s9
How 's the weather out there in Georgia

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Oh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
Well yeah

#s21
I 'm on a exercise program

#s22
I 'm riding my Aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning

#s24
and I 'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning

#s25
and I feel like that 's been a real nice exercise in the winter time

#s26
It 's it 's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise

#s30
No

#s31
huh-uh

#s32
I first of all I 'd like to get my weight off

#s33
I 'm about fifty pounds overweight

#s34
and so I 'd like to get the weight off

#s35
and then I 'd really like to get into that

#s37
And uh we have a my husband and I have a a aerobic video that 's called The Firm

#s38
I do n't know if you 've heard of it

#s39
but it 's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down

#s40
but you 're using weights

#s41
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done

#s42
It 's it 's really fun

#s46
Yes

#s47
uh-huh

#s49
Uh-huh

#s50
Yes

#s53
Um no

#s54
I mean yes

#s55
I am

#s56
but I have never done it myself

#s57
Have you done that

#s62
Oh

#s64
That 's the big thing huh

#s67
Oh

#s68
So how is that

#s71
Oh

#s76
Oh

#s77
Uh-huh

#s78
Yeah

#s81
Now if um playing basketball

#s82
are you knees

#s83
do you have healthy knees

#s86
Oh dear

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Oh that 's good

#s92
Well that sounds you sound just like my husband

#s93
He he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball

#s95
and oh he 's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy

#s98
So that 's what he does

#s99
he wears his his brace and his high tops

#s100
and

#s104
Oh

#s105
Oh MUMBLEx

#s108
Wow

#s109
Uh-huh

#s110
Oh dear

#s111
Oh

#s113
It is amazing how fast you take off the inches

#s115
and I would once I start my forty- I 'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week

#s116
and then every other day I 'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day

#s118
But it is really amazing how fast the inches come off

#s119
and the muscle builds real fast

#s121
Um you can start

#s122
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month

#s123
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty-five pound dumbbells

#s125
and then you 're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video

#s126
and it 's a hour long video

#s127
so

#s129
It is

#s130
yeah

#s131
I really enjoy that

#s132
so I 'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy

#s136
Yes

#s137
Yes

#s138
Now this one has been quite mild

#s139
Um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground

#s140
It was quite chilly but not
