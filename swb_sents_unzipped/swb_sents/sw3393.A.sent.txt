Andrews

#s16
Well for the past week or two it 's been cold and wet

#s18
but before that for most of the year it 's been hot and dry

#s22
Um September really was

#s23
I 'm not sure about October

#s24
I think for about twelve months through September the the average temperature has been higher than normal each month

#s25
Um lots of ninety degree days during the summer

#s30


#


#
Uh-huh

#s46
Oh if you had it early

#s49
Yeah

#s50
I think we usually have a frost in October

#s52
Uh but you know We really need the rain that we 've been getting

#s53
and it has not today

#s54
but the last few days it 's been been pouring most of the day

#s56
Flooding anywhere

#s57
I have not heard of it any problems of it flooding anywhere

#s58
I mean that 's occurred certainly at times in the past

#s59
but uh no

#s60
I 've not heard of any particular problems this time

#s66
Yes

#s68
Yes

#s69
yeah

#s70
we had MUMBLEx summer lasting long

#s71
and then it then it then it became winter

#s72
like uh today it 's today it 's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day

#s81
Yeah

#s87


#
I do n't know

#s94
Yeah

#s95
our leaves are are all on on the ground now

#s96
I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors

#s98
Oh yeah

#s99
yeah

#s102
Yeah

#s103
we we did for a time

#s106
Uh-huh

#s113
Uh-huh

#s115
Been that this year for the trees for the leaves

#s121
Um

#s123
Yeah

#s124
that 's because it it ca n't tolerate a freeze this early

#s125
Is that right

#s127
If it would came later it would be all right

#s138
Um
