Um tell me some about your camping experiences Carolyn

#s3
Okay

#s10
Wh- where do you go camping at around here

#s13
Okay

#s16
Sure

#s18
Uh what uh what activities do you do when you 're camping

#s22
Uh-huh

#s23
Well that sounds like fun

#s24
I uh I grew up in South Dakota up in the Black Hills

#s26
and so we used to go camping

#s27
my dad would take us

#s28
there was there was four of us kids

#s29
we 'd he 'd take us

#s30
and we 'd all go camping my dad and my mom and and the kids

#s31
and it was always fun uh

#s32
because what I always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot

#s33
and uh he 'd always tell us you know okay look for you know a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents

#s34
and it always had to be somewhere near a a river so we could go fishing

#s35
and hopefully we 'd catch our supper

#s36
but we never did

#s38
but it was it was always fun

#s39
We 'd always

#s40
Mom was always prepared

#s41
and she 'd bring along you know something because tradition had it we would never catch anything

#s42
so we always had something along to eat

#s43
but then we 'd roast roast marshmallows

#s44
and it it was always an enjoyable experience

#s45
Uh about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills

#s46
I crossed the state to to Aberdeen

#s47
and uh there 's no hills

#s48
it 's flat

#s49
and then I was in high school

#s50
and uh couple of friends couple of my high school friends and I we 'd go camping out by a river of course and and go fishing

#s51
but by then of course I was able to catch uh catch some things

#s52
but it it was always fun

#s53
It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river

#s55
you know in the hills we we would do like you di- you folks did you folks did would take the nature hikes and you know and look for animals

#s56
and we always you know

#s57
in the hills you can see quite a few different animals

#s58
but

#s60
Go ahead

#s62
Okay

#s67
Sure

#s68
Now is there anything uh are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area

#s72
Okay

#s77
Uh-huh

#s78
I

#s80
Right

#s81

#s88
Okay

#s90
Helps helps keep the the pests out I suppose

#s93
Well that sounds

#s94
I do n't know if I can rate camping

#s95
but you know it sure beats driving a thousand miles to to find a mountain I guess

#s99
No

#s100

#s103
Yeah

#s104
