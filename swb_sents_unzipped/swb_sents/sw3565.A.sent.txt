#s1
you 've done

#s3
Well how did it go

#s6
Gee like starting over I guess

#s7
Uh

#s10
Uh-huh

#s14
Boy that sounds like uh

#s15
course uh I do n't know

#s16
once you get it done then you probably wo n't have that problem again

#s19
Um you 've got an older house

#s21
They are built a little bit more sturdy than

#s23
Right

#s25
Oh is that right

#s27
Yes

#s28
MUMBLEx

#s31
And just start at square one

#s33
Uh

#s35
Well and then if you do it wrong

#s37
Everything went all right

#s41
That 's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens

#s44
Right

#s45
Yes

#s46
Right

#s49
All worked out all right huh

#s51
Well um well probably the last thing I did was uh paint and wallpaper kids room

#s53
and uh I learned to

#s54
I used the wrong kind of paint

#s55
This was n't must have not been a very good quality because it just has n't stood up very well

#s57
It was a latex paint paint

#s58
it was flat

#s60
and I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss

#s61
Uh but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that

#s65
Yeah

#s66
but I think maybe uh

#s67
I do n't know if it was just the

#s69
Well it it is a latex paint

#s70
but it just kind of is is

#s71
so you know so it 's supposed to wash

#s72
you 're supposed to be able to wash it

#s74
but it um just looks dingy

#s75
I do n't know how else to explain it

#s77
It 's pink

#s80
It 's kind of got uh oh just kind of a worn look to it

#s81
I do n't know even how to say

#s82
just did n't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked

#s83
but

#s85
we put two coats on it

#s86
and it 's a small room

#s87
but I think it only took one uh can

#s89
No

#s91
We did uh oh

#s92
you do mix the color as far as you start with uh white and then they add the color

#s95
You know what I 'm saying

#s96
but

#s99
Yes

#s100
Right

#s101
And then I wall papered a couple of walls

#s102
and uh

#s104
Well that was the first time I 've ever wallpapered

#s105
and uh

#s107
That 's an education in itself

#s109
But uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from

#s110
first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you 're trying to match a design

#s112
Yes

#s113
That 's what I needed

#s114
and I did n't think about that

#s115
I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got

#s117
And so a lot is wasted

#s119
So you know how

#s120
See I did n't even think to look for that

#s122
And then the

#s123
one of them was just a different color different color pink is what it ended up being

#s125
And MUMBLEx

#s127
No

#s128
I did n't

#s130
Is that how you 're supposed to do

#s131
I started at one edge and went over

#s132
then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window

#s135
but uh

#s138
And start right there

#s139
Do you seem to get it straighter

#s140
is that the advantage

#s141
or what 's the

#
