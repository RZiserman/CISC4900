#s1
Uh well I guess social change takes in a a big category

#s2
but uh I guess the the one aspect of it that I took in uh consideration is more economical

#s4
I I know that the amount of or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has has greatly changed

#s7
I know they they did a

#s8
it was on a talk show

#s9
they took uh the parents and then the uh the son

#s10
and they compared income at different points in time when the when the father was you know was a little bit younger and more in his heyday

#s12
and they and they compared to the son 's that he was making now

#s13
And even though the son was probably more successful you know higher up in the the management ladder uh his he was actually making less money when you co- when you go by costs of living

#s19
Yeah

#s20
I know just uh just with me ten years ago I was comparing the

#s21
I think I I was living better ten years ago than I am now even though I 'm making more money now

#s22
but my dollar went a lot farther

#s28
Yeah

#s31
Yeah

#s32
well I I know gas prices have definitely jumped uh from uh

#s33
I know I used to pay twenty-five cents a gallon

#s34
and now it 's over a buck

#s36
I do n't know what it 's uh by you

#s37
Around here Minnesota Wisconsin area it 's uh it 's dropping

#s38
but I think it 's about a dollar fifteen on an average

#s42
Okay

#s43
Well that 's uh that 's unu-

#s44
most of the people I talk to are Texas

#s45
so

#s48
Yeah

#s51
Oh

#s52
I suppose this will be one of my towards my last one pretty soon

#s53
so they 'll stop me

#s55
but uh I 'm uh I 'm pretty much out to the things to say

#s57
Yeah

#s60
Okay

#s61
yeah

#s62
I I I do n't think they they consider

#s63
like I say it 's a broad category

#s64
it 's just I 'm not economical

#s65
but uh even attitudes on on clothing and stuff uh I know

#s70
Yeah

#s71
I I I know a lot of the things that that we wear men wear nowadays were would have been considered uh feminine uh many years ago

#s72
but I know it 's been it was hard for me at first

#s75
but now I kind of like you know a lot of the bright colors

#s77
I mean like I used to be more uh conservative and just your basic colors

#s78
but now I I do like some of these uh brighter fluorescent colors

#s84
Yeah

#s86
Yeah

#s87
I I I guess the the best thing I like to see from the sixties and seventies is of course is the mini skirt of course

#s88
One of the nice things

#s89
but uh

#s90
yeah

#s91
I do n't think that there 's anything as original

#s92
it 's it 's all based on uh one of the past styles

#s93
they just um make their uh circle and come back again

#s95
So if you hang onto your clothes long enough uh they 'll they 'll be back in style in a few years

#s101
Yeah

#s104
Well I think thinking back I think the only style I hope does n't come back is bell bottoms

#s108
I guess when I look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms I say God
