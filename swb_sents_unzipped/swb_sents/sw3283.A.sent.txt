Okay

#s2
We 're talking about capital punishment

#s4
How do you feel about that Lenore

#s6
Well wonderful

#s7
I am too one hundred percent

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
All your life

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
There 's no deterrent

#s15
That 's right

#s16
There 's just no deterrent

#s18
And so many of those kind of people they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway

#s19
so you know unless they really make it rough on them that 's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent I do n't think

#s21
Right

#s22
Well I do n't know what Oklahoma 's laws are

#s23
but Texas 's I do n't know are

#s24
I do n't know

#s25
it 's it 's no one 's f-

#s26
I mean it 's not the judge 's fault I do n't think

#s27
It 's just the way the law is down here

#s28
Man our cr- our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two

#s32
Well that 's what ours did

#s33
same thing

#s35
Uh-huh

#s36
uh-huh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s42
Huh-uh

#s44
It 's not here either really

#s48
I do too

#s49
and and you know but the way the courts are set up they 've they 've got so many chances for appeal

#s50
but I think th- I think it needs to be expedited

#s51
You know if they 've been convicted and given an appeal and they 're still convicted of of a crime that 's deserving of of a lethal injection let 's do it and not waste so many years to do it

#s54
That 's right

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s59
Yeah

#s60
That 's right

#s61
Somehow it just does n't

#s62
it works

#s63
and then again it takes too long for it to work

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
yeah

#s73
Yeah

#s74
it equ-

#s76
I do too

#s77
I think that needs to

#s78
and I do n't see why it could n't be shortened considerably

#s79
But you know

#s81
Yea-

#s82
that 's true

#s83
It is overcrowded because there 's so much drug uh problem with the people on drugs

#s84
because that ha-

#s85
they with the drugs they 're they 're robbing and killing

#s86
and uh that 's why it 's filled the prisons up so much I think

#s88
No

#s89
it does n't

#s93
Yeah

#s94
that 's true

#s95
With all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things

#s96
but

#s98
Boy have n't that we though

#s99
We really have

#s100
But anyway I 'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment

#s102
I 'm I 'm very muchly for it

#s103
Always have been

#s104
always will be

#s110
It could be supportive

#s111
It it 's it 's supported with facts though

#s114
It could very easily be supported with facts
