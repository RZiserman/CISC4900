#s5
Uh-huh

#s6
That sounds about right

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
Right

#s12
Uh

#s13
Well it 's kind of difficult for me Because right now uh like most teachers I 'm laid off

#s14
and

#s17
so um I spend most you know

#s18
I substitute a lot

#s20
So it 's a lot it 's very hard on a nonfixed income because I do n't know how many days I 'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances

#s22
And but I know how much I have to bring in a month

#s23
And that 's about it

#s24
That 's about as far as we go

#s25
And then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us And just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day

#s30
Uh no

#s31
I 'm a single mother

#s32
I have three children

#s35
So uh right now we 're on we get f- you know aid from the state at this point because there 's no other way to do it

#s36
And my ex-husband just sort of took off and does n't pay child support

#s38
So right now I know what I 'm getting from the state

#s39
and uh I have to balance more or less what I get from the state with my bills and uh you know try to work as many days as possible Any time they call me in

#s41
But I still have to figure out

#s42
If I work too many days then I lose all my state aid

#s43
and if I do n't work enough days then I do n't get enough to meet the bills

#s44
and it 's like a juggling act every single month

#s46
Like this week I 've been just holding my breath and hoping they 'll call me in

#s47
but they probably wo n't because next week the kids have school vacation

#s49
So you know the four days before they only have a four day week

#s51
and they usually do n't need subs because everybody 's pretty good about coming in

#s53
They do n't like to be absent before a vacation

#s55
But we 're shopping around as far as well I 'm shopping around as far as trying to get uh that 's why I 'm doing this to get some extra money And uh getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts

#s57
My kids are in Boy Scouts

#s58
so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts

#s59
because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me

#s60
So it 's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit

#s61
But you know we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul

#s62
I guess we 're in the situation that a lot of am- middle-class Americans are in

#s67
Oh my Lord

#s72
Really

#s75
Uh-huh

#s77
Oh

#s80
Sure

#s85
Right

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
Definitely

#s90
Uh yes

#s91
we do

#s92
And we try to

#s94
you know I keep track of every penny And more or less enter it in

#s96
Every single day I 'm at the computer

#s98
And it 's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month What has n't come in yet you know
