Uh do you have children in school

#s4
Uh I have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college

#s6
but I also have two that are just entering school

#s7
Uh Uh well I think they 're just pushing them mu- entirely to fast

#s11
Uh well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade

#s13
My son leaves the house at seven thirty and does n't get home until three o'clock

#s15
And I think that 's such a long day for a kindergartner

#s18
And uh I have a preschooler

#s19
Uh I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten

#s20
and I thought well how mature do you have to be

#s23
And uh there is a

#s24
do you have the standardized testing now

#s28
Yeah

#s33
No

#s36
Uh-huh

#s39
Oh

#s41
Yeah

#s44
Yeah

#s51
you would like to know what they 're doing right

#s58
Oh me

#s59
Well that makes it hard for you does n't it

#s63
Oh me

#s66
Yeah

#s68
It 's hard to explain to them why you ca n't

#s71
Right

#s74
Oh dear

#s77
Right

#s81
Right

#s84
How about the kids

#s85
How are they coping with it

#s88
Huh Right

#s93
Yeah

#s94
Rather than anticipating

#s106
Oh it is

#s108
That 's right

#s109
My son said that came home

#s110
and he said he said Mom all we do is work

#s113
We hardly ever play

#s114
and

#s117
Oh likewise

#s119
Right

#s121
Would n't that be great

#s122
Uh-huh

#s123
Right

#s130
Is that right

#s132
Oh my gosh

#s133
Oh my gosh

#s135
Well for example in my son 's kindergarten They 're really finished at lunch time

#s136
After lunch they have some uh

#s137
I 'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch

#s138
and then they have naps or rest period

#s140
And uh I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting

#s142
I agree

#s144
I would n't be surprised

#s146
I doubt if they would say it was too long

#s148
Uh do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care
