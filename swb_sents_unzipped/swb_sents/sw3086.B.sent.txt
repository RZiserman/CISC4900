I have a personal computer at home

#s3
It 's an A T compatible

#s4
I do n't use it very much any more

#s5
I used to use it quite a bit

#s7
I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal

#s8
I do some P C stand alone work on it

#s9
and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame

#s11
What about you

#s12
Do you own a computer

#s16
Are you leasing them

#s20
Loaners from work

#s23
Do you work for T I

#s30
What brand are they

#s32
Uh-huh

#s34
I 'm jealous

#s45
What kind of consulting do you do

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
What kind of work do you do when you 're consulting

#s53
Is it programming related

#s60
Uh-huh

#s64
Word processing

#s67
No

#s68
I 'm not familiar with that

#s72
Uh-huh

#s78
So you 've got you 've got a modem in it then

#s81
At home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them

#s84
Uh and so it 's an external modem

#s87
I got when I got mine I had an internal modem in it

#s89
I used it uh quite a bit when I was uh uh looking at uh information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a in Fort Worth

#s91
but uh went out of town for a while

#s92
and and sort of got off the uh bulletin board and off of my micro completely

#s94
and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without uh even without using it on the computer

#s95
I could turn a computer on

#s96
it 'd start squawking

#s97
So I finally opened up the box and took it out

#s99
I think that 's the thirty second warning

#s102
Yes

#s104
Okay

#s105
Where Where are you

#s107
and uh

#s109
Are you at home now

#s112
So you 've got a lot of traffic noise real close

#s119
What time is it now where you are

#s121
So you 're an hour ahead of where I am

#s122
I 'm in Central Central time zone

#s127
No

#s128
I have n't done that

#s129
Uh I know someone who has

#s130
and and she 's uh very uh pleased with it

#s131
She told me some of the things you can do

#s132
and it 's just a a very handy tool to have

#s134
Yeah

#s135
and you can do a l-

#s136
it makes things very convenient

#s137
You can save a lot of money too Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if that 's what you have in mind

#s145
I have I have used Lotus

#s146
I have used uh Word Perfect

#s148
uh I

#s149
not heavy use

#s150
I 've used uh D Base

#s151
and uh I 've used a substantial amount of shareware

#s152
Um I have n't done much Lotus work connected with my job

#s153
I 've been through three classes

#s155
and I have a great deal of respect for it

#s157
Um I have n't done much word processing work with my job

#s158
I do some

#s160
and I

#s161
and the D Base work I 've done was strictly class related

#s164
Well it 's probably the granddaddy of most uh data base management systems

#s166
It 's got some pretty strong competitors

#s167
Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base

#s168
so I I think by now it 's a matter of uh personal taste

#s171
I can understand that very easily

#s172
I 've used I 've had a class on um R Base and also in Paradox

#s174
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base

#s178
Um I would n't say compatible

#s179
but certainly comparable

#s185
Uh-huh

#s187
I 'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames

#s190
I do uh main- mainly business data processing

#s192
I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility

#s194
Um sometimes I get called late at night at home because there 's a production problem

#s195
and that gives me the opportunity to uh come in to work and fix it if I ca n't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we 're on the phone

#s197
Um I also uh handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected
