Okay

#s3
I thought it was supposed to give a recording

#s4
but anyway uh well I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for for my wife and for me

#s5
and uh I embarrassed to say it 's pretty trivial

#s7
All we all I do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month

#s8
but I doubt I do it more than three times a year

#s11
And

#s12
No

#s13
I work with them all day

#s14
I 'm in computer science

#s15
yet I I do everything on paper

#s18
Uh I do n't even use a calculator for the stuff I 'm doing because it 's all pretty round numbers

#s24
Uh-huh

#s29
Yeah

#s30
that

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Yes

#s38
it 's pretty straightforward

#s39
It 's almo-

#s40
I ca n't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know fancy budgets

#s42
It seems like if you 're getting to that level y- you 're not in real good control

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Yeah

#s51
Actually I mean I like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it 's a record of everything

#s53
and I do n't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month

#s56
Uh

#s62
Yeah

#s63
I guess if that 's if that 's a weakness that 's a good thing to do

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70
Sure

#s74
Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that

#s75
or

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
Well that 's good to know

#s83
Yeah

#s85
I do n't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it

#s87
It seems like it 's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it

#s91
I

#s92
Yeah

#s93
just the form

#s94
Yeah

#s96
Yeah

#s97
and a lot of them

#s102
Yeah

#s104
I I do n't trust myself with using a calculator or computer y- too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that that I I keep on top of the numbers and understand what 's going on

#s107
I know too many people who use a calculator

#s108
if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they were n't paying attention

#s110
And it seem

#s117
Yeah

#s119
We have the same thing

#s121
Yeah

#s123
Sure
