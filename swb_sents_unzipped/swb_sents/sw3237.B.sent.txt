#s3
Uh-huh

#s5
It 's a two bedroom two baths duplex

#s7
Brick and uh

#s10
No

#s11
we own it

#s12
yeah

#s13

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
uh-huh

#s20
Uh-huh

#s21

#s23

#s24
huh-uh

#s25
Do you

#s29
Ours is too

#s30
We outgrew it when we moved in

#s33
Uh-huh

#s35
Uh-huh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
Um

#s44
Yeah

#s46
Oh wow

#s49
You all are cramped

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
Uh-huh

#s56
Oh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
how many bedrooms is it

#s60
Uh-huh

#s61
Uh-huh

#s63
Oh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s70
Yeah

#s72
Uh-huh

#s74
How fun

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
And how old 's the youngest

#s83
Uh-huh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s94
Yeah

#s95
Yeah

#s97
That 's what we 'd like to do

#s100
Oh it 's a wonderful place to live

#s101
and they

#s102
I do n't have any kids

#s103
so I do n't really know

#s104
but they say that we have wonderful schools

#s106
Uh-huh

#s108
Um

#s112
I do n't think so

#s113
no

#s116
Oh of course those are my kids

#s118
I have two dogs

#s122
Yeah

#s123
they 're inside dogs

#s125
They 're my babies

#s128
Uh um kind of a mauve and gray

#s130
Uh-huh

#s131
and then the kitchen 's kind of a a country pink and country blue

#s132
and it 's all done in cows

#s134
I 'm a cow nut

#s137
Uh-huh

#s139
so

#s142
Uh-huh

#s144
Wow

#s150
Yeah

#s152
Yeah

#s154
Uh-huh

#s155
Uh-huh

#s157
Oh yeah

#s158
yeah

#s161
Uh-huh

#s164
Oh sounds pretty

#s168
Oh

#s170
Uh-huh

#s171
uh-huh

#s174
Good

#s177
That 's an important factor there

#s181
Well you know now we have that new mall in Lewisville

#s183
and that 's just like a mile or two from our house

#s185
but when we first moved to Coppell it 's what six years ago we did n't even have a grocery store

#s187
and now we have four

#s189
and Coppell 's not really big enough to support fo- four grocery stores

#s192
so

#s194
Oh much very much

#s196
In fact it 's about the size now

#s197
I moved down here from Chicago what twenty-three years ago and to Lewisville

#s200
and Coppell 's now about the size that Lewisville was when when I moved down here

#s203
Uh-huh

#s206
Oh really
