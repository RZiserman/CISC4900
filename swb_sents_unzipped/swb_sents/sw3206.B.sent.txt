#s3
Yes

#s6
Uh yes

#s7
It 's about why there are n't more people that are voting and participating in

#s10
Oh absolutely

#s13
Um I think that uh it 's kind of discouraging to uh

#s14
I have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing

#s15
and it 's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not

#s16
a lot of them are so ill informed

#s17
they have no idea you know even that there 's an election

#s18
or and these are people that are registered

#s25
Well that 's a thought

#s27
Huh

#s28
I do n't know

#s29
I I like that idea

#s30
Um oh I had a thought just a second ago

#s31
but it slipped my mind

#s33
Um one thing that I- that I think probably one of the reasons that people do n't vote more is because they do n't know the candidates

#s34
And I think sometimes you know

#s35
that 's one thing that I have learned in w- working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you do n't really know what they 're like

#s36
I know there 's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for

#s37
and when they got in office it was just a disaster

#s39
Uh and and I 'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them

#s42
Absolutely

#s48
That 's right

#s53
Now if you just lose if you just skip one election

#s56
Three

#s58
Uh-huh

#s61
I think that 's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it

#s64
No excuse

#s65
Uh I 'm not sure if I 'm familiar with that or not

#s68
Uh-huh

#s72
Oh I think that 's great

#s73
Um

#s75
Actually you know my husband has run for office before

#s76
and sometimes it 's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because you know if you 're going to be tied up that day uh campaigning or whatever it might be Um that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know

#s77
you can just go ahead and get that taken care of

#s78
and

#s80
Uh-huh

#s85
Uh-huh

#s91
Well hopefully once they have uh you know once they 've checked them off the list they they do have to check them off a list when they vote

#s94
so hopefully they could n't
