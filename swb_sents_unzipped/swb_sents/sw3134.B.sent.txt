#s4
No

#s5
As many years as we 've been involved in one

#s6
I really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems they 're not a lot of problems where I teach

#s8
But from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems uh with dropouts

#s9
Uh when I was in Minnesota last summer there was a teacher who said that uh on a given day she did n't know how many of her students would show up

#s11
and sometimes they did n't even show up for class

#s12
and she taught in high school in inner city uh Minneapolis

#s14
And uh they just did n't come to school

#s16
And I can not imagine being able to do much of anything when they do n't even come to school

#s19
Uh-huh

#s25
I think so too

#s29
The home is the key

#s31
I think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education

#s33
and uh the- the main goal is making money now

#s34
and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand

#s37
So uh

#s39
Right

#s42
Your education

#s45
That 's right

#s46
It 's what 's wrong with families

#s47
and if if children come to school yes insecure and their mo- biggest concern is survival both at home

#s50
they do n't know what to expect at home

#s51
They do n't feel secure there

#s52
they do n't know what 's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex

#s54
For example that child that was shot

#s56
Uh how can they concentrate on schooling

#s57
I agree with you

#s59
I think that 's the main problem

#s61
And schools now are supposed to solve social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security

#s64
And that 's overwhelming

#s68
No

#s69
It is n't

#s73
True

#s74
I think they there has to be at least a counselor

#s75
and we just recently had a counselor at elementary

#s76
We did n't even have counselors in elementary

#s78
We have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids

#s79
and they divided them up between three counselors

#s80
but for a good while every year they 'd have a different counselor

#s81
and they decided that did n't work

#s83
So they started uh dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees through you know through all three years of middle school

#s87
And I think that would give them more security in going to the counselor

#s89
If they have a rapport with their counselor

#s90
Now if they do n't I hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them

#s93
And occasionally that happens

#s95
But it is frightening

#s96
b- Because uh education is the key to our future

#s99
and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another then what are we going to do with them

#s102
What 's going to happen to them

#s103
Are they going to be able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs

#s104
or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison

#s106
And our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them

#s108
That 's no good

#s110
Uh-huh

#s115
Uh-huh

#s118
Uh-huh

#s122
Well I think uh one thing that we 'll see is that we wo n't be educating everybody

#s124
There will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they do n't try to educate everyone

#s127
That 's one of the things that we do

#s128
We try to educate everyone

#s131
We 're the only country in the world that does

#s134
And let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they 're willing you know to work and have uh some ability

#s137
They can do that

#s140
Uh-huh

#s143
Well you know if we can keep them in school

#s145
Uh-huh

#s147
then that that helps a lot

#s148
I think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too

#s151
It 's scary to me

#s154
I We are

#s161
Uh I would imagine that we 've talked the amount of time necessary

#s163
Okay

#s165
Alright

#s166
We were in uh Austin yesterday

#s168
The reason that I was n't at church

#s169
and we went to hear uh James wind ensemble concert

#s170
Oh

#s171
they left this morning for uh England

#s175
Uh-huh

#s177
And uh the university
