The AIDS issue is is a bit of a problem

#s2
I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end

#s3
And how can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem uh

#s4
but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor I 'm not really sure if it 's true or not that uh we 're not spending as much per let 's say afflicted person on cancer

#s5
Uh there 's some uh

#s6
take breast cancer for instance

#s7
It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more pe- many more people than AIDS

#s8
And yet uh more people die of it

#s9
and yet the funding has already uh exceeded

#s10
AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer

#s14
So uh

#s15
I mean if it 's true

#s16
I I 've I 've always heard these things

#s17
I 've never bothered to dig it out and make sure

#s18
but uh I 've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that whoever 's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and uh

#s19
it 's just one big P R campaign that

#s20
yeah

#s21
we think that 's the world 's worst thing

#s22
so let 's give money to AIDS

#s23
And yet we 've had breast cancer problems for years

#s25
And it 's just

#s26
one of those uh course one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that since it does n't effect men it 's not going to get funded

#s27
And uh having thought about that for a while

#s29
Well I I kind of I thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing

#s30
But then I got I got to thinking the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate

#s31
and there 's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood in- antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood

#s32
and that 's fairly recent

#s33
And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years

#s36
So it 's not really cured

#s37
yeah

#s38
it 's not uh not that heavily funded either

#s39
and then that seems to be one of the the major uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer

#s40
so I do n't know

#s41
I I guess there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to Uh be it through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever uh illness they wish

#s43
It 's kind of hard to to get an even keel on that

#s44
I mean it 's really hard to say

#s45
well there 's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one

#s46
so let 's give it this amount

#s47
and then this other one 's only a tenth of that

#s48
so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way

#s49
or

#s54
Right

#s59
Right

#s61
That 's true

#s63
You know the the other thought that I had uh

#s64
I 've had several minutes to think about this after I uh

#s65
while I was finding people I uh I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it

#s66
so it 's kind of a a unfair advantage as it were

#s67
but the other thing that I thought of on this is I wonder if there is n't enough money uh in our economy or in our system

#s68
Uh it seems like there 's so much that goes to things that do n't really do a whole lot of good

#s69
I mean yeah

#s70
they 're kind of nice

#s71
But we have such an affluent a- society society that I wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a a cure for just about everything

#s73
Of course then we would n't have any room to put people

#s74
but that 's

#s77
Yeah

#s78
You know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza

#s79
or you hear these these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this that or the other

#s80
and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic

#s81
but are they that enhancing for the for the masses you know

#s83
They certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that

#s84
but uh had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
