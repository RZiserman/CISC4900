#s1
Okay

#s5
I see

#s6
A a good a good southern solution

#s11
Uh-huh

#s12
You 'd have to say that

#s13
Uh I do n't know

#s14
The the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing

#s16
And seems to me that that 's I think that 's the way it 's done now

#s17
Uh at least my understanding of the law which is n't very good

#s19
Uh it seems to me that the judge does it

#s20
and I I think that 's probably all right in that they you know maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing

#s23
Right

#s26
Uh-huh

#s30
That 's right

#s32
And I think that may I that may be an exception as well

#s33
Because I think that

#s34
does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge

#s36
Yeah

#s39
Yes

#s40
In fact they 're going to execute somebody at the end of this month

#s43
And uh there 's a big uproar going on right now

#s44
Uh

#s46
the uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether he 's going to commute it or not

#s48
You know it 's someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact

#s53
Yeah

#s56
Uh-huh

#s60
Something inexpensive

#s69
Yeah

#s70
I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years

#s74
But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake

#s75
and you 'd hate to be one of those

#s79
The other thing they asked about was whether uh uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous Which again I think is the way it is now That all the all verdicts

#s81
well maybe not

#s82
I do n't know

#s83
At least in capital cases I 'd think they 'd have to be unanimous

#s86
Uh-huh

#s90
Yeah

#s91
The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial And that there 's one juror that is is uh different than the other eleven

#s94
And uh they 've only deliberated four hours or something

#s95
and they say they 're hopelessly deadlocked

#s97
And the judge told them they were n't hopelessly deadlocked yet

#s101
Yeah

#s102
Six months so far they said

#s105
So

#s110
Maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote

#s114
Right

#s117
Oh really

#s121
That 's interesting

#s125
Well have you ever served on a jury

#s131
Uh-huh

#s132
I got called

#s133
but I uh never uh got selected for a jury

#s135
I sat for tw- ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process

#s137
and they had some guy that was uh defending himself
