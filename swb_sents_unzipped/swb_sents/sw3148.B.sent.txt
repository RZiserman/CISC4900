#s1
Okay

#s2
Um

#s4
In Plano

#s6
Yes

#s7
Where do you live

#s9
Oh okay

#s13
Huh

#s14
Um I was trying to think uh

#s15
something we were watching the other day

#s16
and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles uh from an area that was up higher

#s17
and you literally could see the band of smog

#s18
That uh

#s19
I 've never been out there

#s20
but it was it was quite evident that it was a real brown area

#s23
and

#s26
Yeah

#s28
Yes

#s29
Yeah

#s32
Yes

#s33
Well I know uh that 's been the concern in Europe

#s34
They had n't

#s35
uh we have friends in Germany and uh have family that live near the Black Forest area

#s36
and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we s- uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars uh

#s37
that 's something that Europe did n't do right away

#s38
and now they 're doing that

#s39
and I guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country that 's the only pollution that 's been there

#s40
It 's not an area that is industry

#s41
but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of

#s43
Um I guess

#s44
From from something that the car was uh was giving

#s46
Yes

#s47
and

#s51
Yes

#s52
Yeah

#s67
Yes

#s76
Yes

#s78
Yeah

#s79
I I get that sometimes um

#s80
my line gets some static

#s81
I do n't know why

#s84
Well I know it 's MUMBLEx um

#s85
we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston

#s86
and uh oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal

#s88
Oh I do n't know what to

#s89
usually it 's the other phone I have trouble with

#s90
It must just be on the line

#s91
Can you hear me

#s93
Okay

#s94
I do n't know what uh I I do n't know what the problem is

#s95
but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater

#s96
and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy

#s99
and we have enough clouds that uh

#s100
there are other areas that would be better suited

#s101
That surprised me because I think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days

#s102
And and it

#s103
yes

#s104
it can be used

#s105
and it can help

#s106
but uh that was a problem that they were still working on

#s107
But

#s110
Well I

#s112
Yes

#s118
Yes

#s128
Uh I hope so

#s132
Well I do think um

#s133
I mean you 've already mentioned several things I think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in uh

#s135
Yes

#s137
Yes

#s138
Well and and for the future generations too

#s139
Uh

#s142
Yes
