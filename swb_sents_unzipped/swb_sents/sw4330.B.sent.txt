Actually uh they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting

#s3
because w- when I went to work for them uh they did n't do that

#s4
but uh since then they 've they 've started a drug testing policy not because of their own uh convictions but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that

#s6
How about you

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Um

#s15
Okay

#s19
Yeah

#s21
Uh-huh

#s28
Yeah

#s31
Well it 's actually uh

#s32
we do oil well services

#s33
So a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies

#s34
and they go out to

#s35
we have engineers who uh go out to the oil well to the to the client 's oil well and and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff

#s36
so the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they 're on their their you know territory and everything

#s37
but the thing that 's interesting is that I w- I 'm an engineer and a software engineer

#s39
and I work in the software uh house

#s40
and everybody there you know are all software engineers

#s41
They 've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything

#s42
and yet we 're getting we 're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh th- all the engineers have to to

#s43
well a little different actually

#s44
but uh you know we have to go through the same thing

#s45
and it 's but it 's uh it 's a little different I guess than than a lot of drug policies

#s46
In our case it 's like when you hire on they 'll test you

#s47
and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away

#s49
Other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that

#s50
but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first

#s51
Particularly like uh we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol

#s52
and tha- they did n't find any problem with that you know

#s53
but

#s55
Uh

#s63
Yeah

#s70
Yeah

#s72
Yeah

#s73
it 's really it 's really bizarre

#s74
Uh particularly like where we are you know

#s75
I I

#s76
there was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle

#s77
and she she was a personnel secretary

#s78
and she had to get tested

#s79
and I do n't know

#s80
I 'm ambivalent about the whole thing

#s81
I you know I have a lot of mixed feelings about

#s82
on the one hand it 's like if you know

#s83
they 're they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense

#s84
and you know it 's like you 're I mean employments are contractual by nature anyway

#s86
but uh I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that where I had to uh uh do a drug test

#s87
and and it 's it was kind of a long story

#s88
but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through

#s89
and it amounted to uh going in uh before any of these interviews

#s90
I 'm not even working for this company

#s91
I 'm going in for like interviews

#s92
and they flew me out to Chicago

#s93
and and uh before I went into any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical

#s94
They said it was going to be a physical you know

#s95
and uh actually bec- beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening

#s96
but I had forgotten about that

#s97
and so basically I 'd already peed off in that morning

#s98
and and when I got in there I did n't I was n't like able to give a full sample

#s99
and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again

#s102
and the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating

#s103
You go in there with the doctor

#s104
he makes you take off all your clothes

#s105
and then he examines you
