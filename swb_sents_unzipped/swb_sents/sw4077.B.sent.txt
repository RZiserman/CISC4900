#s2
Well uh I mean I do n't think that guns should be outlawed

#s4
but it 's going to

#s5
a lot of the stuff that

#s6
I mean all you do is to get guns

#s7
and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago

#s8
But I do n't really know I mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh prevent that

#s13
Yeah

#s14
that

#s15
well do you even know what the procedures are now

#s16
Um

#s18
But it 's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it

#s20
Yeah

#s23
Huh I did n't know that

#s24
Well that 's pretty scary

#s25
So does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten

#s28
That 's where I would probably be

#s30
Well I mean I mean I do n't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better

#s32
because I mean I do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff

#s34
and I can understand them wanting to have them

#s35
but then again it 's just like all those nuts out there

#s38
It has

#s39
Because

#s43
Um

#s45
Yeah

#s47
Well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta

#s51
Yeah

#s52
I know Dallas is

#s55
I do n't know if Dallas is in the top three

#s57
but Do you own a gun

#s64
Uh-huh

#s66
Yeah

#s69
That 's true

#s78
Yeah

#s79
Well Well now when I first moved to Dallas I moved up here by myself

#s84
and uh my Dad gave me a gun

#s86
but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it

#s88
so I finally ended up giving it back to him

#s89
I said I do n't want it

#s90
I do n't want to be responsible for it because you know if you 're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn I do n't need it

#s98


#
And they get it from you

#s101
Uh-huh

#s102
Set them off

#s105
Yeah

#s106
well that 's why I ended up giving it back to him

#s107
I thought well you know I do n't want it if I do n't know how to oper- you know if I do n't really know how to use it

#s110
and I just did n't want the responsibility

#s112
So Well uh did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever

#s115
Yeah

#s116
right

#s117
That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns

#s119
I would be scared selling guns to people
