#s2
How about you

#s3
What do you do with your budget

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
Yeah

#s11
That 's true

#s18
Yeah

#s19
that 's sort of a problem

#s22
We 're trying we 're trying to uh

#s23
so far we are in the clear credit wise

#s24
but uh the other side of it is

#s25
so not much on that side of it to add to it

#s26
We 're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that

#s27
but

#s29
Yeah

#s30
we 'd like to do that some day

#s31
We have this dream

#s33
But we do n't know how long it will be a dream

#s34
We we 're kind of real we 're real happy that we do n't have any debt

#s35
but we 're at the same time we 're real scared about incurring it in this uh economy right now

#s36
so we 're stepping real careful and trying to see what 's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month

#s39
We 're missionaries actually

#s41
Yeah

#s42
uh-huh

#s43
And uh it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota

#s45
and it 's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here

#s47
And it does n't get switched very easily once you come home

#s49
So

#s51
Africa

#s52
Nigeria

#s54
Yeah

#s57
About four years

#s58
We 're career

#s59
so we we go over seas for four years

#s60
and then we come back for a year

#s61
We go over four

#s62
we come back for a year

#s64
Uh we 're with Wycliff Bible Translators

#s67
So

#s70
Yeah

#s71
they could very well

#s72
and

#s75
Uh we will be

#s76
I was over over four years doing language surveying which is the first step

#s77
You 're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need

#s79
And uh came home and got married

#s80
and we will go ba- back as translators cause we want to raise a family

#s81
and it is easier to raise a family as translators

#s82
Well I always wanted to do translation

#s83
but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it 's easier

#s84
You know they really need surveyors cause you could you 're free to travel anywhere

#s85
You do n't have kids hanging around you and stuff

#s89
Well I have a smattering of about ten different ones

#s90
but there 's

#s91
I 'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other you know

#s92
since I did you know complete a survey in one area I 'd switch to the other

#s93
Uh-huh

#s94
So I know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff

#s95
but in about uh about five I guess I can do better in it

#s96
And my French is pretty good

#s97
but it 's uh MUMBLEx French

#s98
so uh I 'm terrified to speak in uh in France

#s99
In France

#s100
Yeah

#s101
because they 're real snobby about their language

#s102
and MUMBLEx French is street French

#s103
and I just picked it up off the street

#s104
and I knew what I was I knew what I was communicating

#s105
but I did n't know what I was saying

#s106
I never sat there and got a direct translation

#s107
and said something here when I came home and French to somebody

#s108
and he paled and said uh I 'm not going to tell you what you said

#s109
So since then I have refrained from speaking any French

#s110
So

#s112
Uh

#s113
I do n't know what I said to him

#s114
but uh I did n't ask him either
