#s3
Well that 's that 's a really hard question

#s4
I do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths

#s5
Uh I

#s6
let 's example uh

#s7
our friend the President right now says no new taxes

#s8
we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession

#s9
and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases

#s10
so uh I know the politicians uh are n't are n't straightforward

#s11
Now i- in terms of economics I 'm not

#s12
it 's hard hard to call

#s13
It really is

#s21
Right

#s26
Yes uh

#s33
Well yeah

#s34
I 'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular

#s35
I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio

#s37
I 'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio

#s42
Right

#s44
Yeah

#s45
it 's it 's it 's funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh c- congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals

#s47
and the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing

#s49
Oh

#s50
I I think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste

#s51
On the other hand uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things Uh and just to get rid of the unimportant things

#s53
And whenever there 's that kind of subjective judgment there 's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exa- where the boundary between waste and and necessity is

#s55
So I 'm not I 'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems

#s56
but there definitely is is a problem with

#s57
uh I forgot

#s58
there 's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something

#s60
Uh

#s62
Pork barrel politics

#s63
The- the- there has to be some way to do it

#s64
I know state governors usually have line item vetos

#s65
and uh I lived in Massachusetts for a while

#s66
and uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and was n't necessarily so popular

#s69
D-

#s70
at least at the end

#s74
Yeah

#s75
i- i- they were very good at first

#s76
they were in very good financials at first

#s77
and uh that 's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well

#s78
And then of course the bottom fell out

#s83
And spare the economy

#s84
Yeah

#s85
it 's really it 's a hard balance

#s86
It it definitely is

#s87
Even not for government

#s88
even just say for a small business

#s89
Uh I know some
