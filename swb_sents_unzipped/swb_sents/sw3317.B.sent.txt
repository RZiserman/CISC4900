Well uh we live in a a brick home in far north Dallas

#s4
and it 's uh four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back

#s5
and It 's about thirty-five hundred square feet

#s11
Yeah

#s14
It is

#s15
Have you been living there very long

#s17
So you 've been there longer

#s18
We built this one about uh

#s19
it 's been

#s20
let 's see

#s21
it 's been six years six and a half years ago

#s23
and we subcontracted it out ourselves

#s24
We bought the lot and uh had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications

#s27
and then we subbed it out

#s28
so we 've been here a little over six years now And uh have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in

#s32
My husband got his big garage

#s33
He ha- we have a three car garage that he has a big work area in

#s35
and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines

#s36
and so he has all the work space he needs

#s39
He

#s42
It is

#s43
and that 's why we decided to build

#s44
We looked at things that were already uh built

#s46
and the garages were always if the house w- was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
So we put a three car garage in

#s52
But even if they had three car garages they did n't have a work space

#s53
All of it was taken up with just car space

#s55
And so he has a big landing area that 's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on

#s60
Well sounds like our husbands have similar interests

#s63
Oh I see

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
Well that 's nice that it 's not in your house

#s68
Uh-huh

#s72
Uh-huh

#s76
Right

#s78
Well we still have a a son and daughter in college that come home

#s80
And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband 's family come

#s81
His parents come

#s82
and also the kids have friends who come and stay

#s84
and so it seems like it 's always used as a bedroom

#s90
Right

#s91
Oh I understand

#s94
Well we

#s95
That 's true

#s96
and you do n't want them to not be able to come because there 's no room

#s100
Well I c- I have n't reached that point yet

#s101
I 've heard people say that

#s102
But uh my middle son is engaged

#s103
my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while

#s105
He 's out of college and has a good job

#s107
so he could afford to get married but is not engaged yet

#s109
and my daughter 's been going with the same boy for a while

#s110
but she 's still in college

#s111
and we 're just as happy for her to finish her education first

#s113
That 's what she plans to do

#s115
So I hope so

#s118
Oh ho-ho

#s120
A whole new world

#s121
Uh-huh

#s123
I can understand

#s127
Uh-huh

#s129
So you 're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute

#s131
Yeah

#s135
Well that 's the same thing that I did

#s136
I hope I 'll be able to do the same with grandchildren

#s144
Um uh-huh

#s150
Well we have
