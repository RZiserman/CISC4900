Do you have any children

#s5
Oh

#s6
I work in a day-care center

#s7
MUMBLEx

#s9
Yes

#s10
I enjoy it a lot

#s14
Oh

#s16
Do they go to a day-care center

#s17
or do they stay at

#s20
Oh that 's nice

#s23
Oh that 's nice

#s26
I I think so

#s27
I think it 's hard to find a good day care

#s28
I have worked in anoth- at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion

#s30
But this one that I 'm in now is is very good

#s31
And one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children

#s33
And like in Pennsylvania for babies that 's what I work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most

#s34
No more than four babies per care giver

#s36
But we keep it down to like two to one

#s38
Yeah

#s39
that makes it a little easier to deal with

#s42
Oh I know

#s43
We

#s46
What we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are um low to the ground

#s48
and they 're reenforced real strong

#s49
and they 'll sit four babies

#s50
We would just lie them in there

#s51
and they roll real well and maneuver

#s53
That will get them out

#s56
No

#s58
Right

#s60
Right

#s62
Yeah

#s63
that 's certainly something we hope never happens

#s66
Most really care in this center really care

#s67
Uh most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education

#s69
And really there 's only like eight children per room

#s70
and then there 's like two or three mostly three care givers in each room

#s72
And that enables them to spend more time with the children

#s73
Sometimes I feel like all I 'm doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap

#s74
So it 's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them

#s76
It 's easy to get attached to them too

#s79
Um in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months

#s81
And throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve

#s83
So I have the real real young ones in my room

#s85
Uh-huh

#s87
They 're you know they 're wonderful

#s88
They do n't complain too much

#s90
Yes

#s91
They are a lot of fun

#s95
Not quite

#s96
It 's a

#s97
when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things

#s98
and

#s100
you have to be real careful all the everything is baby proof

#s101
You know all the doors have latches and stuff so they ca n't get into anything

#s102
but they try

#s105
yeah

#s106
In my area

#s107
because w- I live in a college town in Penn State University

#s109
so I

#s110
there is a lot of a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what 's going on

#s112
And uh in general though I 've I 've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers I 've worked at and it all and all

#s114
it 's not my choice for when when I have children

#s115
but but some people do n't have a choice

#s117
Yes

#s121
Uh-huh

#s123
That is sad

#s129
What

#s131
Oh my God

#s134


#
Oh my God

#s138
Oh that poor child

#s141
That 's awful

#s144
I
