Hi

#s2
So do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have

#s6
Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then

#s10
Um

#s12
Well I read uh

#s13
I get a bunch of different things

#s14
I get a newspaper every day

#s15
and I try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that

#s16
and I look through uh

#s17
I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I I pretty much read that cover to cover

#s18
and I as far as you know

#s19
that satisfies most of the short term news I get

#s20
Uh do n't watch much T V

#s21
do n't have enough time

#s22
and uh do n't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know

#s23
they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened

#s25
and that 's about all I ever hear of it

#s26
Uh but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK

#s27
and for the longer term I I read uh like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and and uh READERS ' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they

#s28
the news is n't like immediate what you 'd generally think of as news

#s29
but it 's recent material

#s31
Yeah

#s32
it is it is more in depth less broad

#s33
Well actually it 's probably is n't less broad

#s34
but it 's just more in depth

#s35
and uh it is it is more sig- it is more just significant information you know

#s36
It is the big events not the little events

#s38
Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main you know

#s41
Yes

#s42
or they 're making making time because they to fill in an hour 's worth of news

#s44
Uh I get kind of bored watching T V actually when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow

#s47
and then there 's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting

#s51
Yeah

#s52
that that 's about what it ends up being

#s53
Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something

#s59
Yeah

#s60
I think they 're about the same

#s61
I you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind

#s62
And uh uh what what kind of uh what kind of news normally interests you

#s63
I mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring

#s65
Uh-huh

#s67
I think it will

#s68
uh they they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence

#s69
but we 've yet to see it

#s70
th-

#s71
it 's real short term yet though

#s72
I mean it 's only been three months or something like that since that happened

#s74
so

#s76
But they like to tell us that it 's going to be important

#s78
I think it is too

#s79
Yeah

#s80
I I think that 's a possibility

#s81
uh it we might also be helped though because it it will be easier to do business over there too

#s84
For the companies that already have a presence over there

#s85
and uh I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time

#s89
Yep

#s90
Because once you 're in there then you can easily expand

#s91
But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult

#s95
Yes

#s97
And there 's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist

#s98
even amongst themselves they 're being somewhat protectionist you know

#s100
Like England does n't want to do one thing

#s101
and and Sweden does n't want to do other thing

#s102
and they 're they 've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet

#s104
And some of it I mean is

#s105
I 'm sure within those people 's minds it 's quite justified

#s111
Uh-huh

#s112
Before they open up their borders to everyone

#s115
Uh what is the uh

#s116
do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that

#s120
Against your will

#s123
Yeah

#s124
at least you guys have a remote control

#s125
It 's sometimes better to not have one of those

#s126
Course you can always mislocate it Or misplace it I mean not mislocate it but misplace it

#s127
and
