Lynn do you do you want to start

#s3
Okay

#s5
Do you want to tell me about summer vacations you 've taken

#s6
or

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
Which is your favorite

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Your family does n't live close then

#s18
Okay

#s21
Yep

#s22
I understand

#s25
Wow

#s26
I 've only been there once

#s28
and I 'd love to go back

#s31
And it was

#s33
Yeah

#s34
it

#s37
we had a great time

#s46
Well uh we we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year

#s47
and but this year we 're not going to be taking one for several reasons

#s48
But vacations we really enjoy

#s49
I think we 've been on three cruises

#s51
And we we really love cruises

#s52
We 've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES

#s54
And uh we 've gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go

#s55
Uh we usually book just a month before it 's ready to go

#s57
And we get upgraded

#s58
Last ti- last two times in fact we had an outside room

#s59
and it was beautiful

#s61
And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around

#s62
It 's kind of

#s65
Oh my God you do everything

#s66
You I mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be

#s67
You can sit in the sun all day around the pool

#s68
or you can take part in the games that they have going on

#s69
They always have bingo

#s70
They have a casino

#s71
Uh they have a massage parlor

#s72
They have exercise

#s73
I mean you can do anything

#s75
And that 's just aboard ship

#s76
And then when the ship docks you get to go sight-seeing and shopping

#s78
And that 's quite fun

#s81
Uh Nassau San Juan Saint Thomas

#s82
We 've been there twice

#s83
We went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people

#s84
We we 've gone with friends each time

#s86
And then we went to uh the western Caribbean which is uh Port uh Cancun Cozumel and Ocho Rios

#s88
Pardon me

#s90
Yes

#s91
uh-huh

#s92
And but it was wonderful

#s93
So we really like those

#s94
And uh I guess we just like to go someplace someplace entirely different

#s95
We 've been to a few places in this country

#s96
We still have a lot to see though

#s98
We 're from Illinois originally

#s100
And we 've been down in Texas eighteen years

#s101
and so like you we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives

#s102
We both still have family there

#s104
And that 's fun

#s105
It brings back a lot of memories

#s107
Uh things are different there though

#s108
They 're uh

#s109
I do n't know

#s110
It 's just entirely different world than this area

#s113
Did you

#s115
Uh-huh

#s119
Uh-huh

#s123
Uh-huh

#s125
Oh that 's great

#s131
Oh they they they really are

#s132
We 've yeah as I said we 've done them three times

#s133
We 'd be going again this this year if circumstances had n't changed

#s134
We we 'd probably go

#s136
My husband would you know

#s137
the minute I said the word he he he 's chomping at the bit

#s138
He kind of likes the casinos a little bit

#s140
But I like all of that

#s142
I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places

#s144
I like shopping

#s145
I can shop anyplace shop in London and France and wherever

#s146
Now my kids are moving to Toronto

#s147
so we 're going to be able to go up there

#s149
So I 'm kind of looking forward to that except I hate to see them go

#s151
But

#s154
Oh that 's what everybody says

#s155
and I I think it 's

#s156
I think I 'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January

#s158
So that will be hard to stay away from

#s160
Yeah

#s163
Is n't that the truth

#s164
uh-huh

#s167
Well there 's all age grou- groups too

#s168
and that 's that 's kind of fun

#s169
Uh you if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people

#s171
You may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger

#s172
and everybody is really interesting

#s173
and everybody is there to have a good time

#s174
and

#s177
Uh we 've only gone on the seven day cruises

#s179
They have shorter ones

#s180
and then they have ten day ones

#s181
But I think seven days is long enough for us

#s182
By that time we 're ready to get home and get back to our routine

#s184
I think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us

#s185
We 've gone

#s186
I think when we went to England and France we were there ten twelve days

#s187
and that was pushing it a bit

#s191
Yeah

#s192
Well that that makes sense

#s193
it really does

#s194
I mean oh we went to Panama too

#s196
Went to Panama last August

#s198
Our son-in-law is from Panama

#s200
And uh we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there

#s202
And his father is a a doctor

#s203
and his mother is a kindergarten teacher

#s204
and they took time off

#s205
it was their winter

#s206
and they were having a little break

#s207
so they took some time off that uh they could show us around

#s208
And it it is a beautiful country

#s210
It is beautiful

#s211
They have mountains

#s212
We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore

#s214
And it it is gorgeous

#s215
They live in a small town called David which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica

#s217
And uh it 's it 's just it 's just a gorgeous country

#s218
Most people do n't realize it

#s219
I think if they could get tourists coming to their country they 'd improve the economy considerably

#s221
Yeah

#s222
We really hope hope so

#s225
Yeah

#s228
Well that that 's that 's pretty good

#s229
That 's pretty good

#s233
Oh do you like L A
