Okay

#s2
Go ahead

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Huh

#s10
Right

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
Right

#s18
I I think that might be talking referring to uh something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know

#s19
Either you have uh military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years

#s22
Right

#s23
right

#s25
Huh

#s26
Right

#s27
right

#s32
Well i-

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
Right

#s37
Yeah

#s39
Yeah

#s40
yeah

#s41
i- i-

#s42
for for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school

#s44
Uh kind of in lieu of the draft for for people who do n't uh who you know are conscientious objectors or do n't otherwise want e- e- to be in the military you know

#s45
Say okay well you can go into the military

#s46
or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and learn about things

#s47
And i- it 's interesting because I I 'm not a particular fan of the military

#s48
but I have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that do n't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and are n't terribly disciplined you know even just personal discipline about what they want to do

#s49
and they come out

#s50
and they they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline

#s51
And they have uh you know in in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that you know if I do something or sub- submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time I can accomplish a lot

#s52
and it it 's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn That they do n't need to be you know cowboys

#s53
They do n't need to be out there and uh you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished

#s54
And you know for some for some young men that 's good

#s55
For me it would have been lousy i- idea uh because I I did have th- the personal discipline

#s57
And I went to college for four years and got out you know

#s59
so But uh you know for some people that 's good

#s60
I I do n't particular like the fact that it 's the military you know

#s61
MUMBLEx

#s62
and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially As as an instrument of U S policy

#s67
Well that 's one view

#s68
And and you know and that that 's another debate

#s69
But uh it 's uh

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
Right

#s73
right

#s74
and well it 's it it seems pretty aggre- aggressive oriented

#s75
I mean you you look at the last mis- military action which was in the Persian Gulf and was n't anywhere near the United States

#s76
and it was uh you know it was definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe

#s77
so at at any rate this is getting off the topic

#s78
but i-

#s79
my my point was that there is for people who do n't want to do the military service there it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and uh sense of community that the Boy Scouts
