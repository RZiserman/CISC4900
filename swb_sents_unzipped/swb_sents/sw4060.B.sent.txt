#s3
Okay

#s4
I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement You know not to get in like in a dead end job

#s6
And plus for me it 's uh I mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental

#s8
They 're also important

#s11
Um

#s14
Um

#s15
Are they like pretty much train for a specific job

#s16
and that what I hired for and then I just very little variation from that

#s20
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s26
Well you know that 's interesting though

#s27
Because I do n't know if that 's necessarily the case anymore

#s28
I use to think that you know after you work

#s29
you mean security job security

#s32
Uh that use to be I think a couple of years ago

#s33
but I do n't know if it is so much anymore

#s34
In fact they we just had a lay off in what November I guess

#s36
But uh it was n't necessarily

#s37
I mean you know some people had been there a long time

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s45
No doubt

#s47
yeah

#s52
Expedient

#s53
yeah

#s54
that 's exactly it

#s55
Yeah

#s56
where the most dollar where where you know it cuts back the most

#s57
Oh

#s58
Oh

#s59
See yeah

#s61
Yeah

#s62
I think that 's one of the things too

#s63
You get too many management people you know

#s65
Yeah

#s66
and it 's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know

#s68
And then they wonder why it does n't get done in the same amount of time

#s69
Well those people are n't there anymore

#s72
Yeah

#s73
Uh-huh

#s74
Yeah

#s75
but

#s76
so what else do you think is important

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
I think probably in a small

#s89
yeah

#s90
I was going to say more it 's more personal for one thing

#s91
You probably have a better team uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere

#s93
Probably

#s94
where as in a bigger corporation I think you 're just a number you know

#s97
Uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
whereas yeah in a smaller

#s102
I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished you know

#s106
Uh-huh
