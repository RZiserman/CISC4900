Okay

#s2
well just to let you know I have uh two uh children of my own

#s3
I 've got two boys uh one four year old and one two years old

#s4
so I 'm just starting out

#s7
Wow

#s8
Wow

#s9
that 's quite a spread

#s12
That 's great

#s14
Well I guess uh in one of the things that that I like to do with my boys when uh when I get home is I like to try and spend a lot of time with them

#s15
You know they 're not very old

#s16
so they could n't do a whole lot yet

#s18
But they like to uh spend time with me

#s19
We just oh just do various things nothing really

#s20
They like to be outside as much as possible

#s22
Right uh

#s23
but you know the weather 's trying to turn now

#s24
so

#s26
Yes

#s27
I I 'm I 'm in uh Dallas

#s32
Right

#s33
right

#s35
Right

#s38
Yeah

#s39
what

#s40
w- well

#s41
one of the things I 've noticed is one of the trends I 've I 've noticed is that uh it 's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let them watch movies or or play video games or something

#s45
Sure

#s47
Sure

#s49
That 's okay

#s56
No

#s57
it 's okay

#s58
Uh so that was the thing that I I noticed that I know a lot of people lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing

#s59
And one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible Although it really is very easy to do that type of thing Just plop them down in front of the T V and let them be uh entertained that way

#s61
And uh seeing as you 've got some older children I I 'm wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up

#s65
Uh-huh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
Right

#s74
Right

#s77
Um

#s81
Right

#s83
Uh-huh

#s85
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s89
Yeah

#s93
Right

#s99
Uh-huh

#s101
Uh-huh

#s104
Right

#s106
Oh that 's nice

#s109
That 's great

#s111
That 's great

#s112
I know we 'd I 'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things

#s113
And I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older

#s115
But uh you know for right now they do n't you know

#s116
just getting out in the front and just being outside is good for them

#s117
because they like just being outside

#s121
Uh-huh

#s123
Uh-huh

#s125
Right

#s127
That 's true

#s128
you do n't see many leaves around Dallas

#s131
Uh-huh
