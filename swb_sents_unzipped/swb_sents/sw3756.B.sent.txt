#s3
Yes

#s4
I have

#s5
That room I showed you

#s7
And then since then we have painted the bedroom

#s10
Yeah

#s11
I showed you that one too did n't I

#s12
The brown one

#s16
Yeah

#s17
the one that looks like a fudgesicle

#s19
Yeah

#s22
Yeah

#s24
Oh yeah

#s25
Well that is hard

#s26
Now I asked Janice or somebody recently how you do that uh when you paint the ceilings you know where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with

#s30
How do you get the edge

#s32
You just have to be real careful

#s34
We use uh uh a two inch brush with uh on a slant

#s37
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes

#s38
But

#s41
Well yeah

#s42
I think I am going to do it this spring actually

#s44
Yeah

#s45
there are six houses

#s46
See the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that that we do As far as the the materials

#s48
There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses

#s50
So I am thinking I am going to change it to uh something you know

#s51
the brick is multi color Mostly earth tones

#s53
I think I am going to put something like a brown on it on the outside And maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little

#s56
What color did you paint

#s58
Yeah

#s59
There are some columns that could be painted a different color too

#s61
What color did you paint your house

#s63
On the out

#s67
Well you have got to get one of those ladders

#s70
Oh yeah

#s71
A friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house

#s72
and that is what he

#s73
I was out there last week

#s74
and he has finished everything except the chimney

#s80
Yeah

#s83
Well our house in New Mexico it was stucco

#s84
but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it

#s86
And we did basically seventy-five percent of the house

#s87
and then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff

#s89
So I hired this man to come in and do it A young kid

#s91
And he came with with his own raf-

#s92
what do you call those things

#s94
No

#s95
those where you built like a rafter thing

#s99
Yeah

#s100
Scaffold

#s102
He came and did it that way

#s103
and I think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up

#s105
And literally I would n't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that I had left for him were above huge humongous cactus

#s108
and if he fell he was dead

#s109
and he knew that

#s110
So

#s113
Yeah

#s114
Plus he cleaned up my mess

#s117
Uh-huh

#s120
How much did it cost you for the paint for the outside

#s122
Yeah

#s126
Yeah

#s127
But that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to uh MUMBLEx I guess to buy his paint

#s131
and yet he bought like seventeen gallons

#s133
And anyway he when he checked out and he was using his MUMBLEx charge card too They only charged him for one gallon of paint

#s134
Like thirteen bucks or something

#s138
And he had he had the uh he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that

#s140
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint

#s142
so she had to start all over again

#s144
and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something

#s146
And he saw MUMBLEx

#s148
Yeah

#s149
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff

#s153
Yeah

#s158
Uh Rollers are so messy

#s159
We never MUMBLEx any more

#s162
Well a little paintbrush
