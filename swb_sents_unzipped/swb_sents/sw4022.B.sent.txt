#s4
Uh-huh

#s5
Yeah

#s6
it kind of seems to me that everyone 's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it 's when it 's just such a bad time for it

#s11
Yeah

#s12
The ninety-seven cents a week

#s17
Uh-huh

#s20
Yeah

#s21
I mean mostly it 's it 's not actually a a a cut

#s22
it 's just a cut in the withhold in the amount withheld you know

#s24
Um yeah

#s25
I do n't see this MUMBLEx changing my lifestyle a whole lot

#s27
Huh-uh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s31
Yeah

#s32
I mean you know in retrospect um was it was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know I 'll I 'll tell you right now I 'm going to raise taxes

#s34
It was Dukakis

#s35
yeah

#s37
I have a lot of respect for him

#s41
Yeah

#s44
Uh-huh

#s45
Uh-huh

#s49
Uh-huh

#s52
Oh yeah

#s53
Yeah

#s54
it 's it 's

#s57
Uh-huh

#s59
Uh-huh

#s60
Oh yeah

#s61
I uh I I think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where

#s64
It wou- it wou- it would help unemployment greatly

#s65
And it

#s67
Yeah

#s68
infra structure is in is in

#s69
I mean we we we have hurt ourselves incredibly MUMBLEx last fifty years in the cold war

#s73
Uh-huh

#s74
Um yeah

#s75
I I agree totally

#s76
Um I mean this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen

#s77
Um I I 'm in college right now

#s78
and

#s80
Oh really

#s81
where do you go

#s83
Right

#s84
I go to Georgia Tech um

#s86
And in

#s87
what

#s88
I had pol- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago

#s90
And one of the things we discussed was you know where our where the budget situate- how the budget situation just got so out of hand

#s92
And essentially what happened was

#s93
I think it was like in the um tax year of eighty-one um

#s94
Ronald Reagan basically said you know I 'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the Congress would not in their right mind pass

#s96
and Con- Congress realizing that they were going to lose a the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know bye-bye you know bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit

#s99
And you just MUMBLEx

#s101
I mean it 's just like they 're playing chicken with a loaded gun

#s106
Yeah

#s108
Uh-huh

#s109
Well yeah

#s110
um what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well I 'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we 're MUMBLEx we 're going to have to do some unpopular things I mean he would n't have a chance of getting elected

#s113
I mean it 's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where people just want want to have you know whatever will make them feel good right now you know

#s116
Uh-huh

#s117
Uh-huh

#s119
Uh-huh

#s121
Uh-huh

#s122
It

#s123
I mean I do n't know

#s124
I I do n't I do n't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week

#s128
I just do n't think it was a well thought out incentive
