I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently

#s3
Uh

#s5
In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that 's presented

#s6
I have uh very little regard for the law presently practiced

#s9
I was thinking primarily criminal cases

#s11
Yes

#s12
Uh-huh

#s13
That 's a concern of mine

#s14
Uh I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges Uh you know doing the sentencing

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
Yeah

#s21
my question I guess are they really your peers

#s24
Uh Uh too often I think they are not

#s27
and uh when you when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too

#s29
Uh I think that uh in such cases uh they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased

#s31
Uh now I happen to know several judges

#s32
and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury

#s33
I would feel a little bit uneasy about

#s35
but the other two I feel uh would give either you know the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law

#s37
And I guess that 's what I am concerned with

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
This is very true

#s47
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
Yeah

#s51
and you do see such uneven sentencing you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such I mean where uh it would appear the crimes were very similar

#s54
but one individual got twenty-five years

#s55
and the other one was sentenced to life

#s56
So

#s58
Uh

#s60
Is n't that the truth

#s62
There are times when

#s63
is it uh

#s64
oh goodness my mind has gone blank

#s65
it 's uh Othello

#s66
You know where he says kill all the lawyers

#s67
Every now and then one is tempted to see what what

#s70
But I it 's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of you know as as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice

#s77
Uh-huh

#s79
And they are very effective too

#s82
Uh even

#s83
I have been involved just sli- slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty

#s85
but uh his attorneys gotten him off

#s87
Uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge

#s88
So I do n't know
