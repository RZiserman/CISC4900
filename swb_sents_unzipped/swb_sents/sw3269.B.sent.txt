#s4
Oh yes

#s13
Well I was from Illinois originally

#s14
and I grew up a Bear fan

#s15
And uh then we moved here

#s16
even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans

#s18
And we had some wonderful wonderful years there under Roger Staubach

#s19
And we kind of got spoiled

#s21
We expected it to continue forever

#s22
I think they 're doing pretty well this year though

#s24
I think two

#s26
I know they lost yeah to Washington and Philadelphia

#s30
Yeah

#s31
and was n't that fun

#s32
I went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me

#s33
and I must say I attracted a lot of attention

#s35
People running up saying oh what 's the score what 's the score

#s37
That 's right

#s38
and that 's exactly what they said

#s39
my wife dragged me away from the television

#s41
You know but I was n't

#s42
I had forgotten

#s43
or I probably would n't have been there

#s52
Yeah

#s57
That 's exactly where both of the wives came from I think

#s59
It was uh you know

#s60
it 's easier to join them than fight them

#s63
And if you want to see them you might just as well enjoy football

#s65
And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh yo- did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games

#s73
Well it takes a little brainwashing first

#s75
Yeah

#s78
Are you uh transit usually

#s79
I mean do you stay not in one place too long

#s87
Well it will take you a little while

#s88
but you 'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver

#s96
Oh I know

#s98
Well if they close it in see we 'll have the best of both worlds then as they 're talking about doing

#s100
But uh Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway

#s102
Yeah

#s103
that 's right you know

#s105
he was one of ours one of our boys

#s107
So we are never we never cheer against Denver unless they 're playing the Cowboys

#s109
Yeah

#s116
Uh-huh

#s122
Johnny Elway

#s129
Well there is so much about it to like

#s131
You know it 's so exciting

#s133
And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here of course they put together some real cute songs

#s134
and we all ran out and bought the records

#s135
and now we feel like they 're kind of a collector 's item

#s143
Uh-huh
