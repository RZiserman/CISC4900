So do you have an opinion on credit cards

#s3
You do

#s5
I think they get a lot of people in trouble

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Yeah

#s13
and then you do n't stop to realize that you know

#s14
you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty

#s15
and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars

#s16
and you do n't stop to think about it

#s18
I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble

#s20
And then you know so I eventually got it all paid

#s21
Now I carry one

#s22
I have a gas card and a Visa card

#s23
And I never use them unless I need to

#s25
So but they

#s31
Yeah

#s32
That 's a good idea

#s33
Stops all them interest rates

#s35
and interest rates are n't none too shallow these days anyway

#s38
But I know a lot of people that get in trouble with them

#s39
especially you know

#s40
we have

#s41
I 'm in Lubbock

#s42
and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech

#s43
and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot

#s47
Yeah

#s50
Gee

#s53
Yes

#s54
something like that

#s56
Yeah

#s59
Well my wife got in trouble one time with hers

#s60
She was making like I do n't know what she was making forty-five dollars a month I think

#s61
And fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit

#s62
and fifteen dollars of it was interest

#s63
so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month

#s65
So and that was before we got married

#s66
so

#s67
But it 's

#s68
you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it

#s69
and it 's it 's come out pretty good

#s70
Now we have a eighteen year old that 's fixing to get out of high school and go to college

#s72
That 's the first thing he wanted

#s74
Yeah

#s76
So we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick

#s78
You know so

#s83
But I think they 're too readily accessible

#s85
and there 's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you dra- get you trapped

#s86
I mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it

#s87
but that 's a lot of pain and hassle

#s88
When you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we could n't afford everything we did n't have such things as credit cards

#s89
We just waited until time come around that we could afford it

#s91
And you know we had all the necessities

#s92
so And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities

#s93
I always use it for something I want not something I need

#s95
So

#s99
Yeah

#s101
I think if card cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably would n't have the problems we have

#s103
Of course we would n't have the retail market we have either

#s104
so I guess they trade one for the other

#s106
I disagree with it

#s107
but they still trade one for the other

#s109
Well that 's good

#s110
I 'm

#s111
it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for

#s112
you sound pretty young

#s113
so

#s116
Are you

#s117
Yeah

#s120
All right

#s125


#
Yeah

#s130
Yeah

#s131
it 's pretty easy

#s136
Uh we have a eighteen year old seventeen year old and a seven year old

#s138
Yeah

#s141
Oh are you

#s144
Are you a you 're a Mormon then

#s146
Oh all right

#s148
What 's that

#s150
Oh yeah

#s151
They may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays

#s154
Uh fifteen or twenty I guess

#s156
Oh yeah

#s158
I try to every day

#s159
I uh I get calls at work

#s160
I get calls at home

#s161
so
