All right do you do exercise

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Right

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Right

#s15
Right

#s17
Well um that 's a hard question to answer because I do physical things but I do n't always set out for them to be exercise

#s19
I walk with my parents occasionally

#s20
nothing 's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule

#s21
and um I play racquetball

#s22
but I have n't since I 've been out of school

#s23
I do n't have anywhere to do that

#s24
but that 's going to start soon again

#s26
and um I play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise

#s28
Because I really do n't like to exercise

#s29
I think that 's the basic point of it is I 'm not I I do n't enjoy it if I know that it 's exercise

#s31
but if it 's like a social activity or a recreational activity I do n't mind

#s33
so I have to disguise it

#s34
it 's like feeding little babies food and telling them it 's something else so that they 'll eat it

#s36
That 's kind of the same thing for me

#s37
I have to not know that it 's exercise so I can do it

#s40
Well yeah

#s41
if it 's exercise it 's a task

#s43
I do n't want to do anything I have to do

#s45
I mean I 'll voluntarily clean the bathroom

#s46
but I wo n't do it if I have to do it

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
Right

#s52
I 'm twenty-two

#s54
Right

#s56
Right

#s58
Uh-huh

#s62
Right

#s65
Right

#s66
Eating right and no cholesterol and all that

#s70
Yeah

#s71
we

#s72
I 'm sure I will do

#s73
I 'm doing that more and more than I used to

#s75
I 'm getting better about this knowing that I need exercise and doing it

#s76
but it 's still at the task stage

#s78
Is it a pleasure for you

#s79
or are you

#s82
Right

#s87
Right

#s91
Uh-huh

#s94
Oh

#s96
Uh-huh

#s97
Right

#s102
Uh-huh

#s105
Right

#s106
that 's

#s107
I never got past that stage

#s111
Right

#s116
Uh-huh

#s117
Right

#s119
That 's good

#s122
Yeah

#s125
Uh-huh

#s128
Right

#s129
that 's it

#s130
I do the occasional push up and sit up

#s131
I have n't really brought myself to go to the the gym because that 's very stressful to me

#s133
because I feel I felt real competitive there

#s134
and I need to find some place I could go and not feel like there 's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are

#s139
Right

#s142
Uh-huh

#s145
Right

#s147
Right

#s150
Uh-huh

#s151
That 's a good idea

#s152
but I do have my ride

#s153
we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house

#s155
I 'll do those once in a while just you know like at eleven thirty when Love Connection 's on and I ca n't sleep

#s159
I 'll get up and stair step for half an hour

#s161
so

#s163
It 's I guess pretty pretty healthy

#s164
but I do n't have a regular plan that 's

#s166
I need to get started on that

#s169
Right

#s171
Uh-huh

#s174
Uh-huh

#s177
Sleep

#s180
Uh-huh

#s183
Yeah

#s186
Right

#s188
That 'll come some day when I

#s192
Right

#s193
Well I hope so

#s195
Yeah

#s196
sounds good

#s198
Yeah

#s199
you too

#s200
Have a nice day

#s203
Bye
