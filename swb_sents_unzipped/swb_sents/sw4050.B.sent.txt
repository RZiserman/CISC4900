#s5
That 's okay

#s6
I 'm Bill from Raleigh

#s9
Oh another one from a different state besides Texas

#s13
Right

#s16
Uh yes and no

#s17
it was n't really a fa- a planning one

#s18
but it was kind of uh it was a birthday

#s20
and I brought a lot of family together then

#s23
It went pretty good

#s24
I 'm I 've worked in hotels

#s25
so I I kind of know how to do these things

#s27
I used to you know

#s30
Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it 's my grandmother 's birthday

#s31
and and it 's all of like

#s32
she she comes from a big family

#s34
She has like seven sisters I think

#s36
They show up and all their kids

#s37
And then all

#s38
she has uh

#s39
I have like uh

#s40
let 's see

#s41
she has four sons and two daughters

#s42
and they show up and all their kids

#s44
so it 's a pretty big reunion

#s45
it 's about two hundred people maybe

#s48
Um the probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh

#s50
I guess probably the most helpful thing was that um for the rent we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that

#s53
And uh each one of the everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks

#s54
and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill

#s57
each person in the family you know brought a dish or something

#s62
It was kind of pot luck

#s64
You know everybody brought their specialties I guess you would say

#s68
Yeah

#s69
And of course my grandmother 's food was as always gone first because she 's such a great cook

#s73
Uh she 's eighty-six

#s77
Now she does

#s78
she looks probably like she 's in her early sixties

#s80
and if she did n't have arthritis she 'd get around better than me as a matter of fact

#s85
Oh yeah

#s86
My nickname for her is Honey Woman

#s87
That 's what I call her

#s97
Uh also one thing that 's helpful

#s98
and I do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever

#s100
but most of all my family lives like in the same county

#s101
so

#s103
But it 's just kind of like get on the telephone

#s104
and it 's so and such days from such and such date

#s106
and everybody just shows up

#s110
I would say you 're spread out then

#s112
Uh my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters I guess we 're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever

#s113
because my dad was in the Army

#s114
and we 're we 're pretty strung out all over

#s116
But since they 've moved back to Carolinas we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County

#s119
I live in Raleigh

#s120
and then my my parents live in Greenville

#s121
and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and uh another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville

#s123
So I mean we 're we 're spread out

#s124
but everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro

#s126
so

#s128
Nobody moves away except us

#s130
Yeah

#s131
I got out as soon as I graduated

#s134
Just like this town is too small for me

#s135
Good-bye
