#s2
Okay

#s3
Uh I do n't think they should abolish it

#s4
I think I think if they put it into force more often they would n't have as many problems as they 've got

#s6
Right

#s7
No

#s8
no

#s9
For major things like premeditated murder Mass murders Uh you know that type of thing

#s10
I do n't think it should just be used loosely

#s12
Well

#s15
Yes

#s16
yes

#s17
To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street By you know some technicality

#s18
And they go down the line ten years

#s19
and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before

#s21
And you know that 's about the only thing

#s22
Like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know I do n't think they should do that

#s24
Oh well I guess if I if it was someone in my family I 'd probably feel that way

#s25
You know I 've never had anybody in my immediate family uh murdered

#s26
and so I really would n't know

#s27
But but I feel like if I did I probably would feel that way

#s30
Uh-huh

#s32
Right

#s34
Well that 's true

#s38
Besides him

#s39
Okay

#s43
His life is n't worth very much then

#s48
Right

#s50
Potential

#s51
I mean that 's that 's the key right there Potential

#s53
Now are they are they rehabilitative or or not

#s56
Uh-huh

#s60
I can imagine

#s63
Yes

#s65
Was he murdered

#s66
Did they find who killed him

#s70
So it has n't been a long time ago

#s71
Just recently

#s75
Yeah

#s76
yeah

#s77
That appeals process I mean it 's what you know really you know just drags out and out and out

#s78
My brother-in-law here in Texas his by marriage my sister 's uh husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy in in well actually in Houston

#s79
and uh he
