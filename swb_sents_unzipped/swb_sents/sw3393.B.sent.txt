#s2
So what do you guys having up there

#s3
I have n't been up there since oh Lord forty-eight I guess

#s7
Well no

#s8
it was n't forty-eight

#s9
it was it was uh let 's see yeah it was forty-eight

#s10
I was in the Air Force

#s12
We did an air show out at uh out at uh Boone Greene no out at uh Andrews

#s14
yeah

#s15
So what 's it been like up there

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Yeah

#s20
Uh like September was hot and dry

#s21
October

#s26
Really

#s27
Huh

#s28
It really has been strange here this year

#s29
I mean this whole ye- course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one

#s31
But uh we had uh you know all these we have all these uh

#s32
somebody said you know you 're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather

#s33
but Well always they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever

#s35
and we had all this rain

#s36
and it really is not a bad summer at all

#s37
really cool

#s38
But all of a sudden in in uh in October uh September October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time

#s39
And uh then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping

#s40
just pouring down you know

#s41
There were flash floods everywhere

#s42
that kind of deal

#s43
and then uh into of November the first like the second week uh you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze

#s45
and the average you know the average uh first frost is like the fifteenth of November here

#s47
but usually it 's not until later

#s48
It 's really strange

#s51
Yeah

#s55
Is it is it is it flooding anywhere

#s61
It 's just kind of uh clou-

#s62
we 're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here uh which will be you know a little bit more typical uh autumn weather

#s63
But really it 's strange

#s64
We have n't really had an autumn

#s65
It 's like we went into winter

#s67
you know the poor trees said what

#s73
Yeah

#s74
uh it 's

#s75
Yeah

#s76
there you you know

#s77
usually there 's uh

#s78
I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas

#s79
and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine you know

#s80
it 's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff

#s82
and uh I was up there last weekend

#s83
and there are trees that that still have their leaves on

#s84
and they 're green

#s85
but they 're dead

#s86
You know the the freeze just got them

#s88
They they were n't ready for it at all apparently

#s89
and and we have n't had a typical fall at all

#s90
Not much color you know changes have occurred at all

#s91
Really weird this year

#s92
I 'm not sure what that what that means

#s97
So you you all actually had some color huh

#s100
It kind of crept in

#s101
and

#s104
Yeah

#s105
it 's usually beautiful up there is n't it

#s107
Gorgeous

#s108
That 's you know

#s109
I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not

#s110
and you could you know you could be driving along in East Texas

#s111
and looks just the same

#s112
It 's almost you know identical kind of country

#s114
Beautiful

#s116
Yeah

#s117
Oh

#s118
Yeah

#s119
I was up I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend

#s120
so

#s122
Little little oak tree that was dead and cut it up and split it MUMBLEx

#s126
Well

#s128
Uh it there 's some trees like the oaks

#s129
like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy

#s130
There 's

#s131
nothing bothers them

#s132
Their leaves are still green

#s133
and some of the other oaks There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves

#s134
Um what I notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead

#s135
the dogwoods still look still look you know

#s136
they got uh bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit

#s137
but they still look pretty good

#s139
It just depends on the on the uh on the tree
