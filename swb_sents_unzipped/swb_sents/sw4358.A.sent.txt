Okay

#s2
What is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling

#s4
Uh-huh

#s5
Well that 's more than we have up here in Massachusetts

#s6
Some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect

#s7
and they do have bins set up

#s8
But I live in a a metropolitan area

#s9
and uh they 're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
I I know a lot I think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort

#s16
Whether

#s17
and and I think that and I know Massachusetts has

#s18
a bottle bill was passed

#s19
and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now

#s20
and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh

#s21
that 's the majority of people that I know of anyways

#s22
Where people are n't really you know eco conscious It 's just the fact that it 's something they have to do

#s23
And I 'm not going to throw a bottle away

#s24
it 's like throwing a nickel away

#s25
That type of thing

#s28
But uh people need to be more conscious of it

#s32
Yeah

#s33
MUMBLEx It did n't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans

#s34
Uh and and matter of fact I think it took like three tries t- for it to go through

#s35
But and it 's been pretty successful

#s36
and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know

#s37
people would dr- have a drink of soda

#s38
instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle

#s39
so it 's it 's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth

#s40
But more importantly it 's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing

#s41
And that 's the big thing I think that th- they try to promote

#s44
Yeah

#s45
that 's a good idea

#s46
Yeah

#s47
Th- there definitely has to be a motivation factor

#s48
and I know that at w- where I work

#s49
I work for a defense contractor

#s50
And there 's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh Styrofoam usage because of the uh the process involved in Styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that

#s51
And and they 're very proactive

#s52
and uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh Styrofoam stuff

#s53
so So i- i- it 's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it

#s54
I think that 's that 's what they need to do Be more proactive like that

#s59
Yeah

#s60
They they just

#s61
matter of fact that that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa-

#s62
the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school

#s63
and what they 'll do is they 'll recycle it

#s64
Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that do n't break down over a long period of time

#s65
A guy went to a d- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty

#s66
because they do n't they do n't degrade over such a period of time

#s68
Yeah

#s71
Yeah

#s73
Yeah

#s74
Okay
