Do you have children

#s6
Oh

#s8
I have one that 's a freshman in high school a daughter And a son who 's a sixth grader in a middle school

#s10
And I spend most of my time carpooling

#s12
The story of my life

#s16
My kids are involved in sports

#s17
My daughter has played basketball for six years

#s18
and my son plays football

#s19
I

#s20
my rule is that they ca n't play a sport the same time of the year because there 's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere

#s24
Yes

#s25
I know

#s26
I know

#s27
The insurance

#s38
Yes

#s39
My son is in both band and scouts too

#s42
Oh gee

#s46
Right

#s49
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s56
We found this Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg

#s59
Have you

#s62
Well it 's really fun

#s63
Um one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis

#s64
and a lot of them played it

#s65
and she started a group going in the neighborhood

#s66
and my kids wanted to learn how to play it

#s67
and it 's more fun with four people

#s70
And it 's a game that none of their friends know how to play

#s71
and they both enjoy it

#s72
So if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad

#s74
So uh we play that a lot of them

#s75
and uh we like to go miniature golfing and to movies

#s77
We have family that lives outside of the state

#s78
so we go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips

#s81
So that

#s82
and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly

#s85
My daughter and and I hate camping

#s86
so we go shopping

#s87
So that just kind of works out real well

#s89
And um I 'm a writer by profession

#s90
and my daughter enjoys writing too

#s91
so a lot of times she and I will travel to writers conferences together

#s93
Yeah

#s94
So Yeah

#s98
So that gives us special time together too

#s100
And she 's on the yearbook staff and things like that

#s101
so I can help her with that

#s102
and she gives me ideas for my writing too

#s103
so

#s105
Yep

#s110
Yeah

#s118
Right

#s121
My husband has taken us to work with him

#s122
and we still do n't know what he does

#s124
So we just say he travels a lot

#s125
So that kind of covers it

#s129
Yes

#s130
Yeah

#s133
He 's been on temporary duties where he 's been gone nine months

#s135
Yes

#s137
So those are the real killers

#s138
If he 's just gone

#s140
he 's gone three weeks right now

#s141
and that 's that 's mild compare to the big ones

#s143
so we just you know I just do the carpooling and and handle whatever needs to be done

#s144
And something major always needs to be done

#s147
So you just have to to handle it until he gets home

#s151
And hopefully he wo n't have too many surprises when he gets home
