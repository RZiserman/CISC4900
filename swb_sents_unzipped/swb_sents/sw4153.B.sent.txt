#s3
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Yeah

#s12


#
Well that

#s16
I know wh-

#s17
the things that we kind of looked at is is you want to see how many teachers you have And and how many kids they have and how they break it up

#s20
Because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in

#s22
It it was a really good one

#s23
and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered

#s24
My wife did artwork for them

#s25
and then you know so we got our day care free

#s27
But they did n't have enough teachers

#s28
and

#s31
Uh-huh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s40
Huh

#s44
Yeah

#s47
Did did they separate them by age group

#s49
Because I 'd think you know I think that 's one thing that was important

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
Yeah

#s57
I- it sound

#s58
yeah

#s60
It sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people Affectionate people that they 're they 're kind of par- may be parents themselves or something

#s70
Uh-huh

#s73
Uh-huh

#s78
Yeah

#s79
I I I think that 's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D 's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff

#s80
but if they do n't reach out and touch the kids then that does n't do any good

#s83
Yeah

#s85
Yeah

#s86
An-

#s87
The other the other group that we had was kind of interesting

#s88
The other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team

#s90
and we knew them from other associations

#s91
but uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one

#s92
and I think you know she would she 'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know

#s93
but he was actually the more um the more uh what demonstrative type The more loving

#s95
he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids

#s96
and and i- it was kind of interesting to see that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it

#s98
An-

#s101
Yeah

#s102
so they had a really nice balance

#s103
We liked that one

#s104
In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something

#s106
but they also did they also did some of the teaching things

#s107
and then they had um you know

#s108
obedience obedience was important

#s111
And you know so they you know they used uh oh I think they used the

#s112
you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself

#s115
And it 's it 's one

#s116
Uh I ca n't remember what they call it actually

#s117
but y- you just stand them in front of a clock

#s118
and you know it has a second-hand that goes around

#s120
And they have to stand there

#
