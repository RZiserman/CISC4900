Up up there maybe maybe you guys do n't have as uh big a problem with air pollution as many do you

#s3
Do you really

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
That 's horrible

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Right

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s22
Right

#s23
right

#s25
Well uh in Dallas I I have n't seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in Denver

#s26
I grew up in Denver

#s27
and and I 've lived there most of my life

#s28
and we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days

#s29
Uh however in Colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down

#s30
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to po- post warnings now you know as far as health concerns

#s32
Uh due to that emi- the the emissions uh uh control on the vehicles seems that all of our all of our uh smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Um

#s38
Uh-huh

#s42
Uh-huh

#s44
Oh really

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
Right

#s53
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s55
yeah

#s56
it it becomes uh

#s57
maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in uh uh some more beautiful parts of the country uh I think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of of what 's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is

#s58
Um I I notice people in in Dallas seem to say Well sure there 's air pollution

#s59
but you know really how bad is how bad could this problem really be

#s62
Oh really

#s63
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s67
Right

#s68
Right

#s70
Do you find that um or or do you hypothesize that that most of the uh smog or or air pollution comes from vehicles

#s71
or does it come mostly from industry up there

#s73
Yeah

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
I had talked with my parents

#s83
I I grew up uh I was born in uh Muncie Indiana and and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute

#s84
and I had asked them before uh

#s85
I went back to visit recently about a year ago

#s86
and I asked them

#s87
I said did you ever realize the air pollution that was
