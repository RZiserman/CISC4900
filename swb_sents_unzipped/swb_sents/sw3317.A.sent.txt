Okay

#s2
what kind of house do you live in

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Well it sounds like ours are pretty similar

#s8
I live in one

#s9
I do n't have a swimming pool

#s10
And mine 's about twenty-seven hundred square foot

#s12
But the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike

#s13
I think it 's pretty much typical for this area

#s16
I 've been in the house I 'm in here right now about twelve and a half years

#s22
Uh-huh

#s25
Oh really

#s26
Uh-huh

#s29
Uh-huh

#s30
Well I bet you

#s31
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s37
Well that sounds interesting

#s38
I bet he 's enjoyed having it that way

#s40
because some-

#s41
kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Well then most of them do n't have a three car garage

#s49
They 're kind of rare

#s51
Uh-huh

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
Well that

#s58
my we 've just got a two car garage

#s59
but my husband 's got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything

#s61
Now mine does not work on cars

#s62
he just piddles on this and that

#s64
But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his his piddling things

#s67
It really is

#s69
Because you know they have a lot of things of their own

#s70
and I you know I would n't mind having

#s71
and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff

#s73
but I someone

#s74
I do n't know

#s75
it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something

#s77
So I did n't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would

#s79
Uh-huh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s85
Uh-huh

#s86
Well I still

#s87
all three of my daughters are married

#s88
but I do n't know

#s89
I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time And some of them coming back home and things you know

#s92
And we 've got grandchildren now

#s93
so when they come they have to have a place

#s97
That 's right

#s98
you sure do n't

#s99
At times I keep thinking though that might be kind of nice

#s104
Uh-huh

#s106
Uh-huh

#s108
Uh-huh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
Well I do n't blame you for that

#s116
Well I have the three girls

#s117
and then we ended up with four grandsons

#s119
And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls

#s122
And uh I enjoy them coming but for short doses

#s124
It feels

#s125
after they 've been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house

#s126
they know everything

#s128
But they 're fun

#s130
Well I just watch them

#s132
I d- I never did put things up when my kids were little

#s133
and I have n't with them

#s134
I try to teach them not to get into things

#s137
I think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes

#s138
At least my daughters have

#s139
They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up

#s140
So it 's worked pretty well

#s141
There 's

#s142
I do n't really think anything 's been broken

#s143
Every now and then we have to kind of go and say now do n't bother this you know

#s145
But all in all they mind pretty well

#s146
But I guess most of the hou-

#s147
d-

#s148
what kind of roof does your house have

#s149
Here I 'm getting off the subject
