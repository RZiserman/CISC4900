Your family have reunions on a regular basis

#s4
Once every five years

#s6
Yeah

#s7
Uh you have got a pretty big family

#s11
Oh yeah

#s13
Yeah

#s14
we have a pretty big family

#s15
but most of us

#s16
well uh uh I am originally from West Virginia

#s18
Most of the family is right in the West Virginia uh uh what they call Tri-State area uh northern West Virginia eastern Ohio southwestern Pennsylvania

#s20
Most everybody is right in that area

#s23
Yeah

#s26
Yeah

#s27
They put one together for our family about once every June

#s28
It was on my grandmother 's birthday

#s29
but she is she is gone now

#s33

#s34
Uh

#s36
Oh

#s38
Pardon

#s40
Well no

#s41
There is kind of a set pattern to it

#s42
There is uh

#s43
so uh the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually

#s45
Yeah

#s46
Uh we uh get together at the uh the park uh the uh the park and playground area of the Church I was raised in

#s48
and uh everybody brings lots of food

#s49
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat

#s51
Oh gosh

#s53

#s55
Schedule vacation time

#s56

#s57
We usu-

#s58
uh Sat uh Sunday afternoon

#s59
or uh sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon

#s61
Usually it is like Sunday afternoon

#s62
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back

#s67
Well where I am calling from is southern Mississippi

#s68
So we have got uh uh my wife and I have uh a bit longer ways to go than most

#s70
uh actually we we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago One of the family reunions

#s72
But we are both in school

#s73
so that makes it kind of tough

#s75
They usually uh they have been happening uh just after the summer semester starts

#s77
Usually not

#s78
We managed to get to one

#s79
That was before I started school

#s80

#s81

#s107
Okay

#s108
