#s1
Okay

#s2
have you painted something lately

#s6
Yeah

#s8
Oh yeah

#s9
another bedroom

#s13
Yeah

#s14
Yeah

#s15
Yeah

#s18
Oh yeah

#s20
Oh heavens

#s21
Well I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom

#s23
But I get I have that problem with the the ceiling you know the uh the blown blown ceiling You know where you get around the edge

#s27
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s29
Well how do you get the edge though

#s31
The the straight edge

#s33
Oh I see

#s35
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s39
Huh

#s40
Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too

#s43
Oh really

#s47
Oh nice

#s49
Yeah

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Oh that will be nice

#s55
Huh

#s57
Or two tone or two tone You know

#s60
Uh-huh

#s62
White

#s64
But I have a problem

#s65
I ca n't get up high

#s66
and we ca n't paint the chimney

#s68
We have one of those ladders

#s69
We are just not willing to get up that high

#s75
Well we did too

#s76
We did it in the fall

#s77
and it it 's just too high

#s78
It is really scary

#s79
but and the only thing I would consider doing a professional maybe doing that

#s81
but it

#s82
other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional

#s85
Yeah

#s88
Uh-huh

#s90
Uh-huh

#s93
The blowers

#s96
Oh oh oh oh I know what you are talking about

#s97
Uh

#s98
scaffold

#s101
That 's it

#s104
Huh

#s106
It 's

#s107
Yeah

#s111
Oh my

#s112
So that was worth it getting a professional for that

#s115
Oh I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney

#s116
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself

#s118
It was n't too bad

#s119
I mean you think

#s121
Shoot maybe a hundred and fifty

#s123
Since it is a one story

#s124
but we did uh like two heavy coats over it

#s125
But then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it

#s128
Uh-huh

#s129
Uh-huh

#s130
Uh-huh

#s132
My word

#s135
Uh-huh

#s136
Uh-huh

#s137
Oh my word

#s139
Uh-huh

#s141
Uh-huh

#s143
Uh-huh

#s145
Oh my word

#s147
So that was really worth it Painting his own house

#s150
Oh my word

#s151
Oh my word

#s152
Well he really saved in that way

#s154
But yeah

#s155
I think we are going to do uh another bathroom

#s156
but I think I will probably just do it in a roller

#s157
I want to do it about the same color And just be a little

#s160
Oh I know

#s161
But it 's that it 's the textured wall
