#s3
Uh I guess I uh I like to play golf

#s5
And uh I also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts

#s8
Well we live uh pretty close to the Mesquite Golf Course

#s10
So we will play either out there or at Firewheel

#s11
That is usually where we play

#s12
but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area

#s15
Uh both

#s17
Not at the same time

#s19
No sometimes we ride

#s20
and sometimes uh we pull

#s21
we like to to uh a lot of the times just walk uh for the exercise

#s22
But

#s24
I find that when I ride in a cart I play better

#s25
and I think it is cause I do n't get as tired

#s27
Yeah

#s29
I know

#s30
and that makes me so mad

#s31
You know it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course

#s32
but apparently they think differently

#s34
Yeah

#s37
Right

#s39
Right

#s40
Well the reason why we play over there is because it 's where since we are a Garland resident they gave us a special deal where you can get uh ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars

#s41
yeah

#s42
a hundred dollars

#s43
cause it is half price what the normal green fees are

#s45
So that is why we you know play over there

#s46
cause we have got our card

#s49
Oh do you

#s50
So you live in Garland then

#s54
Okay

#s55
well we are in south Garland

#s56
but yeah next time you go uh you know check into it

#s57
they have uh

#s58
it is just like uh a bus card

#s59
and they just punch it You know

#s60
it has got one through ten on it

#s61
and every time you go they just punch it for you

#s63
Oh okay

#s65
You must have a a son

#s68
Oh okay

#s70
Yeah

#s72
Oh well that sounds like fun too

#s76
Uh-huh

#s77
Well you need to uh teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you

#s80
Oh yeah

#s81
Well you can teach them

#s85
Uh-huh

#s87
Right

#s88
Right

#s89
Uh-huh

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Right

#s94
Right

#s97
Right

#s98
Yeah

#s99
I know what you mean

#s101
Uh-huh

#s104
Oh yeah

#s105
It it is just nice to get outdoors and do something

#s108
Well flower gardens

#s109
I like to have

#s110
matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs

#s111
So those ought to be coming up around spring time

#s113
Uh-huh

#s115
Right

#s118
Oh they do great

#s119
I put mine in probably in November

#s121
Yeah

#s122
I think it was November

#s123
and I do n't do anything to mine water them or anything

#s124
And they just

#s125
they do really good

#s126
and I even had uh I guess it was last year or the year before I had some out

#s127
and it froze

#s128
and the pansies looked terrible

#s129
but they came back later

#s130
I did n't do anything to them

#s131
so they are uh they are good to plant in the winter time

#s132
They last for a long time then

#s133
So if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too

#s134
but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they ca n't stand the hot weather

#s138
No

#s139
they wo n't make it through the summer because it gets too hot

#s140
but they make it through probably winter and spring

#s141
So

#s143
Yeah

#s144
I have got some of those too

#s145
cause I love flowers

#s147
Yeah

#s148
And I do I try to do some arts and crafts

#s149
and I love to go
