#s3
Uh-huh

#s6
Oh that sounds good

#s8
Uh we 're not uh real wealthy at the moment

#s9
Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna

#s10
and I used my mother 's recipe

#s11
I really like it

#s12
It 's got um

#s13
you cook the noodles and make and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it

#s14
and I 'm not sure she even puts

#s15
must be some Italian spices in there

#s16
I ca n't remember

#s17
But um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and uh layer all that

#s19
It 's good

#s21
And then uh uh tossed salad and and um

#s22
Oh my goodness Diane get down from there

#s23
And uh let 's see

#s24
what else did I serve with that

#s26
Corn

#s27
yeah

#s28
I made French bread with that one too

#s30
I have a recipe that 's pretty good for that

#s31
So

#s33
Yeah

#s36
I 've heard that Sam 's has a really good lasagna

#s38
in fact I think I had it at a at a party once

#s40
It was good

#s43
Easy

#s45
Yeah

#s47
Yeah

#s49
Oh I know

#s51
Oh yeah

#s53
Not my favorite place but A necessity

#s59
Let 's see

#s60
what else do we like to have for

#s61
trying to think what else I like to serve

#s62
My mother likes to serve taco grandes

#s63
Have you ever had that

#s68
You take a flour tortilla

#s69
and you fry it like a taco shell

#s72
and you uh

#s73
for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um tomato sauce in it

#s74
and and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor

#s75
so you do n't have to mess with spices and stuff

#s77
And then um let 's see

#s78
and then and you heat up refried beans

#s79
and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese

#s80
and what you do to make it you take the shell

#s81
and you spread the beans on first

#s82
then you put the meat

#s83
then you put the grated cheese

#s84
and then you put um

#s85
let 's see

#s86
what 's next

#s87
then and I I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the um lettuce

#s89
and you can put uh like guacamole and

#s90
Katy I 'm on the phone

#s91
Well get a towel or go change

#s92
I 'm on the phone

#s93
Um oh a little sour cream is good and and chopped olives

#s97
Uh yeah

#s101
No

#s102
I do n't very often

#s103
Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain

#s105
so Yeah

#s107
I just cut slices off

#s108
and I like an avocado sandwich too

#s113
Yeah

#s114
yeah

#s117
What you want

#s118
where do they get it

#s121
I ca n't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to

#s122
I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe

#s126
Yeah

#s128
It helps if you I helps if you leave the pit in it

#s130
Yeah

#s131
if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you 're waiting before you serve it

#s134
That 's supposed to help keep the um keep it from turning brown so quick

#s138
Oh

#s140
Oh that 's good

#s142
That probably helps too

#s148
Do you want it

#s150
Oh yeah

#s151
we have too

#s155
Do you want scrambled

#s158
Yeah

#s159
Yeah

#s161
if you get it on sale

#s167
Yeah

#s168
yeah

#s170
I do n't think mine know either

#s171
In fact we 've been getting lunch meat that 's turkey too

#s172
It costs less than the other

#s173
I do n't know

#s174
there 's supposed to be something more healthy about it

#s177
Poultry instead of the beef and pork

#s179
yeah

#s183
Yeah

#s184
I I ca n't think of any other specific things I like to serve

#s185
Um

#s187
One salad that we always like my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a

#s188
I do n't know what you call it

#s189
Uh you mix um cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of uh like Cool Whip

#s192
that 's good and quick and easy

#s196
Uh-huh
