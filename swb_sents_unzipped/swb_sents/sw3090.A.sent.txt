#s1
Okay uh

#s2
well do you uh keep a family budget

#s3
or do you have some

#s7
Uh-huh

#s11
Oh interesting

#s12
Yes

#s13
well uh we sort of started doing it years and years ago

#s14
and my husband started graduate school when we were first married

#s15
and I sort of just got in the habit I guess And you know never have gotten out of it

#s16
I can not really say that it 's a formal budget

#s17
it 's more just a a pretty uh a fairly uh accurate uh recording of what I spend and what I think I am going to have to spend

#s19
And uh

#s21
Yeah

#s24
Yeah

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Right

#s28
Yeah

#s30
That sounds real similar

#s33
Um

#s35
Oh my

#s36
yeah

#s39
Yeah

#s40
Sure

#s42
Yeah

#s43
I think you are right um uh

#s44
well i- it must have been sort of interesting to us

#s45
is to uh it 's because

#s46
since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years I guess I can go back and look

#s47
and it 's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years Uh

#s50
For instance

#s54
My goodness

#s57
Oh dear

#s58
Yes

#s60
Oh yes

#s62
Well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things not lon- not long ago I guess it has been a couple of years in an old trunk that she had

#s63
And she came upon a a budget book that she had back in the thirties Uh when they

#s65
it was the late well

#s66
I guess it would have been I will take that back it must have been in the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time

#s67
And it was just uh fascinating to see how little things cost

#s68
I mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know

#s70
of course it 's all relative of course

#s73
but uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know

#s74
for a pr- pair of shoes was like five dollars

#s75
and

#s79
Um

#s81
Oh

#s83
Oh is n't that something

#s86
Really

#s87
Oh that is that is really really something

#s89
That 's true

#s91
Yeah

#s93
that 's that 's right

#s94
That 's exa- that 's just good old economics working

#s97
Well uh we have tried to uh instill some some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids

#s98
but our two children are just uh as um unlike as night and day

#s99
And our son could care less about a budget

#s101
and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost she almost just sounds like your father

#s102
I mean she has everything planned so closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop

#s109
Yes

#s110
Right

#s111
yes

#s113
Yes

#s116
Yeah

#s118
I think that is true

#s119
I uh

#s120
and I think that is probably what happened in our house

#s122
because I think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married

#s123
and I was I was really diligent about that

#s124
I was putting money aside and when before I was married you know when I was working out of college

#s125
and uh that really paid off

#s127
Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts

#s128
And

#s131
Yeah

#s133
MUMBLEx

#s135
Uh he is an engineer

#s136
he is uh an electrical engineer And in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his P H D

#s138
so we had a lot of lot of years of budgeting

#s142
And you know

#s143
Yeah

#s144
When you

#s146
uh yes

#s148
Well I 'm working I 'm working on my master 's degree now

#s150
so in fact this last year we had three

#s151
both of the children were in college

#s152
our son has a year left

#s153
and our daughter graduated this year

#s154
and I 'm just about ready to finish my master 's degree

#s156
so we have had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us

#s159
But uh

#s161
Yeah

#s163
Yeah

#s164
yeah

#s165
you know exactly what it what it 's like then

#s168
And it 's uh

#s169
which you learn

#s170
I guess you figure that that is an investment that is uh really a in- invaluable

#s172
Uh-huh

#s175
Yeah

#s176
That is right

#s177
so it 's it 's one that you can live through

#s178
And I think that that 's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel You know that that it was worth it to save and to not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it

#s181
so uh it really makes it easier

#s184
but uh well I have enjoyed talking with you Jerry

#s186
And I I wish I could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me

#s187
I am interested in that

#s191
Oh

#s194
Oh wow

#s195
Well my my husband and I just went there last year

#s196
um actually we did not take a tour

#s197
we we were in England and and uh went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and did it on our own

#s199
but uh um I

#s200
that sounds interesting

#s201
Is your business in Dallas then

#s204
Okay

#s209
Oh you are kidding

#s211
