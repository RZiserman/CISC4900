#s3
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh baseball

#s8
Well I 've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers uh more so with uh uh their management than anything else

#s9
I I do n't follow baseball that that closely

#s10
but uh you know since I live here so close to Arlington uh that 's the team that I 've been kind of following

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Right

#s18
Well I think that uh you know with uh so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it 's um you know

#s19
I think

#s20
I 'm not real sure about th-

#s21
do you know anything about Ruben Sierra 's uh

#s23
Yeah

#s24
that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit

#s25
Yeah

#s29
but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil- that 's a lot of money

#s33
Yeah

#s34
they are

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
And I really think I really think that uh that they ought to

#s39
I 'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money

#s40
I think they should uh uh pay him what his salary is going to be uh and let him

#s41
because he 's got one more year before he turns into a free agent

#s43
And then uh who knows

#s44
if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway

#s45
but if he does n't then his market value will go down

#s46
and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the si- you know the six million dollars a year this year

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
Oh yeah

#s52
but you know what he

#s53
that was a great deal for him

#s55
Yeah

#s56
it was a great deal for him

#s57
and and uh he just signed on uh

#s58
I think it was like a five year deal with uh Pittsburgh

#s61
So you know he 's real happy there

#s62
As far as the Rangers are concerned I think I think they need some definitely need some pitching

#s64
Uh and so I you know I

#s66
The pitching coach

#s68
Well you know I was just looking at the news tonight

#s69
and they showed a a a black guy that was go- was helping out uh His assistant

#s72
And I think that 's a a great addition

#s73
I mean he seemed to know what he was doing

#s74
and and uh

#s76
Oh you do n't like Howse huh

#s83
Oh Tom Grieve

#s85
Yeah

#s86
I 'm I 'm not sure that um that they 're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet

#s87
but Howse might be a different uh situation

#s88
and I think you 're probably right that they that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe

#s89
and um

#s92
You do huh

#s94
That 's contrary to uh popular belief you know

#s98
Oh I know

#s99
You know it 's too bad that uh it has to be a forty-two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know

#s101
They need to have some some young guys that can take the lead

#s102
and and

#s103
uh Yeah
