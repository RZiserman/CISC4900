#s1
Okay

#s3
Well I think it 's it 's probably a combination of things

#s4
Um factories that that burn coal as a an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants you know

#s5
and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides

#s7
Uh those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain

#s8
and I think that 's that 's probably hurting us a little bit

#s9
It 's hurting you know it 's hurting Germany for example too and some other parts of Europe where they where they have high industry

#s10
So we 're not the lone ranger here

#s14
Yeah

#s15
Hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit

#s16
but I know we have n't cured it yet by a long shot

#s18
Yeah

#s23
Yeah

#s24
Huh

#s25
Yeah

#s26
I guess I missed that one

#s27
Uh

#s29
Automobiles of course are contributing too

#s30
and you know how how we are with our love affair with the auto

#s32
kind of hard to do anything about that I guess

#s37
Yeah

#s39
We have that here too

#s40
but it 's part of the inspection sticker you know

#s41
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe

#s42
and and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out

#s43
and so that 's you know that 's the way they 're dealing with it here

#s50
Yeah

#s52
Yeah

#s53
It 'd probably be difficult anyway

#s57
I was just reading an article in uh MOTHER EARTH NEWS MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine

#s59
and uh they 've got a new uh

#s60
you know a lot of places are burning wood

#s62
a lot a lot of people are burning wood

#s63
those of us who have

#s64
I 've got a place in the country you know

#s66
and uh they 've had catalytic con- you know catalytic converters on those on

#s67
uh I think they 're required in California and Oregon and and Washington

#s68
but they 've had up those for quite a while

#s69
and somebody 's come up with a new one that uh sort of

#s70
it 's a it 's a catalytic converter

#s71
it 's it 's a plate that fits in you know into the smoke pipe

#s73
and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself

#s74
The more smoke is produced you know

#s75
after you get to like five hundred degrees the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is

#s76
And it sounds real neat

#s77
I have n't seen them priced anywhere yet

#s78
but that that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know old old uh older stoves that do n't have any kind of E P A requirements on them

#s80
That might help a little bit especially in some places

#s81
We 're really lucky here

#s82
We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out

#s84
Now sometimes we get a kind of a

#s85
especially in in uh autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us

#s86
but most of the time it 's blowing out pretty well

#s88
Probably blowing up there to you guys

#s94
Yeah

#s95
It comes back

#s96
Yeah

#s97
I really think uh you know we 're doing some some important things

#s98
Education raising consciousness awareness

#s99
uh I know school kids

#s100
I work for the school district here

#s101
and uh you know this is one of the big things with kids

#s102
Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know telling adults to clean up their act

#s104
and it 's uh you know

#s105
I hope we 're not too late with it

#s106
We 're we 're uh we 're having all kinds of recycling
