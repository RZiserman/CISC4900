#s1
We 're set

#s3
What changes do you feel have happened

#s7
Right

#s8
Increases each year does n't it

#s10
It increases each year I think

#s14
Well and I think women have kind of had uh in the past the real subservient role

#s17
And uh

#s19
Well we do to some degree

#s21
but uh uh I think it 's not as much as it was

#s26
I And especially I think with women increasingly working they 're going to have to demand more from men

#s28
Because there is just i- impossible to keep up on everything else

#s31
Have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home

#s36
Right

#s38
Well you know there is a lot of companies that wo n't give mat- women maternity leave for that very reason

#s40
Uh in fact I know the school districts down here you they do n't have maternity leave

#s41
Uh you simply have to take accumulate your sick leave And take your sick leave

#s45
And I do n't know uh if bigger company companies do

#s46
but when I was employed with the school district I did n't have maternity leave either

#s47
and that was the reason

#s48
because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men

#s49
but So uh

#s52
Yeah

#s53
it is

#s55
You have to save all of your uh vacation time

#s56
You do

#s57
You have to save all your vacation time

#s58
and that 's usually how it 's uh happened

#s60
but uh

#s62
What do you see uh changing in the future

#s64
Right

#s65
and and top level

#s68
Maybe top level

#s75
That would be kind of nice

#s77
That 's right

#s78
that 's right

#s82
Yeah

#s83
I think that 's probably good

#s84
A little more integration

#s86
And uh maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners

#s87
and

#s90
I think

#s94
Right

#s96
Right

#s98
No

#s99
I do n't either

#s100
I do n't think they 're ever going to prove that men and women are equal

#s102
We just function differently

#s105
And uh I 'm not capable of lifting what uh a man can lift and you know that type of that type of thing

#s107
but uh one of the big changes uh they 're doing in Salt Lake is uh

#s109
and they 're probably

#s110
I 'm sure in Dallas since you 're big places a lot more women are uh working right out of their home with their P C 's or with their lap computers or whatever

#s115
I think that

#s118
Right

#s121
Right

#s122
You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week

#s123
and

#s125
Course they 're talking about uh that we 're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that

#s128
so uh it would be kind of exciting in some ways to to see a little bit more of that

#s129
and some ways it might be kind of scary

#s131
Think anybody could do it

#s132
but Anyway

#s136
Right

#s137
Right

#s138
but then you know there is the process of selection

#s139
Would you have to give them the brand

#s141
and uh You know when you shop you usually compare the prices

#s143
and

#s144
would be nice though
