#s6
No

#s7
I did n't

#s8
I uh have been at my computer all day

#s9
so

#s12
Well I used to be a real big Cowboy fan

#s13
and and uh I 'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan

#s14
Being an Okie I just really do n't care much uh

#s17
it 's it 's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan though

#s19
They 've always been you know my favorite

#s21
But uh and and I guess I still have a soft spot

#s23
I just hate that that 's the coach that 's leading them

#s26
So now have they

#s27
they 're in the playoffs right

#s37
I 'll bet they are

#s44
Uh football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world

#s46
Hit a bad season and it 's you know the coach 's fault

#s47
let 's let 's dump him

#s49
First good season the coach can do no wrong

#s52
But they Dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and both running running backs and and defense

#s63
is the competition going to be

#s78
Course I think you know you ca n't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that heal

#s81
and you know it can be a tot- or injuries that uh have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played

#s89
But but since you have an O U drop out as a quarterback

#s95
Well Well he he really did n't feel like he 'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U

#s97
O U has always been known for their running game

#s99
More than

#s101
Right

#s104
Oh I tell you

#s105
they 've they 've not had much of a team this year

#s106
bless their little hearts

#s109
Are they

#s111
I have n't been watching

#s114
Well good for us

#s117
Oh

#s122
Yeah

#s123
they h-

#s124
then he went out to S to southern Cal

#s125
Is that where he went

#s128
Yeah

#s130
So
