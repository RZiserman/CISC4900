How do you feel about the Viet Nam war

#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Yeah

#s7
I saw that as well

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Well were you ever in Viet Nam

#s17
or

#s23
Um I was much too young

#s24
I was born in sixty-seven

#s25
so

#s27
Um you know both my well both my brothers were um draft age

#s28
but neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Yeah

#s34
Uh-huh

#s37
Well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there

#s40
Okay

#s44
Um do you think I mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it

#s47
I totally agree with that

#s48
Um

#s50
What what effects do you think it 's had on our country

#s54
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
I think MUMBLEx you know that 's pretty typical that of the entire entire involvement over that you know that nothing was really addressed

#s59
it was- it was n't you know it was never

#s60
we we announced that we were going to war

#s61
it was such a gradual and subtle you know thi- um you know increasement of of force that

#s66
I vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something

#s71
Oh

#s73
Uh-huh Um

#s74
so um do do do you think that like uh um for example like in in this past war in the Persian Gulf war that uh that

#s75
you see it seemed to me that that Bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um you know prepare the country for war

#s78
Yeah

#s79
Okay

#s83
Uh I was n't really keeping count

#s84
But I guess

#s85
good-bye

#s89
Bye
