Um short term I do n't think anything 's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it

#s6
Uh the short term the recession is getting getting top attention

#s10
And that effectively adds to whether it 's officially on the books or not

#s14
And that 's got to be paid

#s18
It can only hurt the deficit picture

#s21
Um and the the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term

#s24
So that that that 's the current predicament

#s34
Yeah

#s35
I 'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point

#s36
It 's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is

#s39
Well well first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates

#s44
Well at the moment we 're doing very well on inflation

#s47
That 's the sort of upside to the deficit

#s49
That 's the upside to the recession

#s53
MUMBLEx Well can be done or will be done are two different things

#s54
Um at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation

#s56
But there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed

#s57
Uh a lot of entitlement programs like education aid I think uh they should put a in

#s58
the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class uh

#s60
in the longer term uh we we we 'd do well I think to make to make uh reductions there

#s61
Also somewhat MUMBLEx is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed

#s66
A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which are sort of not colleges

#s68
but schools that teach you trades you know beautician well and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition uh and the school gets paid off immediately uh

#s71
and then they do n't provide very much education

#s72
Yes

#s76
Yeah
