Not very good

#s2
it 's not been a good day

#s4
I do n't know

#s5
I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn

#s6
so I hope she 's turned it in

#s8
Uh I ju-

#s9
go ahead

#s10
I 'll stop eating

#s11
I just barely got home from the university

#s14
I just barely got home from the university

#s17
Okay

#s18
go ahead

#s19
fire away

#s23
I agree with you

#s26
Huh

#s30
I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax

#s31
But on the other hand I do n't mind that it 's only on you know things that are n't like groceries and that

#s32
it 's not on that

#s34
Oh yeah

#s35
they do

#s37
In Arizona

#s39
Uh-huh

#s40
But we have a pretty low income ta- I mean pretty low tax rate here

#s41
Oh I think the the sales tax they just got to do something about it

#s43
But that 's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes

#s48
Well and I still think that having lived in Europe for awhile you know difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it

#s52
Well I mean I think

#s53
I was in Germany you know for several years

#s55
and I 'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there

#s58
Higher taxes

#s59
Yeah

#s64
Still 's that way to some extent

#s66
I think the other problem is you know it it 's easy to complain about taxes because there 's something you theoretically can do something about

#s68
But I look for example

#s69
and you 're not quite in the same situation

#s70
but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world

#s72
I wish I did n't have to pay any more fo- to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes

#s77
Yeah

#s78
that that 's probably a little tougher on you

#s91
No

#s92
I think that 's just you though

#s97
Yeah

#s102
Of course I think with the graying of America we 're going to see that problem in lots of places

#s107
Or build roads
