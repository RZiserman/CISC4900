How are you

#s3
You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget

#s16
That sounds kind of like me

#s20
About the same thing

#s22
Yeah

#s25
I 'm even in worse shape because I have eight children

#s26
and uh we live from hand to mouth

#s27
We hope that there 's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills

#s28
and if there 's not then we MUMBLEx due for the next month

#s30
A couple of times we 've tried some things

#s31
and they worked

#s32
but I 'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it

#s34
The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope

#s36
and when the envelope was empty then you did n't have any more money to spend in that area

#s38
And that worked out real well cause we did n't have to keep writing down what we 'd spent

#s40
It was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money

#s41
And we did that pretty successfully for about three months

#s42
and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope

#s43
and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do

#s60
Uh-huh

#s61
Uh-huh

#s65
I even find now like with the automatic tellers I 'll go take money out of that

#s67
and then I forget to take that out of my checking account

#s69
And uh

#s71
So I I I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account

#s72
and I figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what 's really there

#s74
And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make

#s89
Yeah

#s93
But it was still running

#s100
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s110
Not very often

#s113
That 's right

#s115
lot of
