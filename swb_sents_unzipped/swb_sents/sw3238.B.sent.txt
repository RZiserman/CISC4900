Hello

#s4
Hi

#s7
I 'm Sandy

#s8
I 'm in Texas too

#s11
Oh really

#s15
Yes

#s18
Yeah

#s21
Okay

#s26
Yeah

#s31
So am I

#s33
You know I think it 's kind of coming back around to that do n't you

#s34
I mean that there 's a lot more people that stay home now than before

#s35
but I guess more than anything I think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know

#s37
I do n't know

#s38
I mean I think sometimes some of the the women 's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know

#s39
and you ca n't have everything

#s41
I do n't I do n't think that you can have I mean there 's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be

#s43
and to me that 's more important

#s45
Two

#s47
Uh-huh

#s50
Five and two

#s64
Well I agree

#s65
I mean but I I hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children are n't going to you know turn out or whatever because that 's not fair to you know like the single moms that have to work

#s67
or if they would n't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever

#s69
I mean I think it 's got to be a personal choice

#s70
and it 's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home

#s81
Yeah

#s84
Yeah

#s95
Yeah

#s96
Well and I think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff

#s97
and I think that 's really important that that they do that

#s99
and they realize there 's a need for that

#s100
and um I do n't know

#s101
I found when I did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work

#s102
and it was n't where I had to be there every day

#s103
but I mean we were going to the doctor once a week

#s104
so I do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
