#s1
Well we 've talked a little bit about the Plano school system

#s2
Um I I really have been pleased with Plano

#s3
I have a child who uh

#s4
my son is learning disabled

#s6
and uh I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into

#s8
He 's in elementary school

#s10
And he 's not severely learning disabled

#s12
I mean you know he just He 's being helped

#s14
He he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math

#s16
and they recently released him from resource which I 'm I was thrilled

#s18
I really was

#s19
I I just thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump

#s20
And um he 's in the Herman Method of Reading

#s21
I do n't know if you 're familiar with that

#s25
It is something new

#s26
and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters

#s28
Um

#s30
It 's wonderful

#s32
Yes

#s33
and it 's wonderful

#s34
He did n't have a problem with reading

#s35
As a matter of fact he 's reading on level

#s36
The problem was his spelling

#s37
And you know in in watching the way he has struggled

#s39
it 's interesting because I 'm convinced I have the same learning disability or had that was ignored

#s41
And

#s44
That 's right

#s45
And and so it 's you know it 's not an intelligence problem

#s46
It 's just a problem with learning

#s50
Well you know it 's funny

#s51
When um when he was in first grade he had trouble with with spelling

#s53
and I would say to the teacher

#s54
you know it 's amazing

#s55
He will be able to

#s56
you 'll say to him spell cat

#s57
and you know he 'll say C A T

#s58
and then he would go to write it

#s59
and he would write C O T

#s61
And I kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here

#s62
Something is wrong here

#s64
And the teacher kept saying oh he has a May birthday

#s65
He 's just immature

#s67
Well second grade it was

#s68
I will

#s69
these teachers as far as I 'm concerned are absolute saints because in second grade it was about the second week of school I went up there

#s70
and I I requested a conference and because all year long they kept telling me I was crazy

#s74
Well I was

#s75
and I and I went up there the second week of school

#s76
and I said you know something is wrong

#s77
and thank God the li- the head teacher the team leader was a special education major

#s79
It was it was

#s80
and She had picked it up

#s82
yep

#s84
she had already picked it up

#s85
And she said you know we we were going to call you if you had n't called us

#s86
We think there 's a learning disability

#s87
and we think he needs to be tested immediately because you know once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested

#s89
and she said I think we can get him real fast

#s92
And sure enough they tested him

#s93
and you know he qualified for for the help

#s94
and it 's been great

#s95
and I and I thank God I 'm here because I I know I have a sister who has the other extreme

#s96
She has a a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted

#s97
and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her

#s100
And and to me that 's the same thing

#s101
It 's it 's like having a child who has a learning disability that 's being ignored

#s102
this poor gifted child is being ignored

#s107
That 's true

#s109
That 's true

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
Yes

#s115
Right

#s116
Right

#s119
Exactly

#s120
and They do n't take them

#s122
that 's right

#s125
Right

#s126
Uh-huh

#s130
Uh-huh

#s134
Really

#s135
really

#s138
Yeah

#s140
Well when comparing test scores

#s141
I know recently I was in a discussion

#s142
and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools

#s144
and that was one of the points that I made is that you 're not comparing apples to apples

#s146
You know you ca n't say um you know

#s147
I know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and into a private school And um which is which is too bad

#s149
But on the other hand I I ca n't necessarily blame them you know

#s150
they they are a private school

#s152
and they can do whatever they want

#s156
And they ca- they

#s157
that 's right

#s158
they have the ability to be selective

#s159
But you ca n't say then well public schools are are not as good

#s161
Perhaps they are because they 're they 're

#s163
You 're right

#s166
Oh really

#s170
Uh-huh

#s172
Uh-huh

#s175
Uh-huh

#s176
uh-huh

#s179
Yeah

#s181
Right

#s182
well you see that with the foreigners that come here

#s184
Um I I was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they where they said that you know these children they they had to be the best

#s185
and they put off all social life all everything you know

#s188
Well is that good

#s189
Yes

#s190
the child is very bright

#s191
but on the other hand I feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road have are more rounded you know

#s194
Sure

#s195
sure

#s196
I think it 's real important to have friends

#s197
I think it 's real important to play sports

#s198
I think it 's real important to be part of a team

#s200
And so that 's why I said their childhood is extremely different from mine

#s201
We did n't do all that you know

#s203
We certainly did n't carpool and run the way I do

#s204
Um

#s206
No

#s207
Right

#s208
right

#s212
Uh-huh
