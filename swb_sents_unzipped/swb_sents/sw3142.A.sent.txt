#s5
Uh-huh

#s8
Yes

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Do you usually go out uh with the children or without them

#s17
Right

#s19
Yes

#s25
Yes

#s26
Yes

#s28
Well

#s31
Uh well uh we do n't have any children

#s32
so uh we tend to like to try all sorts of different things

#s33
And uh we 're very attracted to exotic food

#s35
And uh we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and uh sort of gourmet Mexican and uh things like that as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and uh Chinese and things and and things of that sort

#s36
Now yes

#s37
of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too

#s39
And uh we probably go out one to two times a week

#s41
And uh uh we 're pretty much regulars at an Italian local Italian restaurant

#s43
Momo 's

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
I 've heard about it

#s52
I have n't been in there

#s56
Uh-huh

#s58
Tha- that 's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me

#s59
I I like different kinds of food

#s60
So when we go out I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it 's a Mexican Restaurant like something other than uh you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas now

#s62
Yes

#s63
yes

#s64
and once in a while things backfire

#s65
I mean we 've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that

#s67
And I 'm not fond of some of those things

#s68
but we 'll try we 'll try anything

#s70
Ethiopian we 've had Ethiopian

#s71
And uh not in Plano of course

#s74
But we really we really do enjoy going out

#s75
and uh and um I 'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires

#s77
Yeah

#s78
I think we 're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant

#s79
How do you usually find a a new restaurant

#s85
Uh-huh

#s86
So do we

#s88
Uh-huh

#s91
Right

#s93
Uh-huh

#s94
We have found uh a number of restaurants either through D and the Friday paper and sometimes the the OBSERVER Which my husband usually picks up And also through coupons

#s96
When a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons

#s98
And you know when they say you know buy one get one free It 's hard to resist

#s99
so we 'll go in

#s100
And very often we 'll find a place that we like

#s101
and we 'll stick with it

#s102
once they give they no longer give coupons We 'll we 'll uh we 'll stay there

#s105
But we 've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the through the newspaper reviews

#s110
I mean it 's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you 've got say four or something like that

#s111
It 's very expensive to go out to eat

#s114
So yeah

#s115
that that is really one of our

#s116
it 's almost a hobby with us

#s119
Yes

#s121
Yes

#s123
Yeah

#s124
Uh-huh

#s125
Oh absolutely

#s126
And do the dishes

#s133
Oh yes

#s136
M- m- m- my sister who also lives here in Dallas uh tends to uh chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty

#s139
but

#s141
What 's your favorite restaurant

#s143
Uh-huh

#s145
Sure

#s147
You know we 've never been there

#s149
And that 's supposed to be wonderful

#s150
Um

#s152
Uh-huh

#s158
Ooh

#s163
Uh-huh

#s166
I would probably like that

#s167
One or two times in my life I 've ever had venison I 've loved it

#s168
But you know just it 's just not

#s169
I do n't know people who hunt

#s170
so

#s171
uh

#s173
That 's that 's supposed to be a wonderful place

#s174
W- uh uh uh here in Plano well we tend to go to Momo 's a l- fairly often

#s175
And uh sometimes we 'll go you know

#s176
we we also go to Chili 's and uh Colter 's Bar B Q

#s177
and and uh we go to lil- there is a little Thai place that 's over on Park that we go to

#s178
My husband particularly likes that

#s179
We go into Dallas a lot and because we 're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently

#s180
And uh we 'll go down to uh Blue Mesa Grill Mexican food

#s181
and
