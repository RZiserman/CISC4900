#s33
You get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry

#s35
and it just gets so dry

#s36
and the earth opens up

#s37
I can remember the first year I moved here

#s39
and it did n't rain

#s40
I moved here like in late August

#s41
and it did n't rain from August until December

#s42
and I went home and told it just does n't rain in Texas

#s43
I mean it was great after growing up in Michigan

#s44
and not and al- you know every day was cloudy

#s45
almost every day was cloudy

#s46
and I you sort of forget how much it did rain

#s47

Lake I think Lake Whitmore is the only one I have real memories of Which is

#s121
Um

#s122
well I think it 's I think it 's toward Ann Arbor

#s123
so it 's probably out in that direction

#s124
but that 's the only one I probably could name after all these years

#s125
Uh-huh

#s126

#s160
so those are always fun

#s161
And Alpine

#s162

#s163
Uh-huh

#s166
uh-huh

#s167
I always tell people that in the winter we use we used to uh

#s168
my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on you know make a pond in the backyard for us

#s171
So but uh you know we probably did some ice skating on it

#s172
but then it chipped chipped

#s173
and you know it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven

#s181
Yeah

#s183
Oh

#s185
Oh

#s186
Oh right

#s187

#s206
I know

#s208

#s210
so uh I I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets

#s211
so But uh well we have

#s212
our house is kind of on a little hill

#s213
so uh we get the sled out

#s214
and uh the kids go down the hi- the hill on the sleds when it 's icy

#s215
I mean they just go down the ice

#s216
Yeah

#s217
And if it 's cold we say okay out you go

#s218
I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there
