#s1
Well anyway I uh I uh oh

#s2
yeah

#s3
I did forget to ask you

#s4
What is your name by the way

#s6
Oh you 're Ann

#s7
Hi

#s8
But uh anyway I uh

#s9
lot of lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good be a good change if we 're going to be talking about the subject t- tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the

#s12
Yeah

#s13
Th- the one of which was uh something something that 's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town

#s14
and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race Uh

#s16
Yeah

#s17
Well they they uh the the people that

#s18
the uh the jury that 's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel

#s20
And there 's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact

#s24
They have

#s25
They have

#s26
They moved it up to the county north of here

#s28
Um it 's in Ventura

#s29
and there 's there 's still quite a bit of publicity obviously

#s30
and it 's kind of it 's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that

#s32
Yeah

#s33
It was everywhere

#s35
So you know

#s36
and I I think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on

#s39
Exactly

#s40
You know um the you know

#s41
I I 'm kind of torn on this issue

#s42
It 's like they 're saying well on the one hand they 're not he 's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true

#s43
But on the other hand it 's it 's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict

#s45
Uh you know they 're not going to do their job Which is

#s46
the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there 's enough

#s53
Um

#s56
They

#s57
well I guess it depends on who you talk to

#s58
I have n't talked to uh I have n't talked to a whole lot of black people on it

#s59
but I I rather imagine there 's there 's some snickering about it And a lot of the usually fatalistic uh here we go again folks kind of stuff

#s63
No

#s64
no

#s65
I you know

#s66
on on on one hand you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it 's sm- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy

#s67
Um

#s71
Uh-huh

#s73
Well

#s75
Yeah

#s76
Um

#s80
I do n't know You know

#s81
and and again there 's something else tha- you know there was a uh something else along those lines

#s82
There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins

#s83
I do n't know if it 's it 's got it 's got as much notoriety

#s84
but it 's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the Rodney King problem

#s85
Um a girl walked into a Korean owned store

#s86
and uh they she had a dispute black girl

#s88
She she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store

#s89
The owner of the store popped her

#s91
Yeah

#s92
And and oh of course they you know

#s93
the criminal case went up

#s94
and and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh uh practically a suspended sentence

#s95
I mean it was it was just

#s97
she gave her no time in jail you know all of these things

#s98
and then oh there 's we have these we have people wondering around to- with petitions trying to get the judge

#s100
Yeah

#s101
Yeah

#s104
Yeah

#s105
It would make it would make life easier

#s107
Yeah

#s109
But
