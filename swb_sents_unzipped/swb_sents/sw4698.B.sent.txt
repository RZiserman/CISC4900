#s3
Oh yeah

#s5
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
Well I 've I 'm currently in school

#s11
so I I 've had an I B M clone I guess for a couple of years now which I 've been trying continually upgrading I guess

#s12
And uh I 've found I 've found that I pretty much become addicted to it

#s13
and I ca n't really

#s14
I 've found that most of homework assignments MUMBLEx really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis

#s15
so

#s17
it it 's pr- very essential for me

#s18
Schools have them

#s19
uh but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school

#s20
It 's very easy it 's much more convenient to have one at home

#s22
At Georgia Tech

#s24
Yeah

#s25
so

#s27
Yes actually

#s29
Yeah

#s30
it uh

#s32
Um sure

#s33
I have some games of course which I play on there

#s34
and uh uh I have a program which allows me to access a uh weather data bank

#s35
so I can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby

#s36
So it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on

#s37
so Have you do you have a computer for yourself at home

#s42
Oh yeah

#s43
Yeah

#s44
Tha-

#s49
Uh-huh

#s50
Yeah

#s51
yeah

#s52
Do you use Email and like that

#s55
Yeah

#s56
It 's

#s57
I I uh I have modem MUMBLEx night computer

#s58
so I can log into the sys- the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful

#s59
But uh yeah

#s60
that 's that and word processing is

#s61
while I tend to

#s62
I mean obviously I do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it 's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments

#s64
So it 's it 's really become I do n't know really become my mainstay I guess

#s65
I ca n't even remember

#s66
actually I do n't think I 've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a a to do a report Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer T R S Eighty when they first came out

#s68
And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high

#s69
so

#s73
Oh yeah

#s75
Oh

#s77
Yeah

#s78
It must have been tough

#s79
It 's a little bit strange for me

#s80
I I did my Master 's thesis uh last year

#s81
and I did that on a computer

#s82
and it seems like

#s83
I just ca n't imagine how people did it before

#s84
It must have been just so much so much work

#s87
Yeah

#s88
So uh MUMBLEx so yo- you used your son 's Macintosh then

#s89
Do you do you find it do you like that kind of computer

#s96
Uh-huh

#s98
Yeah

#s99
Huh

#s102
Yeah

#s107
Yeah

#s108
Well i- if if if the interface is there so that it 's like fun to use and the challenge
