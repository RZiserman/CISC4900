#s2
Uh

#s4
Oh God no

#s5
Uh no

#s6
I 'm not

#s7
I have n't been

#s8
I grew up in Dallas

#s9
but I 'm still not a Cowboys ' man

#s10
I like Philadelphia Eagles

#s12
Yeah

#s14
That 's my favorite team

#s15
so

#s16
Uh now that Randall 's coming back next season I hope they 'll be do a little bit better

#s17
They did n't do too bad last season

#s19
But I hope they can do better

#s20
How about yourself

#s24
Uh-huh

#s26
Oh

#s28
Yeah

#s29
That 's another one of my favorites

#s32
They 're not they 're not my favorite totally

#s33
But I do like them

#s34
I like

#s35
yeah

#s37
Seahawks are good

#s38
They

#s39
now that Steve Largent is gone I kind of lose a little bit for them

#s40
but you know he

#s43
Really

#s45
Huh

#s48
Yeah

#s49
That 's kind of that 's kind of strange

#s50
It 's too much running for me in in college football

#s51
I like I like the pros

#s53
They do you know

#s54
it 's more high tech

#s55
more you know players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when it 's a job and not just you know

#s59
when you 're getting paid millions to do it you ac- I think they take it to another level

#s61
But I can see it 's more you know grunted out run the ball type

#s62
College football is a little bit different

#s63
but

#s66
Who- who 's that

#s67
Notre Dame

#s70
N- Nebraska

#s71
Yeah

#s72
there 's a running team

#s74
Yeah

#s75
That that that 's boring for me

#s76
I I 'll take the passing teams any day

#s78
But

#s82
Yeah

#s83
It 's just it 's four yards three yards eight yards tackle

#s85
That 's you know it gets kind of monotonous

#s86
After awhile I I prefer forty a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit

#s88
and but

#s91
Yeah

#s92
It 's high dollar

#s93
You know it 's all it 's all money now

#s94
Even college is all can we get on T V

#s96
so

#s98
That 's that 's

#s102
Right

#s103
Yeah

#s106
Uh not really

#s107
I I do n't think anything will ever take over the N F L

#s108
I think it 's basically you know it 's it 's an institution

#s110
It 's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball

#s111
It 's just I just you know

#s113
I mean it it it can be it can take over part of it

#s114
But it 's never going to be the next

#s118
Yeah

#s119
MUMBLEx it 's going to take a little bit

#s120
Some people are going to watch it

#s121
but it 's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything you know

#s123
It 's just it 's never going to reach that that standard

#s124
but

#s129
Yeah

#s130
yeah

#s131
It 's kind of it 's kind of strange

#s132
Uh I guess we 're the only ones who take it that far

#s133
Everybody else still nuts over soccer

#s134
but

#s138
Yeah

#s143
Yeah

#s144
or Australian rules football

#s145
That 's

#s148
Yeah

#s149
That 's some brutal stuff there

#s150
That 's that 's worse than football as far as violence I think

#s151
Golly

#s152
Those guys kill each other out there

#s153
Rugby is something else

#s157
Yeah

#s158
That 's just wild

#s159
That 's why it 's a go- a big college thing

#s161
Rugby is definitely big in college because it 's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do

#s166
So yeah

#s167
I could see the feel for that

#s168
But it 's it 's pretty it 's fun to play

#s170
I 'll give it that

#s171
It is fun to play If you do n't value your very much

#s173
But you know I do n't think rugby will ever be professional

#s174
but it it 's it 's

#s177
No

#s178
You ca n't stay healthy and do that

#s179
That 's a rough game

#s182
But uh I do n't know

#s183
I do n't know how my Eagles are going to do this year

#s184
So you

#s185
the the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team

#s188
Yeah

#s189
My my it 's kind of odd

#s190
My roommate that I live with here he 's uh he 's lived in Pennock Minnesota

#s191
Do you know where that is

#s195
It it 's a small town

#s196
It 's about two hours

#s197
it 's in like central Minnesota

#s198
It 's a couple of hours uh west of Minneapolis

#s200
But uh

#s202
You just live there now

#s205
Uh-huh

#s206
Well he 's

#s208
Live in Florida

#s210
Like the Seahawks

#s212
Hey I I I 've only been to Philadelphia twice

#s213
and I you know I I still like

#s214
Really

#s215
really

#s218
Yeah

#s219
but
