#s3
Is that right

#s5
Well I never thought about that

#s6
but there is an Arlington

#s7
like I had a call the other day from Birmingham Michigan you know

#s9
and I was thinking yeah and I was thinking

#s11
the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama

#s14
Yeah

#s15
well tell me what kind of books have you read

#s18
I was going to say not fun kind right

#s22
Uh-huh

#s27
Yeah

#s28
it is

#s29
because you know that 's it 's really and truly a true thing

#s32
You know I read one about Bob Hope that I liked

#s34
Yeah

#s35
that was real good

#s36
I 'm like you

#s37
if it 's not a heavy biography you know I enjoy it

#s42
I was trying to think uh

#s43
I read a uh a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all

#s44
and there was a murder

#s46
Yeah

#s47
it was some time ago

#s48
Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING or something like that

#s50
It was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know

#s53
Yeah

#s54
in fact I believe it was

#s55
because

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
I believe

#s60
Yeah

#s61
I think it was by her now that you mention it because someone had given it to me

#s62
and I thought well this will be great

#s63
and it was

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Well when you use real people like that I think royalty especially you know

#s73
Yeah

#s74
but you know that 's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know

#s77
Our movie stars

#s78
because it 's totally different concept to us

#s80
I have n't I have n't had a chance to read a lot lately either

#s81
I have read uh mostly novels

#s82
I went to visit my daughter in Florida

#s84
and I took a novel with me uh and read it at Thanksgiving time

#s85
and uh it was uh one of those generation novels you know

#s87
starts out when they 're small and continues through generations

#s89
and I like that

#s91
Yes

#s92
I have

#s94
Oh she is wonderful

#s99
I stayed up one night I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I star- I could not put it down

#s105
Well no

#s106
it seems like she does n't write as often as oh well like Danielle Steele and those silly things

#s107
She writes the same thing

#s109
Yeah

#s110
and and they 're the same silly things

#s111
I mean if you 've read one I mean it 's It it 's practically the same thing over and over you know

#s115
Yeah

#s116
would n't I you know

#s117
I 'm criticizing her

#s118
and would n't I like to have her money

#s120
because they go from hardback to paperback

#s121
and she has millions of them

#s123
Uh-huh

#s124
You know mini series and so forth

#s125
and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often

#s126
I have not seen as many of hers

#s129
Uh-huh

#s130
I think she does a lot of research too

#s133
Huh-uh

#s136
No

#s137
I do n't think so

#s138
and I 've often wondered why have n't you

#s140
You know I

#s144
Yeah

#s147
Uh-huh

#s148
Maybe they 're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know

#s150
Uh-huh

#s154
Yeah

#s155
And maybe that turns people off

#s156
but look at GONE WITH THE WIND you know

#s159
Uh have you uh gotten into SCARLETT yet

#s163
Yeah

#s164
that 's exactly what I was going to say

#s165
I was amazed

#s166
because I

#s167
in the beginning when it was on you know on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad

#s170
and then when it came out all I heard was just oh how bad it was that I did n't even want to get it

#s173
Huh-uh

#s176
No

#s178
Well it would n't surprise me
