#s2
Well uh I ca n't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago uh because I 'm not that old yet

#s4
Um

#s7
Uh I know that uh

#s8
I mean obviously you look at at technologic- the technological aspect of of social change

#s9
I mean you did n't have uh you did n't have video games

#s10
You did n't have home computers

#s11
You did n't have Xerox machines

#s13
I mean uh you you try to

#s14
you go into a a business today

#s15
and you you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper

#s16
and it 's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and and everything have become such you know su- such a a par- a part of the way we live

#s19
And MUMBLEx

#s20
Yeah

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah uh

#s25
a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail

#s26
and you had to do something

#s27
this was concerning the S E C

#s28
and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail

#s30
And now it 's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute Because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine

#s34
and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder

#s36
Because you 're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute

#s44
Uh-huh

#s47
Yeah

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Uh-huh

#s70
Well there 's that

#s71
and there 's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen

#s72
I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it were n't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country

#s78
Yeah

#s79
yeah

#s80
I saw that the numbers on that awhile back

#s81
and I was like uh-huh

#s82
so

#s87
Well uh In terms of the long term effect effect on on America in terms of the culture and everything I do n't know

#s89
Uh Most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an ex- ex- extremely large par- part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation f- uh from immigrant parents

#s93
And they 're going to be really struggling

#s94
and I do n't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good

#s97
I mean it 's no longer the the uh the accomplishment that it that it once was

#s98
and not that many people are really trying I do n't think

#s106
Yeah

#s109
Yeah

#s110
tha-
