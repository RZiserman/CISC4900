Go ahead

#s7
Um

#s9
Well you should you should have some opinions on that then

#s14
Well I guess if I were going to choose I mean my first consideration would be safety

#s16
My second consideration would be uh uh health

#s18
And uh I guess my third consideration would be uh warm environment warm personal environment

#s26
Oh absolutely

#s27
As a matter of fact I believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children

#s30
And it 's the most difficult of all for a parent judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving

#s32
but if he 's a space cadet and does n't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are

#s39
Maybe the right thing to do is to uh

#s40
when a couple has a child then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and I think I would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting

#s42
Get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six

#s44
And then uh and then of course to make up for that uh the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer you know

#s45
in other words they probably would not work may not en- may end up not working at all d- in the twenties

#s46
Uh

#s48
But then they have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety

#s51
Right

#s52
well you know the uh uh the world is changing f- uh from instit- from uh industrial uh base to uh information base

#s53
and so what that means is you do n't have to be physically powerful to work

#s56
All you have to do is have a sharp mind

#s57
and I believe that uh mental acuity is easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind

#s59
So I think a person could work uh into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter

#s60
if they did n't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could main- maintain uh
