So uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy

#s4
Oh I do n't know

#s5
I had a little bit more time to think about it

#s6
I was thinking of like uh

#s7
I do n't know

#s8
I was ju- started to think about all the big you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those you know demographics studies that they do that um you know have who knows how much you know stuff about all the purchases that you 've made and everything kept tract somewhere

#s11
and I do n't know

#s12
I do n't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there

#s13
but I know they use that I mean they sell those

#s16
Yeah

#s17
that was that that was the other one I was thinking of

#s18
I think that 's uh

#s19
I mean I know drugs are illegal

#s22
Huh Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s37
Well I I think the I think that you know a person 's competence should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior

#s38
and if they 're you know if they 're on some kind of you know contol- controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate them

#s39
I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a you know a chemical you know

#s41
These people that are carriers and do n't that do n't reveal it

#s45
Yeah tha- that would be kind of an extreme

#s47
I mean I 've heard of things like you know making them you know marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all someplace like in a kind of

#s49
Yeah

#s50
Wel- I guess it kind of borders on where I mean what do you value more The invasion of uh the person 's privacy or the possible danger to you know other people

#s53
Yeah

#s54
I guess that 's alwa- that 's been the big role of government I guess I mean generally

#s56
Yeah

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Well that 's kind of a difficult one to go into

#s59
I mean that that particular case

#s62
Because I mean there 's a lot of people that uh

#s63
I mean they could require you know ob- obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I 'm you know there 's a huge part of the population

#s64
not a huge part but a you know

#s66
the AIDS population I guess that have it that do n't know they do are spreading it

#s68
But again to require you know such a test and jus- and then to make make it MUMBLEx is to subject them to to discrimi- discriminatory practices and other things

#s69
I do n't know

#s70
uh I do n't know how exactly I feel about that
