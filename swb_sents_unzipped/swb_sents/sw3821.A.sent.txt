Well credit cards

#s3
I 'll tell you what

#s4
I I ca n't say a whole lot about credit cards because I uh tore mine up

#s7
Yeah

#s8
uh I got in some problems with uh financial problems because of credit cards

#s9
so I uh basically just got rid of all of them

#s11
I I have a a couple

#s12
I have a uh gas card that I that I use just for gas and you know uh one that I use just for emergencies

#s14
but

#s22
Yeah

#s23
I know it

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Oh is that right

#s34
That 's a that 's a good policy

#s40
Yeah

#s41
Yeah

#s42
uh sometimes I wish I had them

#s43
but in most cases I 'm glad I do n't because I you know unfortunately I I I do n't have the control you have

#s45
I wish I did

#s46
but but I do n't

#s48
Uh and it you know it

#s49
I just do n't want to get into that situation again

#s50
so we 'll

#s56
Oh that 's it

#s57
See and that 's

#s58
even with my gas card you know I find that I 'll go in to get some gas

#s60
and I 'll end up buying you know candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever

#s62
and then at the end of the month I you know I get a bill

#s63
and I 'm thinking what did I get that costs so much

#s66
And

#s71
Yeah

#s72
that that 's true

#s73
but I can I can under- certainly understand where

#s75
You know

#s80
Oh yeah

#s81
Is n't it

#s82
that 's unbelievable

#s83
How

#s84
let me ask you this

#s85
How how old are you

#s87
Thirty-three

#s90
Okay

#s91
You 'll be thirty-three this year

#s93
You want to be thirty-two as long as you can huh

#s94
It 's coming

#s96
Yeah

#s97
I I know what you mean about the interest rates

#s98
It 's uh it 's unbelievable

#s102
Uh-huh

#s108
Oh jeez

#s112
Yeah

#s113
and then you bet

#s115
That 's

#s116
uh yeah

#s117
I in fact I 've I 've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less uh rates and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know

#s123
And I I guess there 's some there 's uh uh some negotiating there too

#s124
because I heard uh

#s125
on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh call you know

#s126
if you 've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating you can call your in- you know your your card wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees

#s127
or I 'll just go to somewhere else

#s132
You know and if you 've got if you 've got a pretty good uh uh history with them they 're more than willing to do that

#s136
Yeah

#s137
in fact that 's that 's what this guy

#s138
you know he wrote a book on it

#s139
and he says that 's you know he 's tried it sev- with several of his cards

#s141
and he 's just told them you know I I can get this card from this bank at this rate

#s142
and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent

#s144
It does not make sense for me to do that

#s145
and if you wo n't drop my rates I 'll just go ahead and send you back your card

#s146
and I 'll go somewhere else and get it

#s153
Uh-huh
