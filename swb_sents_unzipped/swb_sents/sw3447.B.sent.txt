Well I 'm a drafter

#s19
so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes

#s20
and I have sweatshirt on today

#s22
And that 's pretty much the norm for me

#s23
If I come in in a dress everybody 's shocked

#s26
They ask me you know what are you doing in a dress

#s27
and it 's usually I have n't done my laundry lately

#s29
Ran out of jeans

#s33
No

#s36
No

#s37

#s40

#s41

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
Yeah

#s46
Yeah

#s47
yeah

#s48
Every now and then I 'll get dressed up and come in

#s49
but that 's for my husband 's job and not mine

#s52
I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him

#s53
but

#s55
So

#s59

#s66
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70

#s73
Mi- middle of the road

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
uh-huh

#s77
Sometimes I think there should be

#s78
Some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines

#s83
And you know the they have the no shorts deal

#s84
and some of these mini skirts you know are worse than shorts ever thought about being

#s86
But uh You know that 's I guess that 's one of the things you got to put up with when you do n't have a dress code

#s93
Supposedly and backless things

#s96
but I 've seen those too

#s97
but

#s101
Uh yeah
