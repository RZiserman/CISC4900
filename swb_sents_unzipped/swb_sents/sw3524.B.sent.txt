#s2
Oh my

#s3
yeah

#s4
Well and Plano Texas rather than Plano Illinois

#s6
Yes

#s7
they do

#s10
Yeah

#s11
Well let 's see

#s12
the three questions are what uh

#s14
Very little Because they 're grown

#s17
They 're grown and gone

#s21
Huh

#s23
Yeah

#s25
because they do n't want to know they almost do n't want to know us

#s29
Uh yes

#s30
I have uh two married two almo- and then two almost married

#s31
and the other two I 'm not sure

#s32
Well Two s- two two uh uh for sure are single

#s34
Yeah

#s35
we have between the spouse and myself we have six

#s38
Because I came with a split family

#s39
and she had

#s40
Well no

#s41
there is so much of them are gone

#s42
and they 're doing their own things

#s43
and and a lot of times they they 've got you know uh

#s44
when the holidays

#s47
Yeah

#s48
and sometimes they want to do their own thing

#s49
so sometimes it 's just spouse and me

#s51
And and you know what

#s53
Sometimes that 's okay

#s55
Because

#s57
You know

#s58
right

#s59
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays

#s64
Yeah

#s65
That becomes a drudgery

#s66
and

#s67
Well let 's see

#s69
n- got of the six we 've got four around here

#s72
Uh you know well we 're talking like north Texas

#s74
And then one is in Vermont uh Montpe- Mont- Montpelier Montpelier Vermont

#s76
and the other one is in Everett Washington

#s78
Well that is that 's the the my little pair And my second marriage

#s80
Uh and uh

#s82
Yeah

#s83
well the s-

#s84
the the the the fourth and fifth child of the of the of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that

#s87
And Well they wanted to go uh

#s89
J R my my my last son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with Washington state

#s92
and the the the third daughter fell in love with uh uh Vermont

#s94
So

#s96
Yeah

#s97
that 's where they 've gone to make their homes

#s100
No

#s102
Well uh let 's see

#s103
yeah

#s104
I guess you 'd say J R is working going to s- trying to go to school

#s106
I wish to God he would go back

#s108
Yeah

#s109
Well I certainly hope so

#s113
Uh-huh

#s114
Well it 's oh I agree it 's never too late

#s116
And

#s118
Yeah

#s119
and when you 're saying older we 're talking fifty up

#s123
Uh-huh

#s126
Oh my

#s127
uh-huh

#s128
Yes

#s129
why not

#s130
because that 's a a lot of times

#s131
well it 's

#s132
I believe that uh we in that category

#s133
and I 'm not in that category quite yet

#s135
but we are seasoned minds

#s138
Yes

#s139
uh-huh

#s141
Yeah

#s142
it was

#s144
Yeah

#s145
settle down

#s146
we know what we 're wanting to to uh study

#s147
and uh we know our limitations

#s153
And we do n't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether

#s156
At seven

#s157
yeah

#s159
Yes

#s160
we 're we 're smarter now

#s162
Yeah

#s163
right

#s164
uh so let 's see

#s165
So mine I do n't spend a whole lot of time because they 're not here

#s167
And so the second question forgot what the second question

#s171
Well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing

#s173
But I have seen lately yes I am seeing I 'm seeing a change that whoops government ca n't do it

#s176
schools are not able to

#s179
and between a person 's religion uh their their faith in their maker w- whether you know uh whether you 're Christian or Jewish or whatever uh

#s182
and the family

#s184
those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal

#s185
and of course Judeo-Christianity uh and of the Jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the uh uh mission by the Lord to do this very thing

#s187
So when another group of of uh people step in try to do it they 're they 're tromping on our territory so to speak

#s188
so

#s190
I firmly believe that uh
