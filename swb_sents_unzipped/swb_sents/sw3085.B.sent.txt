Okay

#s3
I

#s4
my children as a matter of fact are all grown now

#s5
So I am assisting them with their children in their selections

#s8
so

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
Well I myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today 's environment than the one on one care is

#s24
Uh when my children were growing up I actually had them up and until they were in the preschool situation I had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids

#s25
and I felt like that home environment was very important to them

#s27
It was important to me

#s29
and uh I feel like that they they had that one on one that 's so necessary at that age

#s32
However in today 's environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that 's the way our young people are are dealt with

#s37
They 're dealt with in packages

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s45
Sure

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
Absolutely

#s53
Oh absolutely

#s54
without a doubt

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
I recently stopped by McDonalds

#s58
and I was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children

#s59
and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center

#s60
and of course she was she had just gotten her degree

#s61
and she was so enthusiastic

#s62
and she was excited about it

#s63
and she was going to accomplish all of these things

#s66
however uh when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal

#s69
and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really do n't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment

#s75
Absolutely

#s77
Uh-huh

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
Well they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that that they pay

#s82
They are to be there ahead of time you know

#s83
they 're there early to receive the kids

#s85
That 's right

#s88
And then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six P M

#s89
and then it 's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they do n't have cleaning crews in most of those

#s94
And uh she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary

#s97
Uh and she

#s99
Uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s103
Uh-huh

#s106
Sure

#s108
Uh-huh

#s110
Well I know that when my youngsters were small

#s111
now my older son was adopted

#s112
so he went into child care at two weeks

#s114
and uh my younger son went into child care at six weeks

#s117
So they were in that environment actually up until they became uh seven and nine

#s119
And at that point I said Look they have been given the custodial care that they need

#s120
and the after hours care has been as good a quality as I can provide for them

#s121
However they 're going out into the school environment now

#s122
they 're under a lot of other influences

#s123
I need to be here for them

#s124
I need to be involved in their school because I want to be the one who influences the way they develop

#s126
So I quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that I could help direct their their learning experiences and their development

#s131
I I felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them

#s135
But when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that that they 're going to need to interact with other people I felt like I needed some strong influence there

#s139
So I di-

#s142
I know

#s143
That 's right

#s144
once they get up in sch-

#s145
Uh-huh

#s146
Uh-huh

#s147
uh-huh

#s149
Well I just felt very strongly about that

#s150
and I I did not work as a matter of fact

#s151
my son was in the second grade

#s152
and when he started uh at Skyline High School I asked him Son when uh you know where do I go to sign up for the P T A

#s153
And he said Mom do n't do that to me

#s154
please do n't do that to me

#s155
So I knew it was time to go back to work

#s156
But I feel very good about spending those years with my boys

#s160
Uh and I was just really grateful I only had one bad child care experience

#s161
It was in a home

#s162
Uh the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it

#s163
She was from um uh uh Argentina

#s165
and she was going back home

#s166
and I could n't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her

#s168
so I had to find a new place

#s170
and I put them in this home

#s171
the kids cried when I took them

#s172
the kids cried wh- I could hear the kids crying when I went to pick them up

#s174
they were always cranky and irritable

#s176
so I just took off and went there one day

#s177
and uh the children were left unattended in a room you know

#s178
they they were not well cared for

#s180
and uh so it did n't take me long to take them out of that place

#s183
but that 's the only bad experience I had

#s184
the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy

#s186
and I was very pleased with their development and their progress

#s188
They learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they did n't learn

#s189
but they 're going to learn it sometime

#s190
so but for the most part they did have good care

#s193
and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them

#s194
and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim which just pleased me to death because I 've always been ha- you know been afraid of the water

#s198
however my older son came home

#s199
and he said Mom I do n't like that man said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me I had to get my face wet or I 'd never swim

#s202
boy

#s203
it did n't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school and relay that to them

#s205
and she said Well she said you know kids do exaggerate

#s206
but she said let 's go ahead and send him another day or two days

#s207
and I promise you faithfully I will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what 's happening
