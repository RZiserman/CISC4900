For N I S T the National Institute of Standards and Technology

#s4
I suppose so

#s5
Let me push the button

#s7
Okay uh

#s8
I guess I 'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system

#s9
but uh I sense that it 's not going to happen anytime soon

#s14
Uh-huh

#s17
You 're now in what

#s19
Acoustics uh

#s26
Well I guess that is the policy

#s27
but it 's been the policy for a long time

#s28
and nothing ever happens

#s29
Uh I suppose things some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening having a new generation come up that 's more used to it

#s32
They have to for international trade

#s34
But I g- guess it 's it 's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be uh be- be- because of of uh of computers coming into everything

#s41
Everyone wants a wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a as as as as a concept to hold in mind

#s43
Uh I I I do n't see that it it it can change it very quickly

#s44
I mean we 're not the kind of society that that uh that something can be posed upon uh by government will

#s48
Uh the the the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems uh money dollar coins anything like that

#s50
And and and it it obviously makes no sense that we 're practically alone in the world in in using the old system

#s60
Well I mean unfortunate- I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day

#s65
Uh I mean there are things you could do

#s66
Uh we have signs up on the N I S T campus here speed limit twenty-five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour

#s68
Uh but that has n't been adopted very widely

#s73
But I mean and no one will will go a step further to remove the english signs

#s76
Uh yeah

#s77
or you have highway signs saying speed limit uh eighty eighty-five whatever would be the appropriate number

#s80
Hundred car is going sixty-two

#s81
yeah

#s82
so it would be more like uh like ninety I guess

#s83
car is going fifty-five

#s84
Uh you suddenly have a have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now

#s87
Do do do you know where you are do the schools emphasize the metric system

#s90
No

#s91
I I I meant I meant down like in the elementary schools

#s96
I mean I think

#s98
Yeah

#s99
I mean I think my children learned the metric system

#s100
but it does n't get get emphasized over the other
