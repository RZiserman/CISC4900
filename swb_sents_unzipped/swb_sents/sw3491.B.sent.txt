#s1
Well let me see

#s2
what have you seen lately

#s4
FIVE

#s6
yeah

#s7
Y-

#s8
only only five

#s11
Well no

#s12
did n't need to

#s16
I just saw the latest one

#s18
It was fantastic

#s20
Yeah

#s21
it 's

#s22
the lines in there were just perfect

#s23
I mean it was classic TREK

#s25
No

#s26
huh-uh

#s29
Yeah

#s30
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time

#s31
However the rumor is is that it will happen next happen next time

#s32
so

#s34
Uh-huh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Yeah

#s40
uh except that the rumor is is that they still might

#s41
but it may not include the entire crew

#s42
and it will be a next generation meets this generation

#s44
So

#s46
I think it 's a hundred years

#s48
Somewhere in that range

#s49
Considering that Spock was on an uh you know couple weeks ago and that the the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION they had McCoy

#s53
And

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
Yeah

#s56
well you know he was rear admiral whatever you know

#s57
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow

#s58
Vulcans age a lot better

#s61
No

#s62
huh-uh

#s63
Matter of fact he looks just as about as old and the uh NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK

#s64
Imagine that

#s68
Oh excellent excellent special effects

#s69
But I think the script was you know just incredible compared to the last one

#s72
Well you know why

#s76
Uh William Shatner wrote it

#s78
And even worse he directed it

#s81
Oh yeah

#s82
he in fact uh he did n't direct this one

#s83
He produced this one

#s84
But he directed the one before uh I think STAR TREK FOUR something like that

#s86
Yeah

#s87
uh-huh

#s89
L-

#s90
I think so

#s94
Uh-huh

#s96
Well I 've gone to you know one for real live Trek Convention

#s97
but

#s99
Yeah

#s100
I saw James Doohan you know the guy that plays uh Scotty

#s102
No

#s104
Not in a crowd like that

#s105
Huh-uh

#s107
It was like uh want an autograph want to stand in line for about four hours

#s110
It was a pretty crowded place

#s113
Oh yeah

#s114
yeah

#s115
I

#s116
it 's it 's kind of funny

#s117
I uh was reading in uh a book

#s118
Uh trying to think

#s119
I ca n't quite remember the name of the book

#s120
but it was it was saying do n't do STAR TREK management style

#s121
And they were referring to you know Captain Kirk

#s122
every time he left the Enterprise everything went to hell

#s124
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship

#s127
Uh-huh

#s130
Uh-huh

#s131
yeah

#s132
uh it 's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really

#s134
Uh saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week

#s136
It was pretty good

#s137
Uh there were a few things different than the old series

#s138
but on the on the whole it was pretty similar And a lot of fun

#s140
Oh yeah

#s141
yeah

#s144
Oh yes

#s145
in fact Thing has a big much bigger role than he does in the series

#s146
I mean you know there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day

#s148
And he runs around a lot

#s151
Uh you know just finger hopping

#s153
No

#s154
no

#s155
no

#s156
in fact it 's funny

#s157
He never did does come in out of a box I do n't think

#s158
Yeah

#s159
he was just kind of walking around

#s161
Not really

#s162
He was always in the box before

#s165
Yeah
