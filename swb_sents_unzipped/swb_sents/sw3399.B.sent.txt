#s3
Um

#s5
Yes

#s6

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Right

#s15
Um

#s16
Right

#s17

#s18
And it 's depending on where you live though too

#s23
Yeah

#s24
That 's true

#s25
Ten years ago I was eleven

#s26
Oh I remember though like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now

#s27
And gas

#s29
and I used to hear stories from my Grandpa

#s30
and you know he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that

#s35
Yeah

#s39
Yeah

#s40
I 'm from Wisconsin

#s41
yeah MUMBLEx

#s46
Oh yeah

#s47
I spoke to a person from Texas too

#s49
This is only my second phone call

#s50
so I 'm waiting for mine

#s54
Um

#s56
Oh like like social changes

#s58
Um um and I do n't think this would have anything to do with it

#s59
but like clothing and styles lot of those changed

#s66
Yeah

#s67
Uh-huh

#s68

#s74

#s76
Yeah

#s79
Yeah

#s81
It 's just ridiculous

#s82
fads in and out

#s83
And even um clothing from the sixties came back

#s85
I see a lot of um girls wearing sixties clothes

#s94
Yeah

#s96
Yeah

#s97
That 's true

#s98
maybe some day

#s99
I probably wo n't be alive to see it

#s100
but prices might go down lot more

#s102
I do n't know though

#s103
does n't look good

#s105
Yeah

#s106
