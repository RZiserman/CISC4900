#s6
It sure is

#s7
I play at least three times a week

#s9
I 'm on it

#s15
No

#s16
Well I 'm one of those rare left-handed golfers

#s19
And I do enjoy playing

#s21
Right now it 's three

#s25
Well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down

#s31
Uh well we can usually play here year around

#s32
Sometimes in January it 's not too comfortable to play

#s34
But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play

#s35
and I 'm pretty much addicted to golf

#s36
so I get out there one way or the other

#s40
It 's a good game though

#s41
It 's very challenging

#s42
and the reason I like it so much is because I 'm essentially playing against myself

#s44
That 's the way I look at it

#s45
I I play in in lo- a lot of groups

#s46
and but I they keep score and between themselves

#s47
but I really do n't care

#s48
Um I go out

#s49
and each shot I say well this is what I 'm going to try to do

#s51
and then I see how close I can come to that

#s56
Yeah

#s57
and i- inevitably one facet of my game is n't working at one time or another

#s58
Either I 'm not driving very well

#s59
or I 'm not hitting long irons very well

#s60
or I 'm not putting well

#s61
or but sometimes it all comes together

#s70
Well we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst

#s72
And I went to that

#s73
Craig Statler won in a playoff

#s75
But we uh

#s76
this is a big golf area

#s78
We have a lot of uh

#s79
I 'd say we probably have within fifteen miles twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course Pine Hurst

#s80
and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year

#s83
Yes

#s84
we do as a matter of fact

#s85
It it uh it 's only been that way in the last five years

#s87
But now you uh

#s88
most of the courses have a uh two day advance tee time you have to call

#s95
That 's some cold golf too is n't it

#s98
We have cold

#s100
Usually January and the first two weeks of February

#s102
But uh last week we were in the seventies

#s103
Something is coming through now

#s104
so it 's like in the low forties right now

#s106
But uh it 's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties

#s107
We have very windy winters and very cold

#s109
But we do n't get any snow anymore

#s110
I do n't I do n't know what changed that pattern

#s111
We used to get four or five inches a year

#s112
Now we get nothing

#s113
It 's been probably five years since we 've had any measurable snowfall

#s117
No

#s118
but I have played golf in the snow before

#s119
Get out my orange golf ball and go out
