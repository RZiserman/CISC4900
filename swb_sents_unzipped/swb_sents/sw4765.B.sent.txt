#s2
Uh-huh

#s4
Uh-huh

#s11
Sure

#s12
sure

#s14
Huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Yeah

#s19
Uh well I guess I I guess I 'm probably a little more to toward the other direction

#s20
Uh well I guess mainly because uh it 's I

#s21
well like there 's two sides to it I guess

#s22
Uh one is that uh if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it 's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then I I think that that you know I do n't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot

#s23
Uh but I guess I feel more like whatever you 're doing in your own private life is your own private business

#s24
Uh and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go

#s25
You know we had prohibition for awhile

#s26
and then we did n't have prohibition

#s27
Uh you know we 've had I guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years I guess

#s29
Maybe a little longer

#s31
Yeah

#s32
So ei- eighty years or so

#s33
Yeah

#s35
Uh so I you know

#s36
it 's it 's hard to I guess for me to justify what so- seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amen- you know freedom from uh search and seizure you know uh on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten

#s37
who knows

#s39
I mean prohibition certainly did n't last

#s41
Well but you got to look at prohibition though

#s42
You had the same problems there right

#s46
Oh yeah

#s47
Sure

#s48
Well it goes back to that again if you look at prohibition

#s49
I mean because it 's illegal it costs more

#s50
If it was legal

#s51
I mean face it

#s52
you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce

#s54
And clearly if you 're into coke and all you want to do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap

#s55
and you know you 'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it

#s57
But yeah

#s58
get uh

#s62
Oh yeah

#s63
well that 's why there 's you know people dealing it because there 's money in it you know

#s64
There 's ridiculous amounts of money

#s68
Oh yeah

#s69
interdiction 's hopeless

#s70
I mean

#s73
there 's no way you 're ever going to win that

#s75
The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is

#s76
I mean that 's a losing fight

#s81
Yeah

#s82
yeah

#s84
Well yeah

#s85
It goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people

#s86
I mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen

#s88
I do n't think you can

#s89
I mean you know I 'm you know was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic

#s90
so you know I 'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people

#s92
So you know yeah

#s93
I can really relate to

#s94
yeah

#s95
everybody ought to do their own share you know

#s96
I do n't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they 're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff

#s98
But you know
