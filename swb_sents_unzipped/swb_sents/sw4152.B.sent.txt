#s5
Uh I 'm Ann

#s10
Criminal courts

#s11
Yes

#s15
Oh really

#s19
Uh-huh

#s21
I see

#s22
I ca n't

#s23
I 'm a little surprised they did n't get a change of venue on that one

#s27
Oh

#s31
Well that videotape was just horrible

#s34
Yes

#s37
Oh I agree with you

#s38
but I ca n't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff

#s44
Right

#s47
Exactly

#s48
Based on fact

#s49
Right

#s50
How interesting

#s51
Oh

#s52
So what 's the prevailing thought within the community

#s54
I mean you know what the news media is going to make of it

#s55
but what about the community

#s60
Uh-huh

#s61
Oh my goodness

#s62
That ca n't be good for Los Angeles either

#s68
Oh exactly

#s69
Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles

#s70
You 're going to have it just about anywhere

#s72
There

#s74
But that 's that 's interesting

#s77
What about the judge who 's hearing the case

#s78
Is he going to be impartial

#s79
Is he going to be a go- a good adjudicator

#s87
Uh-huh

#s90
Oh really

#s96
Oh my goodness

#s99
To get that judge recalled I would think

#s102
Huh

#s103
That 's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences

#s106
It would

#s108
Uh

#s110
you would know the whole world would know what you were facing

#s111
And then it 's a matter of of deciding
