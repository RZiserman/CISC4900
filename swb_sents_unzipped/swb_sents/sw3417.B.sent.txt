#s3
Uh-huh

#s10
Right

#s11
Well I guess I kind of have mixed feelings

#s12
Um you know you always sit there

#s13
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it

#s14
and you wonder you know where 's it all going

#s16
and we have such a huge uh national deficit

#s17
and and I guess a lot of times there 's questions wondering well if it 's doing a whole lot of good

#s18
I know there 's a lot of social programs out there that need help

#s19
But you kind of always wonder well where 's where 's the money going

#s21
Uh-huh

#s25
I 'm sorry

#s26
I could n't

#s28
Right

#s29
right

#s30
Yeah

#s31
I agree with that

#s32
As far as other countries I 'm not um I do n't keep up on it too much as to far as what you know as what they 're do-

#s33
I know

#s34
we were in Ireland last year

#s36
and I know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here

#s37
but but as far as other countries I 'm not uh up to par on

#s40
Uh-huh

#s43
Uh-huh

#s46
Right

#s48
Right

#s49
Yeah

#s50
but and and you sit there and wonder um

#s51
I guess this does n't really have to do with taxes but just money in general and and um wondering if you 're going to have enough when you retire to live on

#s55
Uh-huh

#s56
yeah

#s57
that 's true

#s58
But um are you involved with the legislature up there

#s59
or which

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Okay

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
I was just wondering since you said Washington D C

#s66
and you and you picked this topic

#s67
I was just kind of curious

#s71
Oh you did n't

#s75
Oh did you

#s76
See I have n't placed any calls

#s77
Did they automatically assign the topic

#s81
Oh I did n't know that

#s82
I thought whoever made the call could choose what topic because I have n't made any calls yet

#s83
I 've just received some

#s85
Oh I did n't realize that

#s86
Okay

#s87
Yeah

#s88
because it 's kind of a it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you 're talking to

#s91
Exactly
