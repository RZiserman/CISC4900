Okay

#s2
so what are what are your views on capital punishment

#s6
Yes

#s9
So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state

#s13
Yes

#s14
that 's similar to Georgia

#s17
That 's probably true considering

#s18
Yes

#s19
Yes

#s20
uh I guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if

#s22
Yes

#s23
Right

#s24
that would be the intent of it

#s27
Well I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there were n't so many appeals

#s30
Yeah

#s31
if if the person who 's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment

#s34
Uh I 'm a research engineer

#s35
I work uh f- with Georgia Tech

#s37
Um

#s39
Yes

#s42
Um

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Um that 's probably true

#s48
but I guess there 's other factors that

#s50
But p- p- pumping more money into the school system is a good thing

#s52
but it 's not going to

#s53
Oh I see

#s60
Uh-huh

#s63
Um

#s66
So that 's a difficult situation

#s70
Um

#s74
Uh-huh

#s78
Uh-huh

#s81
Well that 's probably true

#s82
W-

#s84
Um yeah

#s85
I guess that 's not an easy solution

#s86
There 's there 's no easy solution for that

#s90
Uh-huh

#s93
I 'm sure it is

#s94
yeah

#s96
Um yeah

#s97
I do n't I do n't

#s98
certainly capital punishment is n't going to solve a lot of problems

#s100
but

#s102
Uh

#s104
I guess I am for certain cri-

#s106
yeah

#s107
in certain crimes

#s109
Uh premeditated murder Crimes of that nature I think should definitely

#s111
any mass murderer type individual

#s113
Um

#s114
Uh-huh

#s115
Well you always have castration

#s117
Yes

#s118
I read about that

#s120
Uh-huh
