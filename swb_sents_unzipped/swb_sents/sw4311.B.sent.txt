Oh okay

#s3
Yeah

#s4
the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care

#s5
and that 's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children

#s6
but I did run a child care facility for a while

#s8
And uh have some

#s10
I do have some thoughts on that

#s11
yeah

#s12
Uh it 's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or parent for a lot of people there

#s13
and uh it 's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities

#s15
Right

#s17
Right

#s19
Well right

#s20
Uh in Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level

#s21
so you meet the standards

#s22
but then after that there 's there 's a lot more

#s23
I think it 's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there

#s24
and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people uh in terms of not just just

#s25
because somebody has a child or uh likes children does n't really mean that they 're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that uh

#s28
Exactly

#s29
And that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people

#s31
Oh

#s33
Oh exactly

#s34
And the other thing that 's difficult in uh it 's a too small setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you do n't want to just warehouse the child

#s35
and I did n't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important

#s36
and you have to have the right kind of enrichment

#s37
and that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe and and he 's watched and his physical needs are cared for

#s38
but also his uh developmental needs are cared for too

#s41
That would be lovely

#s43
Uh-huh

#s47
Well that 's an interesting thought because

#s49
That would be okay

#s50
That would that would help on the other end too in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
That 's exactly right

#s58
Oh
