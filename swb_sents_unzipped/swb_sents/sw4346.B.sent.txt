Okay

#s3
you go first

#s6
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s25
Uh-huh

#s28
Well yeah

#s29
it it 's it 's pretty much what I was going to say is there 's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in

#s31
Uh I grew up in New York

#s32
and uh the place

#s34
or not New York City upstate New York

#s36
and I went to uh the City of Rochester School District

#s38
and s- a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs

#s39
and it was n't we were n't too far removed geographically from each other

#s40
but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial

#s42
and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system

#s44
And that would result in some uh could result in more equitable distribution of money

#s45
because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs

#s46
and the city had a very low tax base

#s47
so they did n't have a lot of money to work with

#s49
As a result the schools were rundown

#s50
there was n't as many you know of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked

#s51
There was n't as many advanced placement courses uh when I was a senior that some other schools had

#s53
And uh it it

#s54
so I you know I think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people

#s55
and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they 'll move farther away to get better schools

#s58
So you know it it 's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of

#s66
Yeah

#s69
Uh-huh

#s72
Uh-huh

#s73
Yeah

#s74
Why is that

#s76
Why is that

#s89
Right

#s90
Right

#s95
Right

#s101
Uh-huh

#s103
Yeah

#s104
yeah

#s105
Yeah

#s106
I know that that that was a big factor for me

#s107
I ended up coming out of of the public school system very well

#s108
and was very good education uh

#s110
ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice

#s112
and I think the difference for me was that my parents were you know they were definitely they were always there

#s114
was like well

#s115
yeah

#s116
of course you 're going to study and do well

#s117
and that 's the way

#s118
of course are you
