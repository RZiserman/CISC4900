#s3
Uh that might be a lot to do with it

#s4
I know a lot of it here in my state

#s5
I 'm from Mississippi

#s6
I 'm not sure where you 're from

#s8
Minnesota

#s9
okay

#s10
Well a lot of it in Mississippi here has got to do with funding

#s12
Problems with our educational system a lot of it 's due to money

#s14
And they 're trying to spend money where we do n't have it

#s15
and there 's a lot of things we need that we just ca n't afford

#s19
Well it is

#s22
Right

#s23
That 's true

#s24
And a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money

#s27
Cause if you ca n't pay the right people you know they 're not to be able to do they 're not not going to get the people that can do a good job

#s34
Right

#s35
Right

#s36
I feel the same way

#s37
A lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home

#s40
And then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids

#s41
I mean they 've so severely limited what disciplinary action you can do

#s45
Exactly

#s46
Right

#s48
Lose their job and big lawsuit and all that

#s51
I feel that 's got a lot to do with it

#s52
People are n't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be

#s57
Really

#s58
We we 've talked some about it in my state because we 've had a lot of uh prob-

#s59
our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education

#s60
but he was n't

#s62
And a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly

#s63
I know a lot a lot of

#s64
if you have more money it 's just logical that you can provide a better school system

#s66
And unfortunately there 's not many places to get that money

#s68
Then if you do n't have qualified teachers in the different MUMBLEx

#s69
I know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this

#s70
That most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level are n't scientists

#s71
they 're teachers

#s72
And they may not know a lot about what they 're teaching

#s73
Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses

#s74
and they 're trying to teach social studies

#s75
And they do n't know a lot about that

#s77
Where maybe a physics professor

#s78
he my professor was a physics professor

#s79
and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level

#s80
So therefore they 're teaching from a teacher 's point of view and not from a physicist point of view

#s81
And that causes a lot of trouble

#s87
Right

#s89
Exactly

#s90
Because I mean here in the town I went to high school

#s91
one of the there were four high schools in my county one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado

#s92
So when they rebuilt that school they had a a top of the line high tech school there

#s94
And the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties

#s95
and then when uh the evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones Telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building

#s96
and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we 'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them

#s106
Right

#s107
Exactly
