I have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town

#s22
and their schools are kind of rundown and uh older

#s23
and they do n't really offer as much I do n't know as uh the school that my girls are in

#s24
I do n't really think that 's fair You know

#s26
Uh but you know I 'm happy with what they 're in

#s27

#s65
All these kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something

#s67
You can go to north Tyler to the schools

#s68
and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid 's teacher 's name is You know

#s70
uh that has a a whole lot to do with it you know

#s71
as far as their learning I mean if the parents are n't uh you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they 're learning and if they 're learning you know they really do n't have much of a chance at all

#s75
Huh

#s77
Why you asking

#s78
You j- they just do n't

#s79
I mean I mean I 'm I 'm up there at my kids ' school

#s80
I know what they 're learning

#s81
and if they 're up I call and find out you know

#s82

#s83
does she need help with anything

#s84
no

#s85
she 's doing fine

#s86
okay you know uh

#s87
and I I know kids that their parents could really give a rip

#s88
and the kids are not motivated

#s91
They have no motivation from home

#s92
so they just go to school

#s93
and you know eh you know I 'll get through the day and uh bring homework home

#s94
and there 's nobody to to sit them down and say you 're going to do this

#s96
Uh just you know they they take a notion to do it

#s97
they do

#s98
and uh that does n't work either you know

#s99
they have to have guidance

#s100
and uh they ca n't just have it at school and then come home

#s102
and there 's nothing you know

#s109
