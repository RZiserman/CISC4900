So what do you think about uh recycling programs in Atlanta Julie

#s7
I do n't know

#s8
there 's there 's big bins out there

#s9
I do n't know if they ever get

#s10
I I really do n't know what the details are

#s11
There should be someplace where you could call and find out

#s12
As a matter of fact I 'm pretty sure there 's a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you

#s13
but I think there should be some kind of curbside service

#s15
That 's the only way I could really

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
During the summers like the around where I live the uh homeless people see-

#s21
I mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff

#s23
and they 're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff

#s25
and so we used to just save them up

#s26
and then they 'd come around

#s27
and we 'd give them to them

#s29
But when

#s30
during the winter time I think they they move south or something

#s32
so I do n't do that anymore

#s33
And the the recycling at Georgia Tech like that uh outside the uh student center they never empty those things

#s37
They just overflow

#s39
So what 's a guy to do You know I asked myself

#s44
Really

#s45
Huh oh yeah

#s46
that 's true

#s47
had n't thought about that

#s48
That is very inconvenient

#s50
Inconvenient even

#s53
But uh

#s54
so you do recycle do n't you

#s56
Yeah

#s57
I 'm kind of I 'm kind of bad about it

#s59
If I if see a if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I 'll throw it in there

#s61
but I do n't really I do n't ever take anything

#s64
Uh-huh

#s66
But wait

#s68
I 've never seen you before

#s69
Who are you

#s71
Yeah

#s72
my name 's Bill

#s73
Well

#s75
Hi

#s77
Me too

#s79
Crazy

#s80
Uh well is there anything else you 'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie

#s82
Do they do

#s83
like what about like uh

#s84
what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle

#s85
do you know

#s87
Really

#s89
What about like those grocery bags

#s95
Uh-huh

#s96
Uh-huh

#s100
They 'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic

#s103
uh

#s105
Those petroleum products are going to kill us

#s108
The hostile planet I think Julie

#s110
The petroleum pretty much I mean those petroleum products I think are the big uh you know the great Satan of the recycling

#s115
Um

#s116
Paper just seems so innocuous

#s118
Paper does n't seem threatening at all you know

#s120
It comes from trees

#s121
How can it be bad

#s123
They treat it with chemicals or something

#s124
Why ca n't trees break down

#s125
I do n't get it

#s128
Yep

#s129
Oh

#s132
Really

#s134
Huh

#s137
I 'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads then

#s139
I 'm glad you told me that because I use those at work where I work

#s140
and uh But I can just forget that from now on

#s142
I 'm going u- I 'm going to switch to the white ones

#s145
Well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bam- you know bamboo stuff from the from the banks of the Nile

#s149
You think so

#s151
Tablets

#s153
I think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether you know

#s157
What do you think

#s159
Kind of radical I know

#s160
but

#s162
That 's true

#s163
Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist like uh Dick Tracy
