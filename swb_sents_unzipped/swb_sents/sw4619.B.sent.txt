Bye

#s2
So we 're uh our discussion 's about uh the care of the elderly

#s9
Uh well I actually my dad 's my dad 's almost ninety

#s10
and he lives by himself

#s12
and he 's in good shape

#s14
Uh but uh some friends of mine have uh gone through this

#s15
I think I 'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and uh where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive And where there was uh caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it

#s17
Do you have any experience with this yourself

#s20
Uh-huh

#s25
Uh-huh

#s32
From the lack of stimulation you mean

#s44
Do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you 'd perceive of as genuine concern

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
Yeah

#s53
Yeah

#s54
It it 's possible

#s55
I was thinking also that there 'd be there could be a fair burn out factor um in just having to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need

#s63
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
So it gives them a sense of identity

#s78
Yeah

#s79
I I think part of what you 're saying matches what I h- have read

#s80
I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who uh were adequately deficient in their abilities uh physical or mental that they could n't take care of themselves

#s82
But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide um a lot of social activities

#s85
Uh the one of my friend 's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities

#s86
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation

#s87
Uh and

#s93
Well I think it I think t- it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there

#s94
and I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there

#s97
And there there 's so much
