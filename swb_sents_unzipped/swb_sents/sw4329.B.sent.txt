Okay

#s7
Saginaw

#s12
Really

#s14
The rec-

#s15
we live in Plano

#s16
and they started off recycling by uh putting the

#s17
I think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now

#s18
I guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans

#s19
and uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now

#s20
and you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum

#s22
and you set it out

#s23
and they pick it up

#s24
and it it works real neat

#s25
They seem to be having a real good response

#s27
So

#s35
Did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for for cans

#s37
even or

#s41
Yeah

#s45
No

#s46
I just I noticed it

#s47
Iowa and other cities like that it 's a nickel per aluminum can

#s49
So you do n't see too many thrown out around the streets Or even bottles

#s51
You know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to I guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in

#s53
I n- I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel

#s56
Right

#s57
So maybe that 's one thing they can do

#s60
Uh-huh

#s64
Yes

#s66
Right

#s70
That was my brother 's first job in a grocery store

#s71
He was in the bottle area

#s73
It 's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over

#s74
but but it 's uh it 's quite

#s76
they say that the green glass now that there 's a big glut of green the green glass

#s79
yeah

#s80
It 's amazing

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
Right

#s87
Right

#s88
Yeah

#s89
it 's

#s90
I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs

#s92
It it 's

#s93
people just

#s94
they they really do n't

#s95
uh there 's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff

#s98
It 's

#s99
I do n't know

#s100
it it can be

#s101
it 's not as easy selecting you know clean junk as they say

#s104
That 's right

#s105
that 's right

#s106
It 's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher

#s109
We all do it

#s110
Well it was nice talking to you

#s113
Oh I think I think two or three minutes is fine

#s116
Yeah

#s120
Right

#s124
Well we 're doing it for a church choir

#s125

#s127
Yeah

#s129
