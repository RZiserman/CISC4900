#s1
Okay

#s2
How do you keep up with current events

#s5
Yeah

#s6
what what channel do you watch or what station

#s8
That 's the one I watch

#s9
I usually keep up with T V

#s10
I do n't

#s11
I am a student

#s12
so I really do n't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff

#s14
so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really is n't too great sometimes

#s19
Yeah

#s20
The radio does n't really have much news sometimes

#s21
The stations I listen to are just mainly music

#s24
Yeah

#s25
Do you think that T V is uh pretty accurate

#s26
I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized

#s27
or

#s30
Yeah

#s31
Yeah

#s32
it 's

#s33
they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news

#s37
Huh

#s38
Yeah

#s40
Going

#s41
they 're looks like they 're going more for ratings than for you know actual news

#s43
I think you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers

#s45
they typically have a better

#s46
I am from a small town too here in Texas

#s47
and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato

#s49
and

#s52
Yeah

#s53
farm report and oil reports

#s54
That 's pretty pretty sad

#s55
or who killed who

#s60
Yeah

#s61
Well in uh in Dallas I do n't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby 's

#s62
and the story was uh

#s64
Yeah

#s65
And the news covered it right you know hours after it happened

#s67
and they were taping people who were crying who had everything

#s69
and then like three days later this local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves

#s71
I just thought that was really that 's kind of cold

#s77
Yeah

#s78
and it was just

#s79
they were showing like these dead people

#s81
and they were showing people crying

#s83
I mean just taking advantage of you know

#s85
MUMBLEx

#s87
Yeah

#s88
it did n't seem like there was much coverage of the story but just the play on people 's emotions

#s89
It 's just gotten so

#s90
I mean somewhere there 's it 's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know

#s92
and everything

#s96
Yeah

#s98
Yeah

#s100
What did you think of the coverage of the war

#s102
Did you

#s104
Yeah

#s107
They kept just showing you know how great we were doing

#s108
and it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that 's

#s111
a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know the guys who did n't get hurt coming home and all the big parties

#s113
and they kind of you know

#s114
if they were going to show that why did n't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything
