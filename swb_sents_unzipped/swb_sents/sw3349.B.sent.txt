Well actually my hobbies now are T shirt making

#s3
I 'm making T shirts and sweat shirts

#s4
In fact that 's what I was doing when you called

#s7
Um right now I 'm making Christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing

#s10
Um no

#s11
I 'm have material that I cut out

#s12
and then you um

#s13
there 's this stuff called Wonder Under that you un- that you iron it on

#s14
and then you iron that on the T shirt

#s15
and you paint around it

#s17
So it 's real fun

#s18
I started doing it as a um just something fun to do

#s19
and now I 'm selling them

#s20
and pretty

#s22
Pretty good

#s23
I just started last week

#s24
and I sold seven

#s25
I did n't was n't expecting that

#s26
so

#s28
I guess in my spare time I 'll be making T shirts

#s29
So

#s31
That 's right you know

#s33
That 's correct

#s34
Well what are your hobbies

#s36
Uh-huh

#s42
Um

#s45
Oh my gosh

#s48
Well how 'd you learn to do that to fix them up

#s50
You just get a book that tells you how to do it or what

#s59
Uh-huh

#s66
Where 'd you get the car

#s69
Wow

#s72
Well that 's true

#s73
that 's true

#s74
Well that sounds neat

#s76
Let 's see

#s79
Well let 's see

#s80
I 've done other hobbies

#s81
I 'm a hobby person

#s82
I 've always done a lot of craft stuff

#s83
I always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that

#s84
and I collect dolls

#s85
I have a huge collection of dolls which is still in New Mexico with my parents

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
from New Mexico

#s90
So Let 's see

#s91
what else

#s92
I started collecting music boxes

#s93
I guess that 's a hobby

#s96
So

#s99
Probably o- uh about twenty

#s101
Uh-huh

#s103
They they all play different songs

#s106
The most expensive

#s107
I do n't know

#s108
I 've gotten all of them for gifts

#s109
I do n't

#s111
MUMBLEx bought a few of them

#s112
I usually get them for Christmas gifts or and like when people go you know to on trips or something

#s115
That 's true

#s116
I never collected those never collected those

#s118
I have dolls from all over too

#s119
That I started when I was a little girl

#s120
and I have a lot of dolls

#s122
People would always bring them when they go to the countries

#s123
and um and I did that when I went to Europe one summer

#s124
I bought a doll everywhere we went

#s125
so

#s127
MUMBLEx economy

#s128
It was great

#s129
it was quick

#s130
I was in I was in high school

#s131
and I was in a tour

#s132
and we went all

#s133
it 's kind of a it 's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries

#s134
and um it was called People to People

#s135
and we 'd stay in people 's homes

#s136
and then we got to also tour big cities

#s137
and I really enjoyed it

#s139
Uh-huh

#s141
in was in high school

#s142
So I 'd like to go back because we had you know

#s143
everything was rushed

#s145
everything was like an hour or two hours at the Louvre you know things like that where you need the whole day

#s146
but but it really

#s149
Exactly

#s150
that 's true

#s153
No

#s154
I always thought I would

#s155
but who knows now

#s156
I got married

#s157
and maybe some day

#s158
Maybe it 's one of those retirement things

#s162

#s163
