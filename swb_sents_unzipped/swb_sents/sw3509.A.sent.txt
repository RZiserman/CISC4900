So how do you feel about capital punishment

#s3
Right

#s4
you do n't think

#s12
I uh I have the same dilemma I think

#s13
Uh it 's you know it seems right sometimes

#s14
and then other times you do n't know

#s16
Uh

#s26
Right

#s28
Right

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
And also it does n't seem like it does that many harm

#s33
I mean sure their life is taken

#s34
but they 'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway

#s35
so I think sometimes they 'd prefer just to get it over with

#s38
so it 's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the con- for the you know what they 've done

#s43
Yeah

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Right

#s49
but then again also you ca n't bring back lives that have been taken anyway

#s50
so uh it 's

#s52
it does n't

#s53
it seems by that by

#s54
I do n't know

#s55
does n't ever really p- uh

#s60
Yeah

#s61
Right

#s62
It does n't bring back every

#s67
What state are you in

#s69
Oh really

#s71
In Dallas

#s74
Oh really

#s76
Uh right now I 'm in Utah

#s77
but I 'm from Plano Texas

#s80
So uh uh what are the laws like in Texas

#s91
Oh really

#s93
Uh-huh

#s97
Wow

#s103
I have n't

#s104
no

#s107
And they do it that way

#s112
Huh

#s116
Wow

#s117
I think they 're there

#s118
I think that capital punishment is is uh in t- in Utah also

#s119
I 'm not really familiar

#s122
Yeah

#s123
I am

#s125
So but I think they d-

#s126
a long time ago I I remember my dad was telling me this I think that uh they do it by like a bunch of men have guns

#s127
and one of them has the real gun in it

#s131
So they do n't know who killed

#s134
Right

#s138
Yeah

#s139
no

#s141
I know
