Uh did you watch the Bulls this morning

#s7
They won in a squeaker

#s8
They won by they won by two points

#s10
Uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter

#s11
and then they came back in the second half

#s12
and at the end I think they were uh looked they looked like they were closing it out

#s13
and then Detroit kept coming back

#s14
and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end

#s16
and uh I think the Bulls won by two

#s18
I think they do as a matter of fact

#s20
One of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an N B A record for seventy wins in a season

#s22
Yeah

#s23
they looked real good

#s24
and

#s30
Right

#s32
Yeah

#s33
well they they 're they 're balancing their attack

#s34
and I think they look like uh they 'll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson 's done with the Warriors

#s39
I saw the the second half of the game last night

#s40
and they were impressive

#s42
Billy Owens looks like he was

#s43
that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him

#s46
Well they traded away uh Mitch Richmond

#s47
or is it Tim Hardaway

#s48
One of the two uh who along with uh Chris Mullen was you know

#s49
though three were three of the best in the N B A

#s50
and and they made a heck of a threesome

#s52
and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens

#s53
and uh

#s55
Yeah

#s56
oh yeah

#s57
he 's really worked out well

#s58
They 've got th- the Warriors have got a team uh

#s59
and uh I think that will be real interesting to see what they can do

#s60
They 're ahead

#s61
and the Lakers are down I guess in fourth uh position in the west

#s62
and I do n't know

#s64
in the east I do n't know uh

#s65
is it Boston in uh first place

#s69
Boy they 've had a hard time

#s70
They said they 've lost a lot of squeakers

#s76
Yeah

#s78
How do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio

#s79
Do you for example like San Antonio in Dallas

#s84
So there is n't much crossover huh

#s85
y-

#s89
Yeah

#s91
Yeah

#s92
it 's true

#s93
because s- San Antonio is n't that close to you are they

#s96
No

#s98
Is it

#s99
Yeah

#s100
so it 's not something you 'd drive

#s102
Yeah

#s103
I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing

#s106
They 've done a good job

#s107
I mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly

#s111
Yeah

#s112
I mean that 's

#s114
I think the way it uh I think that 's the way it works now in basketball

#s115
You you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics

#s117
and

#s120
Well it MUMBLEx

#s123
Well yeah

#s126
Well I think you 're right

#s127
and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit

#s128
and I think those things do make a difference

#s129
and there are marquee players

#s130
And I think I think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be uh considered the likely favorites

#s132
I do n't know who would meet them in the west

#s133
Uh I do n't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year

#s134
They were so disap-

#s136
You know I was n't I I d- I watched only a few minutes of it

#s137
and I was n't paying attention

#s138
Uh and so I do n't know uh

#s140
But Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs

#s141
and
