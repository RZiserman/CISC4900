Ou- ou- our judicial system is in such total chaos

#s11
I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it

#s12
I mean when you have a man that 's signed a a a statement saying he 's guilty

#s13
we have a a family called All day family

#s14
They were all murdered

#s16
All the people signed confessions

#s17
they went to a trial by jury

#s18
They been trying these people now for twenty-two years ever since I was a child

#s20
And what they 've done is they 've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they 've done

#s21
has nothing to do with justice whatsoever

#s34
Uh that 's true

#s35
I I I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself

#s37
I I hold it in the utmost contempt

#s39
The uh d- my favorite is the police department

#s40
they 're not aimed at the criminal

#s41
The judicial system is aimed at the citizens

#s42
because you and I we have work schedules

#s43
we can be called at work

#s44
we have Social Security numbers

#s45
they can trace us down

#s46
we have telephones

#s47
then we have checkbooks

#s48
Criminals have none of these things

#s49
They 're real difficult to catch

#s50
and if they do catch them they do n't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check

#s52
So where do you think they target their efforts

#s55
They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals

#s57
You know that 's a

#s58
I 've nailed the problem down

#s59
but I

#s61
Yeah

#s62
I 'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about

#s63
I think to begin with you would h- you would have

#s64
like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical

#s65
yet you go out on the streets

#s66
and they 're giving speeding tickets

#s68
I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from

#s80
Now I firmly believe in that

#s82
because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney

#s84
And here 's this bum that did n't have a job

#s86
and he 's got a attorney that you and I could never afford

#s88
Who 's paying for that

#s91
Yeah

#s92
and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it

#s96
Yeah

#s97
well that 's another problem

#s98
I think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it

#s99
I mean they 're they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever

#s100
and with that type person running it I mean you you could expect that you
