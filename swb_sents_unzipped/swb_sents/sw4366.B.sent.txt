Well Julie uh are you in a situation where you 'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly

#s4
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s12
Is he able to uh still do everything himself pretty well

#s15
Oh yeah

#s19
Yeah

#s21
Uh-huh

#s23
Yeah

#s24
And I 'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f- grandfather 's feelings

#s25
Because uh I th- you know I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left

#s26
And and for for I 'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it 's like saying my life is over

#s28
and I 'm just here for the rest of the stay

#s29
And so I you know I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it 's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs

#s30
Yeah

#s32
they have can look after a lot of things

#s33
but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore

#s34
Uh I know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home

#s35
They generally were able to have someone care for them at home

#s36
and they died

#s37
But they were all goodness younger than your grandparents

#s38
Like they were in their eighties That type of thing

#s39
Uh but I did uh you know

#s40
I guess uh when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do take care of themselves physically Uh

#s42
And that 's that 's difficult part

#s43
Because I think what they often get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital

#s45
Uh I know like here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care MUMBLEx the care actually for the older people graded in level in four levels

#s46
And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care Generally are not able to look after this- themselves to very to a very great extent physically

#s47
Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer 's Disease or those or or physical and mental handicaps Uh you know where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind Even though it may be minimal

#s49
And uh but I think that it can be helpful in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need Uh

#s53
Yeah

#s54
I th- and I think it happens more in areas where it 's uh I guess uh a broad social medical system where uh you know there 's government medical care and that kind of thing

#s55
If it 's the lot where it 's funded by the individuals

#s56
and and I guess that 's sort of my lack of understanding

#s57
I think that a majority of the places in the U S uh you know there is some government aid available

#s58
but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay

#s60
And uh if you 're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely
