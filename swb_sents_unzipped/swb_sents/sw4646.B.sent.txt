#s2
No

#s3
But I my grandparents were looking into it before

#s4
so I know what they 've said

#s6
Uh-huh

#s13
Oh they thought it was too much of a bother

#s16
Right

#s17
If they 're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you 're going to have you know put in there too

#s19
Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still

#s21
They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her

#s22
but they wanted to be independent as well Have their own room

#s28
Uh-huh

#s35
Well a lot of it 's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help

#s37
They need health care

#s38
so they 're already ill before they go

#s40
That 's probably a large factor

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
Right

#s47
right

#s48
That 's what my grandparents

#s49
it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them

#s51
So that was their thinking

#s52
Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency

#s54
And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make So they would n't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time

#s56
I guess that 's a problem too for people Wait lists and all

#s59
That uh

#s60
you ca n't always get in when you want too

#s61
and of course you ca n't just sit around and wait

#s64
Yeah

#s65
And the money is also another issue How you 're going to pay for it

#s67
At that stage of life you only have so much money left

#s68
and I guess it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings

#s70
I mean it is kind of fair

#s71
but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise

#s73
So it 's another problem

#s75
Right

#s76
right

#s77
So it it 's just so complicated anymore I think

#s78
People outlive their savings

#s79
And with medicine being the way it is you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down

#s80
and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore

#s83
It 's just a shame that 's the way it has to be

#s84
I think the retirement home idea 's a nice idea

#s85
To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay

#s87
and cause like if your spouse died MUMBLEx all alone it 'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you To have friends
