#s2
Definitely

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Uh I have twice

#s9
It was a pretty wild experience

#s11
They were just you know small time cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know

#s13
They were civil

#s14
They were n't they were n't any criminal

#s18
Uh the jury it was uh let me see I think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people

#s20
so it was

#s21
they

#s22
and uh the one changed his vote at the end

#s24
So it became unanimous you know after they turned it in

#s26
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in

#s28
but it then became unanimous

#s31
Right

#s34
The the other case was just traffic

#s35
the

#s36
and you know it was seat belt law

#s38
and it it did n't even hardly go through

#s40
so

#s44
Yeah

#s47
Yeah

#s48
Well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though

#s54
I would n't think that it does I mean from from my from what I experienced in them

#s56
it did n't you know it did n't turn out the way I planned it I mean the way that I would think that it would go

#s58
Yeah

#s59
but it was you know it was

#s60
jury was unorganized

#s61
and it was it was just was n't organized enough for me

#s63
I 'm not used to it not being organized

#s64
and I just assumed that it would have been

#s68
That 's about what it was

#s73
Yeah

#s74
they well they picked one person

#s75
and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have

#s77
Yeah

#s78
it ended up working all right

#s80
Yes

#s85
I I do n't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what 's going on

#s88
Yeah

#s89
the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer that which was uh seemingly their property

#s92
It was on his property

#s95
Right

#s96
So they came to get it

#s98
And then when they came to get it well it was on the landlord 's property

#s99
and he would n't let them take it off

#s101
So and they are it was a double wide

#s102
so they 'd already taken it apart

#s104
So they left it there

#s106
and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it

#s108
So they were suing him for the money

#s109
and you know there 's no way they could because it it was the moving company
