Uh invasions of privacy

#s6
Uh what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things

#s8
All sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing

#s12
Um my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen MUMBLEx

#s13
just what went into the MUMBLEx

#s14
something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers

#s16
I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your your phone and and and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not

#s18
Um but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using

#s19
and uh and uh people businesses would be prohibited uh from calling for pers- for for business MUMBLEx selling you things

#s21
I 'm sure that 's true

#s23
Uh of MUMBLEx did too

#s24
I think I think government can do that now

#s25
is that right

#s27
And uh especially with with possibly children around

#s29
Uh that could could be useful protection

#s35
So uh I used to deal with

#s37
What are dialing services

#s39
Oh oh where people just just call you

#s43
And you and then what those problems has been eliminated

#s44
those problems used to be when I used a credit card they 'd want to have my phone number

#s47
And I did not like giving it out

#s48
I MUMBLEx gave out my work number

#s50
but I think I 'm not sure if it 's by law just

#s51
otherwise I think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number

#s53
How did Radio Shack work

#s59
Yes

#s60
that 's that 's that 's one solution

#s61
but you you you nonetheless often get get people calling you

#s63
Despite the fact that your number is unlisted

#s65
And you MUMBLEx actually have your number

#s66
or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours

#s68
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s73
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers

#s75
I 'll be thinking in mind the address is

#s76
um is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number

#s87
Huh Yeah

#s88
I do n't know

#s89
I think it 's gotten much worse the last few years

#s92
Maybe that 's just because I 've gotten on more lists

#s98
Yeah

#s99
Sell you magazines

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
I guess whatever is I just do n't give
