Okay

#s2
MUMBLEx I missed a part of it

#s3
We 're to talk about what lawns and gardens

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
I well

#s10
it 's it 's it 's very str- strange that I got this call because my wife just called me

#s11
I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn and you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden

#s13
this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall fall bulbs

#s15
Uh

#s21
Well that 's the way this was

#s22
The the petunias were really great

#s23
Our mums are are beautiful

#s25
Uh I do n't know if we I do n't think we 've had a frost up here

#s26
I 've been I was down in MUMBLEx for a week

#s27
so I do n't know what happened last week

#s29
uh but uh it seems like it 's I do n't know if it 's late

#s30
I 'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer

#s31
so I can get a lot of stuff down out here

#s33
Uh I I enjoy it

#s34
We came here we just moved into this well we moved in in November and put all all the landscaping in this this year

#s35
We came from nine years in a condo uh

#s36
and working in that condo you did n't have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to

#s38
so

#s40
Right

#s41
You know I ca n't

#s42
this is my third third house I think I 've owned um

#s43
but uh it 's interesting you know

#s44
the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling

#s45
and it sort of gets away from me if you 're not with it

#s47
So but uh I I enjoy most of it

#s48
and about this time of year there is it starts getting a little old

#s49
and I start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my

#s51
Well it is it is for me

#s52
because I 've been doing a lot of fertilizing

#s53
We had a terrible summer

#s54
we had a drought

#s56
and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing

#s57
and now it 's really growing

#s58
and I 'm trying to establish a good root root growth you know for the winter

#s62
Really

#s64
Uh

#s66
Oh really

#s68
Um

#s70
Oh yeah

#s72
yeah

#s73
I hear that from my brother-in-law lives in Plano

#s75
Yeah

#s76
Well he always

#s78
he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here

#s79
and then he calls us

#s81
yeah

#s82
it 's seventy degrees here in the sunshine

#s83
So

#s85
MUMBLEx

#s88
Uh-huh

#s90
Yeah

#s91
that is

#s92
I was you know I was like conditioned to it

#s94
they they have to be hardened to it

#s95
that 's that 's strange with me

#s96
You know you think Dallas you know almost semitropical you would n't have that kind of that kind of problem

#s97
but

#s101
Uh-huh

#s104
Really

#s105
oh do they

#s107
Uh-huh

#s109
I love

#s110
Yeah

#s111
I love the uh the landscaping

#s112
like I say my brother-in-law MUMBLEx

#s113
I get to Carrollton quite a bit

#s115
I go there on business

#s116
and I really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens

#s117
and Texas is D- Dallas is very nice

#s118
I really enjoy it there The landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing

#s119
very enjoyable gardens

#s121
and my wife and I

#s124
Well

#s126
Yeah

#s127
that we have you know

#s129
Ohio 's a very pretty state

#s130
We moved in seventy-six we moved to Chicago

#s131
we lived there for five years

#s132
and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt

#s133
uh we were coming in

#s134
and before the plane landed she looked out the window

#s135
and she said she said MUMBLEx there 's no trees down there

#s136
MUMBLEx this is Illinois

#s137
you 're not

#s138
And when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land

#s141
and now all of a sudden it was being developed

#s142
and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees
