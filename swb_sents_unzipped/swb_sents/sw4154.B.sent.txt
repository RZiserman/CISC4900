#s2
Well it looks like it 's just about as volatile as it usually is

#s4
What do you think Mark

#s9
Oh yeah

#s12
Uh-huh

#s13
And then we 'll see what happens when uh they 're not funded quite as much Or supplied with arms the same way

#s18
Uh-huh

#s19
Well I we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves

#s21
you know we s- kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them

#s23
But I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh Kuwait was uh the fact that they did not retaliate for the uh scud missiles that were uh launched there

#s26
That just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint

#s27
and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the U S

#s31
I see

#s33
Oh you do n't think they got the codes from the U S already

#s35
I see

#s37
That 's true

#s38
They can

#s39
yet they

#s41
Yeah

#s43
Well what do y-

#s44
what about this situation with the you know the uh continual uh harassment by Iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the uh arms inspectors have free access

#s48
Uh-huh

#s51
Huh yeah

#s52
okay

#s53
Sure

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Right

#s59
Uh-huh

#s61
Well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh you know move on into Kuwait and see what happens

#s63
Uh-huh

#s66
Right

#s68
Yeah

#s69
well may have been

#s70
You know I 'm not saying that that 's not the case

#s71
Uh

#s74
Right

#s76
No

#s78
No

#s79
it does n't look like we 're getting ready to do to do much more in there

#s81
Even at this point

#s83
Yeah

#s84
Well what about uh

#s85
do you have any any views on uh Israel 's relation to the U S

#s86
Do you think we ought to you know back off on our support of the country

#s87
or what do yo-
