Do you have any children

#s4
Twelve and sixteen

#s7
Well I have three

#s8
and uh they 're five and three and nineteen months

#s10
So we kind of got different ball game

#s11
but uh

#s13
What uh

#s14
do you feel like you have any time to spend with them

#s16
They 're probably at an age where they do n't want to spend any time with their parents

#s20
Right

#s24
Oh uh-huh

#s27
Right

#s29
Sure

#s31
Oh well that 's nice

#s33
You 're stuck together

#s35
No

#s38
I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part

#s41
Right

#s44
And so that kind of gives him uh time with his dad then

#s48
Gives him a little bit of that individual time

#s51
Right

#s52
and they want to be able to spend uh

#s54
Well I 've even noticed that with my five year old

#s55
She started kindergarten this year

#s56
and every day that she 's not at school uh she thinks we need to have someone over and play

#s59
and that kind of

#s62
yeah

#s63
it 's hard

#s64
I think uh I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should

#s66
I 'm more worried about Oh I did n't this done

#s67
I did n't get

#s68
the kitchen needs to be cleaned

#s70
this needs to be done

#s71
and and I need to re- remind myself to slow down

#s73
and it 'll still be there tomorrow

#s77
But that 's kind of hard to do you know

#s82
You do n't see yourself getting

#s84
Uh-huh

#s86
Right

#s90
Slow down a little bit

#s92
Oh uh-huh

#s95
You can do uh more than than when you travel

#s99
This is the first year we 're staying home too

#s100
and uh I think it 's going to be real quiet

#s101
but uh that 's an opportunity to get out the games

#s102
and

#s108
Right

#s109
Of co- of course

#s113
Oh yeah

#s119
Would n't take it apart after that

#s122
That 'd be kind of fun

#s126
Right

#s127
right

#s129
No

#s131
no

#s132
In fact in I think if people would learn to turn off the T V -s

#s133
and

#s136
I think that 's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family

#s140
usually people are not sitting in front of that

#s144
Yes

#s145
and you ca n't communicate while you 're doing that right

#s148
Whereas uh I 'm the type of person I could not sit

#s149
well I should n't say I could not

#s150
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something

#s157
Because they talk so much

#s158
is n't that the

#s162
You 're kind of like what are you talking about

#s163
and uh

#s166
You feel like you 're a little bit out of it do n't you

#s167
They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what 's

#
