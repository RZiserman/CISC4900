Uh a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either uh elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users

#s3
And uh I know the the government is uh you know gives drug tests an- to all new entrants all new appli- applicants coming into government

#s5
And and I quite frankly do n't see anything wrong with it

#s6
I I 'm I guess I 'm not a good civil libertarian

#s7
And and I I feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you 're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that 's difficult unless you really go into a deep background

#s8
Of course we 're

#s9
being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks

#s10
and and so uh but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that

#s13
And uh I have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to whatever it is to to you know break this uh activity

#s16
Of course if he 's fallen in love with drugs and there is n't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope

#s18
What 's your uh feeling

#s28
Uh-huh

#s30
Well I think uh the dr- the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that

#s34
Yeah

#s38
Well the thing of it is the the tha- tha- that that is uh uh in in many respects uh uh you know just just I think an over simplification

#s40
I I think there th- th- th- there 's so much criminal activity uh that people go into to to support drug habits

#s43
Yeah

#s44
You know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that

#s45
yeah

#s53
I I I must admit that

#s56
Yeah

#s59
Yeah

#s60
I I must admit that the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and and the costs to society

#s61
yeah

#s65
But I I I I think that that the that you know the being in law enforcement you know th- th- th- I I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it

#s66
And but but the uh uh I I really feel as though the interdiction effort is is

#s67
as soon as you you get rid of one goon that 's that 's that 's involved in drugs tha-

#s71
Yeah

#s72
and then another another one will jump up

#s74
But we we see

#s77
Yeah

#s78
A- a- as soon as we wind up uh uh you know for

#s79
well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand

#s80
but but people want to get get stoned

#s83
and I I do n't see that

#s87
Yeah

#s91
Uh-huh

#s97
Uh-huh
