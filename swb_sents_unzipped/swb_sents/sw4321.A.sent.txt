Well have you ever served on a jury

#s7
Well I was called

#s8
and then I was not chosen

#s14
Oh really

#s29
Well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that

#s34
Well I mean I think

#s35
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more uh tangible

#s36
or

#s41
Well do you think that that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up

#s46
No

#s47
I 'm not

#s53
Well I mean I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served

#s56
Say

#s57
but uh

#s58
and I also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that uh the just the process of picking jurors is not always objective
