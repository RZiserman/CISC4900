Okay

#s2
do you subscribe to magazines yourself

#s4
Oh I see

#s5
I get uh MCCALL 'S

#s6
Of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that 's my main line of interest

#s8
And then once in a while I 'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I do n't want to re- go back to work What I enjoy about staying home

#s11
And uh I read magazines mainly because they 're fast and if I want to relax while I watch T V

#s12
of course I 'm one of those that does two things at once

#s13
and uh I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL 'S

#s14
And I like them because they 're kind of short and to the subject

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
And then you stopped them all

#s23
I find that uh about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular

#s25
and then I kind of get turned off by it Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING

#s27
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when uh when I 'm really have time and I really want to read something you know

#s29
I do n't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with uh on a general basis

#s31
and we travel a lot

#s32
so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know different ones

#s35
And I get into uh newspapers

#s36
so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am

#s37
I 'm re- read it fast and put it down

#s42
Right

#s44
Well That 's what I do

#s47
You clip recipes

#s48
and you save them forever

#s49
and you never really use them

#s53
And then every so often you weed through them

#s54
and you think where did I ever put that recipe

#s56
But uh that 's mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this

#s58
I I subscribe like I said to a few

#s59
and once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands or something like that

#s61
But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what uh pertains to my daily life at the present time

#s67
Right

#s68
Well sometimes if you know if you 're in transportation in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that

#s71
But I think

#s72
and the idea is to is and

#s73
good I can just dump them at the other end

#s74
and I do n't have to carry them back with me

#s76
I do that when we travel

#s77
I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we

#s79
no matter what it is

#s80
air travel or anything

#s81
and I

#s85
Right

#s86
al- although now

#s89
That 's when you really have time

#s90
Now see your computer ones

#s91
I got into computer work somewhat uh

#s92
we have our own computer system at home

#s94
and I tried uh reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it

#s95
and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along

#s97
It was you know kind of a little bit more than what I needed

#s98
so I never did get into them

#s99
I when I bought the computer all of a sudden I was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail

#s100
I think they all that- thought well we have a live one

#s101
She 'll subscribe

#s103
But they were wrong

#s104
I never got into them

#s105
But but

#s106
Okay

#s108
All right I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point

#s110
It was nice talking with you

#s112
Okay

#s114
Uh-huh

#s115
Bye now
