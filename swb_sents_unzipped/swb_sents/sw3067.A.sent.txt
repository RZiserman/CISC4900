In my my uh father 's family we get together every year at a different location either Dallas or Oklahoma City

#s169
They had chosen Santa Barbara California for this summer and and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the Texas Oklahoma area

#s171
And uh so they cancelled that one and uh are looking next year bringing it back closer

#s172
but we have a letter a family letter that circulates

#s174
and it usually goes through me twice a year

#s175
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that 's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top

#s176
and then that 's the way it 's kept in order

#s177
And then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on

#s178
and when you meet them at the reunion you do not feel like I do not know anything about this person

#s179
You have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth

#s181
So you are kind of half way acquainted that way

#s183
And that that 's been a that 's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other I think

#s186
We tried to start that in my husband 's family

#s187
His mother 's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago

#s188
and I said well let 's start this letter

#s189
and it just never

#s190
my husband 's sisters started it and sent it to us

#s191
and that 's as far as it got

#s192
I sent it on to the next one

#s194
and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in Scottsdale Arizona for that family

#s196
We are real glad we got together because since that that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left

#s197
And the sister-in-law died

#s198
and the sister is in a nursing home

#s199
so we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
