#s1
Okay

#s2
well

#s4
All right

#s5
Um um well uh tell me about the car that you 've got

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s25
Well that 's very interesting

#s26
I 've had I 've had exactly the same experience with the one that I 've got

#s27
It 's a and surprisingly it 's also an eighty-four

#s29
and uh

#s31
Yeah

#s32
I 'm still here

#s33
Um I 'm sorry

#s34
what

#s36
Yes

#s37
it 's an L X

#s38
it 's not a hatchback

#s39
but it 's um it 's uh

#s42
Four door

#s43
yeah

#s45
and very very comfortable car

#s46
Big roomy trunk

#s48
uh and uh and very happy with it

#s49
and I must admit it 's you know

#s50
if if if uh my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town in and make you know brief trips and things like that I would very very seriously consider buying one

#s51
Uh I think they 're extraordinarily reliable cars

#s54
Um my my real concern with uh uh

#s55
why I 'm not sure I want to buy a Honda is because I have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road about once a month because I 'm divorced

#s56
and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina

#s58
and uh I drive down Interstate Ninety-five

#s59
and it 's just an absolutely wild highway

#s62
Yeah

#s63
and

#s66
Uh-huh

#s68
And you well you 've got it

#s69
and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine it 's very hard for me to imagine that that uh a Honda 's going to be as safe a car as as the one that I 've got my eye on which is a Volvo

#s72
In in fact quite frankly I 've owned a Volvo in the past

#s73
and uh I 've I 've

#s75
they 're expensive cars to keep up when they need service

#s76
but uh I 've found that I 've had a lot of luck with them

#s77
Uh course I 'm a mechanically inclined kind of person

#s78
and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth

#s79
And I guess that 's one thing that that recommends the Honda to a lot of people is is there 's just very little that you have to do under the hood

#s80
and uh

#s85
Oh I know

#s86
It 's really amazing

#s88
It 's uh

#s90
Absolutely

#s91
incredible

#s92
So um yeah

#s93
anyway I 've been looking at the prices of these cars and and so forth

#s94
and I think that it 's it 's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you 're willing to buy ones that are about the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own

#s98
and um

#s100
Well certainly some of the top end ones

#s101
You can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars

#s103
and uh we get you know

#s104
in the Washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here

#s106
so there 're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week

#s107
and I sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth

#s108
and so um anyway and that 's that 's the other thing is that I 've I 've never really been too terribly much of a new car person

#s110
I think I 've bought one or two new cars in my life

#s111
and I 've tended to um to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old

#s112
This Honda that I have I bought used

#s113
and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it

#s114
I 've just rolled seventy thousand miles

#s115
and it 's a seventy-four I mean an eighty-four

#s116
So

#s118
Yeah
