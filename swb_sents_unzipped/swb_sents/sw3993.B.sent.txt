#s5
Uh-huh

#s6
I really love the tole painting

#s7
Uh I have n't done any of the oil or watercolor

#s8
I would like to learn that someday

#s9
but right now my passion is tole painting

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Oh

#s16
It does

#s17
it is real time consuming

#s18
and

#s20
Uh mostly I have just given them away as gifts

#s22
Uh I 've done uh perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and oh on and on you know just things like that

#s23
but uh I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job

#s26
I just work at Stop and Shop out there in in Ogden

#s27
so

#s29
No

#s30
I 've wanted to do that uh but just have n't just have n't mass produced enough to do that

#s32
So I have five children of my own

#s33
so it 's

#s35
they they keep me busy

#s36
and tole painting is just a you know something I do in my spare time

#s37

#s41
Yes

#s42
