Uh I work for Georgia Tech

#s4
Yes sir

#s5
I work for the research facility

#s6
Uh and it 's it 's kind of small in a sense

#s7
but it it does have about uh I guess two thousand civil employees

#s9
And on a a scale I guess it 's still considered small

#s10
It just have a lot of different laboratories

#s12
The area I work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so

#s14
So that 's make up most of the laboratory

#s15
so from from that standpoint it 's pretty small it 's pretty small

#s17
What about yourself

#s21
Oh okay

#s24
Oh okay

#s25
I see

#s29
Oh okay

#s30
Right Uh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Right

#s36
Well those and probably the security aspect of it

#s38
Because a lot of time nowadays even though you 're working uh you 're treated

#s39
and it may not be true in every place

#s40
In a lot of cases I think you 're treated more like a number instead of a a person

#s42
Because when it come down to layoff they do n't really consider people and and you know their well being as far as you know how they going their next dollar going to come in How they going to pay their bills

#s43
They just lay them off

#s45
And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had uh

#s46
I think the company still exists

#s47
What they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know

#s49
That way that you know one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time

#s51
And uh you know I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better you know other than s- you know something like

#s52
unemployment is good

#s53
but I mean the company as a whole

#s54
because you as an employee

#s55
even the company is making money

#s56
they paying you a salary

#s57
but you are responsible for that company growth

#s58
You 're responsible also for helping that company get to the par- point that it 's at at making profits

#s59
So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than you know uh neglect or something like that

#s61
You know Because it 's not a person 's fault that you know people not buying or businesses are are not on the up and up all the time you know

#s62
I do n't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of com- a company situation

#s65
Well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you 're going to lay off these ten people Uh for the bad times of the company

#s67
What about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well

#s69
You know In that standpoint

#s72
Ye- yes

#s73
I do

#s75
I really do

#s76
I think it 'd be better that way

#s77
and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that MUMBLEx that there are problems

#s79
and you know there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time

#s82
You know That 's just that 's my views you know

#s87
Right

#s88
Right

#s89
Right

#s92
Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know Because the way it is a person really do n't have a chance
