Uh I do n't know

#s3
I 've got mixed feelings about the topic

#s6
No

#s7
Okay

#s12
Well

#s14
Well I do n't believe in drugs or alcohol

#s15
but if you 'll remember when the teachers had to take the T CAT they were talking about drug testing us

#s18
and we were laughing that we 'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine

#s20
and we found it belittling

#s22
Yeah

#s26
That 's true

#s28
But then you know at the same token I 'm not against

#s29
because I look at airline pilots bus drivers you know people that really have other peoples ' lives in their hands truck drivers

#s34
it 's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol

#s37
And

#s39
You know in those areas I really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know house

#s53
Yeah

#s54
I think it 's just like anything else a new concept you know

#s55
as I said if I have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted

#s62
But at the same token in education we ca n't do drug random drug testing on kids

#s65
you know I mean their rights are protected

#s68
What

#s69
well but why if you 're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids when we see them and they 're you know under the influence

#s75
That 's true

#s78
It 's three minutes

#s79
and the clicker comes in when it 's time to

#s81
Yeah

#s83
No

#s85
Well do we agree or unless it 's not me

#s87
You know here we go again I mean

#s90
yeah you know

#s92
I believe that truck drivers and people that have

#s93
even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk

#s95
and there was an incident in my children 's high school where a teacher stayed drunk

#s97
Uh-huh

#s99
And he

#s102
Uh well no

#s103
you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else

#s107
and uh

#s108
Yeah

#s109
well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation

#s111
It was on the news tonight

#s117
Yeah

#s118
Then I think you know if if it came push came to shove I 'd probably be drug tested you know

#s121
because it does you know

#s123
Yeah

#s124
because you know as I say I 'm sitting there fussing and fussing

#s125
and yet I know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as you know I presume out

#s128
Uh-huh

#s130
And you know my children brought it to my attention

#s131
I never was there to see it

#s133
Uh-huh

#s135
And that 's not giving a good example to students
