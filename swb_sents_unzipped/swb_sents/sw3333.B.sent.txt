#s4

#s26
Right

#s27
especially uh you since you 're in the same metroplex you know

#s28

#s34
and

#s36

#s38
not that I 'm aware of

#s40
I just heard you know last week at that one school they started putting them in because there was that one shooting

#s42
so um

#s44

#s61
and it just continues to get worse

#s65
Yeah

#s67

#s69
Yeah

#s70
that 's

#s71
I thi-

#s72
I agree

#s73
I think that 's where it stems from is that

#s74
and um you know you 've got a lot of a lot more women that are working nowadays that are n't home with the children

#s78
and that may impact it as well
