#s2
Well unfortunately very little

#s3
Uh much less than what I need to

#s9
Well I uh am an assistant teacher and uh in business technology

#s10
and I 've I think the most exercise I 've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids ' questions

#s11
It keeps me pretty busy

#s12
but it 's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going

#s14
And uh you know it really

#s15
exercise is so important

#s17
And I realize that

#s24
When you uh exercise what do you do

#s25
Do you do it at home or a club

#s26
or

#s33
I got a hold of uh Richard Simmons ' tape uh

#s35
what is it uh

#s36
I ca n't even think of the name of it right offhand with the oldies

#s38
Sweating with the to the oldies

#s39
yeah

#s40
and that 's not bad

#s42
That 's pretty upbeat

#s43
so you know I every once in a while I 'll put the cassette in and go with it

#s45
Not often enough to have a routine

#s48
My little Schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her

#s50
But uh I do n't know

#s51
by the time I get home all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer

#s52
and my fingers exercise more than anything now

#s58
Yes

#s59
Uh do you ever ride a bike or anything like that

#s65
Here about the the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk uh

#s67
Because they 're enclosed

#s68
and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter

#s74
And it 's safe

#s76
That 's uh you know inside the mall

#s77
may be not safe going to the parking garage

#s80
I know a doctor once told me it it

#s81
a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is

#s90
The uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with

#s91
and the water takes the resistance

#s93
Right

#s94
and you do n't get the soreness

#s95
I 've I 've done some water exercises

#s96
but our pool is not is not heated

#s97
so it 's

#s100
Summertime only

#s103
You do n't go out when it 's twenty some odd degrees go out to the swimming pool

#s106
Hot tubs are not uh not too bad

#s107
but

#s110
So what part of Mississippi are you from

#s112
Whereabouts is that

#s116
Oh

#s117
and you do have cold weather down there

#s121
Ours started Thanksgiving

#s123
And uh from there just well

#s124
today was pretty

#s125
but uh oh Sunday the snow and ice came in

#s127
And uh there was no exercise
