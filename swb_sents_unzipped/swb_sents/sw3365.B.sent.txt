#s4
Hi

#s6
Uh yeah

#s7
I think so

#s10
Okay

#s11
Well what did you have for lunch

#s14
Oh

#s17
Oh

#s18
Well that 's interesting

#s19
Okay

#s20
So our topic is is food today

#s21
is that

#s23
Okay

#s25
Okay uh

#s26
do you want me to go first

#s28
Okay

#s29
If I was having a dinner party I would probably um have some um some uh um some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and um probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some uh uh salsa and chips around and peanuts

#s30
And then I would have um let 's see I usually have like a little theme when I have a dinner party

#s31
so Um I would have maybe um

#s32
say if it was like Greek night or something um maybe um on the barbecue we 'd put uh cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek And um like a shish kabob and um mushrooms and tomatoes and onions

#s36
and then we 'd have um like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad

#s38
And um let 's see what else

#s39
Um maybe some rolls and um I guess some uh some rice or something like that

#s40
How does that sound

#s43
Yeah

#s44
Um yeah

#s45
that would take some planning

#s46
but

#s51
That 's right

#s54
Well that sounds good too

#s55
I have um I have three kids

#s57
so um when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs

#s58
and um usually we just have very plain kind of you know interesting not very interesting meals Pizza and that all

#s60
so once in a while when we do something like that it 's kind of fun

#s61
but it 's not a not a regular thing

#s63
Um Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes

#s65
is that it

#s66
Okay

#s69
Okay

#s70
Um let 's see now

#s71
wh-

#s72
okay

#s73
so you would have a barbecue wouldn-

#s75
Uh-huh

#s78
Oh sure

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
Oh that sounds wonderful

#s87
Uh-huh

#s92
Uh-huh

#s94
Oh you are in New York right now

#s96
Oh

#s97
I 'm I 'm in Texas

#s98
I did n't know this was all from all over the whole country

#s101
Oh I see

#s104
And I 'm fr- originally from Long Island

#s106
Yes

#s107
and now where are you in New York

#s109
Oh upstate

#s112
Oh okay

#s113
Oh okay

#s114
Is that where you you are originally from around there

#s116
Oh okay

#s118
Oh wow

#s119
That 's interesting

#s120
Okay

#s121
let 's see

#s122
Um well I like to have um sometimes when I have a dinner party I 'll have um everybody bring something

#s124
and that 's real interesting because then you get different um different kinds of foods and new recipes

#s125
and um uh sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like

#s127
and get the recipe from them or whatever

#s128
And we are just getting interested in in Mexican food

#s129
because here in Texas they have lots of really good Mexican restaurants

#s131
and um we 're we 're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could

#s133
do you know what a fajita is

#s136
Yeah

#s138
Okay

#s139
Yes

#s140
They have some delicious delicious things

#s141
and I um

#s142
since I always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts

#s144
and you boil them

#s145
maybe like four chicken breasts

#s146
and you boil them until they are cooked

#s147
Maybe like thirty minutes

#s149
and then you debone them and and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled

#s150
and you take um s- little bit maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr- in a big frying pan And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt
