Well the types of vacations that I usually take

#s2
I usually come back more tired after my vacation then I do you know before I take it

#s3
Um I need to definitely take a vacation where all all I do is rest

#s4
And I guess to do that I 'd probably have to take it at home

#s6
But um the vacation spots that I like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida

#s7
I enjoy the beach

#s9
Antibeach

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
Uh-huh

#s23
Right

#s28
Uh-huh

#s31
You might be like I am

#s32
I enjoy I enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas

#s33
but I really do n't like to get in the water the ocean

#s34
I prefer a swimming pool

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
Right

#s43
I can understand that

#s46
Uh-huh

#s48
That would be nice

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
I know I 've taken several vacations to Colorado

#s52
and I used to live in Colorado oh sometime ago for a couple of years

#s53
and I really enjoyed that

#s58
Uh-huh

#s62
Yeah

#s63
I 've never been up to the Yellowstone area

#s64
So

#s67
That 's right

#s68
That 's right

#s69
You got that

#s72
Uh-huh

#s74
Uh-huh

#s75
Uh-huh

#s79
Well you have you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then

#s82
Right

#s84
That 's right

#s86
Right

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s89
Right

#s90
Uh-huh

#s93
Uh-huh

#s95
It would be sort of

#s96
I feel like it would be confining

#s98
You know I would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself

#s103
Uh-huh

#s108
Yes

#s109
I I agree

#s110
I can I can do that too

#s111
and uh you know I think if I had if I had the money I would probably go to Europe every year

#s112
Because you know I think that they have they have it all over there in just a few tiny two two miles

#s114
You know there 's mountains

#s115
and there 's beaches

#s116
and it 's all right there

#s117
So

#s123
Uh-huh

#s125
Oh

#s127
Right
