#s1
All right

#s2
and and your occupation is teaching

#s4
Substitute teacher

#s6
Yes

#s7
it is

#s8
it is

#s11
Right

#s12
Well I was just trying to make an introduction here

#s14
But oh and and I have n't told you I 'm going to be at a different school this year now

#s16
I 've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron

#s18
Right

#s19
I

#s20
well not really

#s21
I 've got the every day I 've got to uh read to kindergartners

#s22
so I 'm going to be down on the floor with them

#s23
I 've got about forty kindergartners I 'm going to be doing working with every day for uh you know a half hour

#s24
So I 'll be I 'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because I 'm I 'm if I 'm going to be down on the floor messing with them I 'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses

#s26
Right

#s27
Well of course you 've been at Clark enough that you know it 's always cold

#s29
But you do n't know uh I guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you 've been there

#s32
Subtract

#s33
Right

#s35
I I think some of the dress codes are different at different schools

#s36
That 's one of things one of the things I ask about you know whether whether she would allow slacks

#s37
and she said she does n't have a problem with that

#s38
she just did n't like sloppy dressing

#s40
And and I said well you know that was okay

#s41
And I 'm

#s42
basically I just you know I wear slacks year round except every about once a week I try to wear a skirt

#s43
And and in the winter you know I just add a maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer And add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer

#s45
That 's about

#s46
I do n't I do n't really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and you know look really

#s50
Yeah

#s52
Right

#s54
And you never know that though sometimes when you 're going in do you

#s57
Right

#s58
right

#s60
Right

#s61
On what

#s62
Thursd- Thursday

#s66
Right

#s67
right

#s68
So that would kind of give you a a clue I guess

#s69
and and sometimes you get the long term stuff

#s70
so you 're aware ahead of time of what 's going on

#s72
That

#s73
so that 's

#s74
and I do n't know you know

#s75
I I think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know

#s76
Are

#s77
they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties

#s78
and there can be no blue jeans worn

#s79
and

#s80
because some of the teachers I know wear uh dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they 've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease

#s82
and uh you know they 'll wear it with a nice top

#s83
And and uh I do n't know that that looks that bad

#s84
But if you 're going to tell the kids they c- have to dress up I guess you can tell the teachers that too

#s89
Uh-huh

#s92
Uh-huh

#s96
Right

#s97
Right

#s98
right

#s100
Yeah

#s101
there 's a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others

#s103
Right

#s106
Right

#s107
Well and you always

#s108
course it 's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today

#s109
or there there 's There 's usually yeah there 's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen

#s112
and I I do n't know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or Eng- you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie

#s113
I

#s114
some of those male coaches that might really

#s117
Right

#s118
and a T-shirt

#s119
Right

#s120
That I did n't ever understand

#s121
I mean we 've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period

#s122
so

#s125
Whether

#s129
Change then

#s130
Well see that 's what I would think

#s132
That 's what I would think

#s135
Right

#s136
Course we had had one coach one period he 'd teach P E and the next period Health and then a period of P E

#s138
and and that 's hard

#s140
You know so he just left warm-ups on

#s141
but but uh no

#s142
I think really probably they could they could uh really

#s143
and I do n't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids

#s144
I guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top

#s145
and

#s147
You do n't think so

#s154
Well some of them yes they do

#s155
and and it 's not at some of the private schools

#s157
but even there 's a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that

#s160
Uh-huh

#s161
Well I I think it would make a difference at school

#s162
I I do n't think we should be spending time saying somebody 's wearing torn clothing or wearing sh- too shorts too short

#s163
or they 've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know

#s164
I mean it 's a lot of trouble to to take care of that

#s166
And of course the kids say then why bother

#s167
just let me wear what I want

#s168
And and yet we ca n't to that either

#s169
I 'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they 've got to wear a button down shirt You know

#s170
that would that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them

#s171
But if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted

#s172
and

#s175
And then the girls

#s177
Right

#s180
I do n't

#s181
no

#s182
not in Plano

#s185
They may get a-

#s187
but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there

#s190
Highland Park 's thinking about going that route

#s192
So it

#s193
and then I think that 's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do

#s197
Yeah

#s198
I agree with you on
