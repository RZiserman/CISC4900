I almost never watch T V news

#s9
I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio

#s11
Uh it 's a local radio station

#s12
It 's called uh K L I F cliff

#s17
No

#s18
No

#s24
Well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news

#s26
and occasionally in the morning I 'll pick up something like uh C N N or that

#s27
but I hate watching the like ten o'clock news

#s28
or

#s31
Yeah

#s32
we have a lo- well we have uh DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas

#s34
We read I read it pretty much from cover to cover

#s40
The TIMES HERALD went out of business here

#s42
and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper

#s45
Uh financial trouble

#s49
Oh when did it happen

#s51
I guess they closed down about three months ago

#s54
So how do you keep up

#s58
Yes they 're very voluminous

#s64
So there really is only one major L A now

#s74
Yeah

#s80
I used to read TIME magazine a lot

#s81
but I do n't read it much anymore

#s85
And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what 's going on in our little community Because we do n't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS

#s92
Now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section

#s94
And it 's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what 's going on in Plano

#s95
But it 's still not an awful lot of news

#s100
Oh I would imagine in uh you know in in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the sub- suburbs

#s101
and of course they tend to cover the county

#s102
and we 're not in Dallas county

#s103
so they tend to ignore places outside of the county

#s109
Yeah
