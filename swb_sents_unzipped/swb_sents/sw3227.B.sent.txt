What kind of music do you like

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even

#s19
I do n't think they have a whole lot to say even

#s21
Yeah

#s22
I guess

#s24
Uh-huh

#s26
Do you like rap

#s32
Yeah

#s34
that kind I kind of like

#s36
Some of it is kind of pointless

#s39
yeah

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
Yeah

#s46
yeah

#s49
Yeah

#s53
I guess I do n't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times

#s55
Um I 'm with you though

#s56
I like classical

#s58
um I do n't like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway

#s59
I like easy listening just kind of you know

#s60
I guess I do n't care much for rock and roll any more

#s61
I used to like it all right

#s62
but I do n't really care to listen to it any more for some reason

#s63
Um let 's see

#s64
Country western uh I 'm not quite as big on that

#s65
Some of it 's okay uh

#s68
yeah

#s70
Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess

#s71
so

#s73
Yeah

#s75
a lot of them sound uh really similar

#s76
yeah

#s79
Yeah

#s82
Um

#s84
Well that 's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes too I guess

#s85
They do n't really

#s86
has kind of the same sound over and over

#s87
and the other thing I do n't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you ca n't understand what the lyrics are

#s89
you ca n't understand what they 're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them too

#s92
Yeah

#s94
Yeah

#s95
earlier things
