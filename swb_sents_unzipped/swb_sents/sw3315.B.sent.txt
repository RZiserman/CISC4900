#s29
I guess we 're recording now

#s32
What are your favorite television shows

#s34
Oh really

#s38
Oh I love that show

#s41
Yes

#s42
that is great

#s46
Oh I heard they just canceled that

#s48
I read in today 's paper they just canceled that show

#s53
Have you seen the show it 's it 's new this year called HOME FRONT

#s56
Oh it 's it 's really good

#s57
It 's uh I think it 's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven

#s59
and it 's set in post World War Two times

#s60
and it 's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone 's going through

#s61
It 's really interesting

#s63
It 's kind of like a s- a nighttime soap opera type thing

#s65
It is

#s66
it 's a good it 's really well written

#s70
Uh I do n't even know to tell you the truth

#s73
Uh I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE

#s77
Oh

#s78
I did watch soap operas

#s79
but I work full-time now and ca n't catch those anymore Except when I 'm home sick

#s81
and now when I watch them I think why did I ever watch those

#s83
They 're stupid

#s85
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day

#s87
But not anymore

#s90
Oh uh tonight I 'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS

#s92
Yes

#s93
I like that show

#s95
And if I can stay up late enough I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then

#s97
And right now we 're watching a Penn State football game because that 's where we live

#s99
So

#s101
It 's exciting

#s102
we 're winning

#s103
so that 's really exciting

#s107
Uh-huh

#s110
Yes

#s111
we watch C N N in morning while we 're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast

#s113
We 'll catch our news that way

#s114
Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather 's going to be like

#s118
Lately I have n't been catching it because of my work schedule

#s120
Uh I ca n't remember the last time I saw it

#s121
It 's been a while

#s124
I do n't know

#s125
sometimes they come on and and say

#s127
Well today on C N N they were talking about something like this about uh learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that 's going on which is kind of what we 're doing helping them get a data base for words

#s129
It was really interesting

#s132
Do you work for Texas Instruments

#s136
Oh that 's nice

#s139
Sure

#s140

#s141
and we thought well maybe they work from for Dallas
