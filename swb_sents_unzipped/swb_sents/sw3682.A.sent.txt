#s3
Okay

#s4
Um well I like to cook um

#s6
but I do n't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um uh it 's too much pressure You know

#s9
if I have people over for dinner I like it to be nice and relaxed

#s13
Yeah

#s14
And so I do n't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out

#s17
Yeah

#s19
Exactly

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s27
Uh-huh

#s29
Uh-huh

#s30
you 'd just do it

#s32


#
Yeah

#s37
Uh-huh

#s41
Um Boy I like that

#s43
Yeah

#s44
well I 'm planning a

#s45
and naturally this is appropriate because I 'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night

#s48
So Tuesday night there 'll be eight people here altogether

#s50
Oh yeah

#s51
uh-huh

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Yeah

#s57
that 's fun

#s58
Uh-huh

#s60
Yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s64
that 's a good idea

#s67
Yeah

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
yeah

#s73
Uh-huh

#s75
Uh-huh

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Yeah

#s84
that 's good

#s85
Well one of my favorites if I do n't want to have other people bring stuff I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice

#s88
It 's very easy to

#s90
You do n't like it

#s92
Oh you do

#s93
okay

#s94
yeah

#s95
I have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken

#s96
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan

#s97
you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it

#s99
and and you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over

#s100
and you can put mushrooms in if you want

#s101
and then you just

#s103
Yeah

#s104
over uncooked rice

#s106
and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven

#s107
and it just

#s109
It fluffs up

#s110
and it 's really moist

#s113
Uh-huh

#s114
wow

#s115
yeah

#s121
Uh-huh

#s122
Yeah

#s125
Well I 'll keep that one in mind

#s127
Yeah

#s130
Yeah

#s132
Uh-huh

#s133
Yeah

#s134
you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner

#s136
or you know semi MUMBLEx

#s138
Yeah

#s140
Yeah

#s141
You put in um

#s143
let 's see

#s144
what was it

#s145
three quarters of cup of rice

#s146
or

#s148
It depends on

#s149
you can really vary it

#s151
But you have to put the water in proportionally

#s152
I ca n't remember

#s153
I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth

#s158
Yeah

#s159
MUMBLEx flavor

#s160
Uh-huh

#s161
Yeah

#s163
Uh-huh

#s165
Um let 's see

#s166
I think it was an hour

#s167
I 've done it in the microwave so often lately because it 's it 's really easy

#s169
Yeah

#s170
But I think it 's about an hour

#s172
Or maybe it 's only half hour

#s173
Um you just

#s174
until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone You know before it gets overdone

#s178
Yeah

#s180
Um I 'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster

#s184
Yeah

#s185
I liked your idea too there

#s190
Uh-huh

#s192
Yeah

#s193
Uh-huh

#s197
Uh-huh
