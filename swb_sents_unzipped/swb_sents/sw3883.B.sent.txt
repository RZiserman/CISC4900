#s3
Well you know it depends upon our weather here You know

#s4
today was a beautiful day

#s5
it was like uh uh summer day

#s6
It was seventy degrees

#s7
so so I dressed in uh uh a light weight skirt

#s9
it 's a uh ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it

#s11
Because I had some appointments at the office today some interviews

#s12
and so I had to dress up anyway

#s13
and then I wore heels you know

#s15
But when it rains a lot which is has been doing here a lot lately uh very often you know wear uh pants and boots you know

#s17
So how do you dress

#s19
Okay

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s26
I I can see

#s27
I I 've been a teacher

#s28
so has my daughter

#s29
and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring

#s32
That 's right

#s34
That 's right

#s35
and it always makes you feel like you 're a bigger person than the kids right

#s38
Yeah

#s39
I do too

#s40
So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades uh older grades I had to wear heels

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Of course we wear uh an unlined boots you know

#s50
it has a heel on it

#s51
They 're the kind of boots that I wear to work

#s52
and we wear them you know

#s53
they 're a leather boot that you wear

#s54
as I said they have a regular heel on them high heel

#s56
And they wear them we wear them a lot with shirts and things

#s57
Uh it 's kind of a

#s58
I ca n't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots

#s59
They 're not a cowboy boot

#s60
but they 're just a real pretty boot

#s61
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain

#s63
As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I 'm interviewing a parent of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know and look like I 'm a business person You know because the children will tease about where 's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often you know

#s69
Of course you probably wear coats a lot

#s73
Oh my goodness

#s74
so then you had to

#s78
Yes

#s79
Then things improved

#s80
right

#s83
But of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know you know

#s85
and uh that 's very seldom

#s86
we it depends upon our winter

#s87
We have a few days you might wear a coat winter coat you know

#s88
but most of the time you can wear a sweater

#s89
and we just do n't wear coats much

#s90
We often laugh about even when it turns chilly

#s91
We 're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we 're so used to running around like that

#s95
It 's really different

#s96
Let 's put it that way

#s97
Are you not teaching anymore

#s101
I see

#s103
Oh so you do n't wear heels anymore I 'll bet

#s106
Yeah

#s107
uh-huh

#s108
More practical

#s112
When you were teaching did you ever have uh uh a blue jean day or anything like that

#s115
Yeah well

#s117
I know that some of the schools they have uh country western day or something like that one you know or tacky day

#s118
and I always thought it was kind of out of got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too

#s121
It 's all right for the students

#s122
they look tacky a lot

#s123
but I did n't think teachers should you know

#s126
Yeah

#s127
Do you like uh uh Iowa

#s130
Where did you live before

#s133
Oh well that 's quite a change from California to Utah
