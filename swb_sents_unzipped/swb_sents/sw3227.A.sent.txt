Okay well um

#s3
I um I was thinking about it for a long time

#s4
and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music

#s5
Um I do n't have a whole lot of dislikes

#s6
I um like jazz um especially the blues

#s7
and uh I like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from Bach and and Beethoven and Chopin and um just in general everything

#s9
Um I enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh

#s11
Right

#s12
right

#s13
Uh well that gets

#s14
some of the punk um when I was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music

#s15
and uh a lot of it is has a lot to say or some of it has a lot to say

#s16
the music does

#s17
the lyrics do

#s18
but the the actual

#s20
Uh well it it 's it 's it really expresses some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music

#s23
um but as far as a musical art form I just do n't see a whole lot of art to it

#s25
Um

#s27
Um some of it um

#s28
it depends

#s29
I like uh the rap the two types of rap I like or I enjoy to listen to

#s30
and one is the the rap that is just funny um

#s31
and they usually do a lot of satire

#s33
um

#s35
Right

#s37
Right

#s38
the monotonous the monotonous

#s40
no

#s41
that 's not

#s42
I do n't enjoy that at all when they 're just talking about well I 'm better than you and blah blah blah

#s44
I do n't like that

#s47
I like the funny satire

#s48
and then some of it is some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in urban society

#s50
It really does

#s51
It talks about um race relations and police relations

#s52
and um that that

#s54
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s66
Yeah

#s67
that 's that 's about my opinion of that

#s69
It 's it 's okay um

#s72
Um The thing about country western that I do n't enjoy is is does n't seem to be any imagination behind it

#s74
the one country and western song sounds like every other country and western

#s77
and so the the musicians do n't get to really get into their music

#s78
They just play a certain number of chords

#s80
the drummer plays a certain beat

#s81
and you have a country and western song

#s83
and

#s88
Um Right

#s90
Yeah

#s91
And I ca n't say that I like a lot of the modern the very very modern uh rock and roll

#s93
but I I definitely I really enjoy the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies rock and roll

#s96
and uh I really enjoy especially the sixties
