Okay

#s2
So Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have

#s10
Right

#s11
That 's uh sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have

#s13
I am single

#s14
so I guess

#s15
I do n't know if that 's an excuse for not having a tight budget

#s17
but I basically

#s19
Right

#s20
I do n't need to

#s21
I am the only that I have to keep track of

#s22
so it makes it a little bit easier

#s24
Uh and also I you know I try to save a certain amount each month as well

#s26
and uh I try to try to have an idea of what my expenses are

#s27
and I am pretty consistent from month to month

#s29
and uh whenever uh I need to uh whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it

#s42
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

#s51
Right

#s53
Yeah

#s54
That 's

#s55
I guess I kind of do a similar thing More uh medium or longer range

#s56
I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for

#s57
Like I am

#s58
probably within a year I would like to buy a new car

#s60
So I kind of have a an amount in my mind

#s61
and I am making every effort to to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever

#s65
Right

#s72
Uh-huh

#s76
Huh

#s77
Right

#s79
Right

#s80
Have you thought about uh leasing

#s84
I see

#s87
Right

#s89
But if you are rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that

#s93
You know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off

#s95
Of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself

#s102
That 's right

#s103
Yeah

#s104
mine 's uh seven years old

#s105
and I think last year was that was a rough year for it

#s106
I had a number of expenses

#s108
But uh I am hoping that most of them were just kind of uh you know

#s109
the

#s110
as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that

#s111
So I just went through that whole set last year

#s113
I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again

#s116
Right

#s117
Right

#s118
What line of work are you in
