Okay

#s3
Universal health insurance

#s4
right

#s6
Uh Well I think universal health insurance like national health like what Canada has

#s7
Is that what you 're you 're thinking the subject is about

#s12
Did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject

#s14
Yeah

#s16
Uh the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is uh going to begin testing a program a state funded program for citizens of those two states

#s17
and there 's fourteen other uh states that are considering it Least according to the article in the paper this morning

#s18
I think it 's a trend that 's that 's that 's uh probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need

#s19
It 's getting to a point that you have to have it

#s20
you have to have some form of health insurance

#s22
Extremely expensive though

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
Well that 's the thing you know

#s28
uh unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are are paying for the people that do n't have health insurance

#s31
Yeah

#s32
I do n't think you uh

#s34
Yes

#s35
I do

#s37
Uh through my company

#s38
yes

#s39
But I have been in a situation uh recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year

#s40
and my wife developed cancer

#s41
We did n't have any insurance

#s43
And it was a go to Parkland type situation

#s46
Uh because it was a life threatening situation it was very good

#s47
Uh as it as it turned out one of the top uh people or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland

#s49
No

#s50
it 's not free

#s51
but uh It 's it 's a situation that because I did n't have any insurance and I was on unemployment it was paid by the county

#s54
I had a bad experience as it turned out

#s55
Uh I was fortunate that there was Parkland

#s57
Uh no

#s58
she passed away

#s60
That 's all right

#s62
That happens

#s65
Yeah

#s66
but in any event uh I 'm in favor of national health If I had to vote for it

#s69
Oh is that right

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
Uh-huh

#s76
Well I when I grew up and

#s77
I grew up in south central Kansas uh

#s78
we had

#s79
and my mom worked for the health department the county health department

#s80
and we had x-rays every year

#s81
we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least

#s82
Uh we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff

#s84
And uh when my children were growing up we did n't have that

#s85
We had to pay for it which I was n't opposed to paying for it

#s86
I had the money to pay for it

#s87
but I 'm sure that there were people that do n't

#s91
Uh-huh

#s96
Did not know that

#s100
Uh-huh
