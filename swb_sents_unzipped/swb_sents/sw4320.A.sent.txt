#s1
Okay

#s3
Well needless to say here in Washington D C this is the war zone

#s4
Uh D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital

#s5
It 's uh it 's really bad here

#s6
Uh for example the uh local high school uh they 've already found two students with sawed off shotguns

#s8
and they 're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things

#s9
So

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Uh-huh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s19
right

#s20
That 's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups I guess

#s21
and uh

#s23
Now the

#s24
interestingly enough I do n't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few Most of them centered around uh drug territory

#s27
And so they 're protecting their economic interests I guess

#s29
And uh nowadays the latest thing I 've I 've read about in the paper here that they 're doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house

#s31
Yeah

#s32
that 's the uh latest thing

#s33
That way there 's no damage to the car or anything

#s34
They just wait for you to show up after they 've picked out which one they want

#s36
Uh-huh

#s37
Right

#s38
Just wait for you to drive to your house

#s39
you get out

#s40
and they get in

#s41
off they go with your car

#s43
So it 's

#s44
uh I think they call it car jacking around here

#s48
Uh-huh

#s49
yeah

#s50
that 's kind of the latest thing

#s51
but every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides

#s52
so it 's uh it 's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we 're not from around here

#s53
we 're from uh I 'm from Ohio

#s54
and my wife 's from Florida

#s55
so

#s57
And we 've just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment

#s58
so this is a whole new thing for for us to to have to put up with

#s59
and it 's uh really scary sometimes

#s62
Right

#s63
And it 's pretty bad when they 're using metal detectors in school

#s65
and uh of course the mayor uh of D C is having a real problem uh trying to

#s66
what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like D C where it 's a way of life for everybody

#s67
It 's uh I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem

#s68
I do n't know what what the solution is

#s69
Uh there 's no way they can stop the drugs

#s70
and that 's what 's causing all the killing

#s73
Uh-huh

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Uh-huh

#s78
Right

#s80
And they see all their friends and neighbors uh

#s82
Yeah

#s83
and their friends are driving Mercedes

#s84
and so it 's actually

#s85
they grow up with that as their way of life

#s86
and uh I think uh to a large extent they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised

#s89
Right

#s90
exactly

#s91
so maybe it 's the law that wrong in their eyes

#s92
and they they say well it 's it 's the law that 's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life

#s94
so I do n't know

#s95
it 's

#s96
I 'm glad it 's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it 's not easy

#s99
Uh-huh

#s101
Right

#s103
They 've always been with us

#s107
Uh-huh

#s108
Uh-huh

#s110
Right
