#s2
Oh okay

#s4
Okay

#s5
we can start off there

#s6
Let 's just get started

#s8
If you do n't want to you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it

#s12
Right

#s15
Yep

#s17
So so you think uh I think a short work week is real nice

#s18
Uh I have a thirty-seven hour work week

#s19
How about you

#s23
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s29
Right

#s37
Yeah

#s38
it all makes sense to me

#s39
Although there may be more crime I mean if people have more leisure time

#s40
It 's not clear

#s41
And that

#s43
Yeah

#s45
Uh-huh

#s51
Right

#s56
Uh-huh

#s59
Right

#s60
So

#s63
Right

#s68
Yeah

#s72
Yeah

#s75
Uh-huh

#s78
Yeah

#s80
Well well I do wo- uh research in computer science

#s81
and I 've just been doing that for a few years now

#s82
so uh I my job has most of the benefits I want

#s84
Uh what I really like is I like being

#s85
like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as I 'd like

#s86
but uh you know that 's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of

#s87
uh they also

#s88
a really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education

#s89
Like I I get night courses that they they 'll cover right now

#s90
and that 's really good

#s91
yeah

#s95
Right

#s99
Uh-huh

#s106
Right
