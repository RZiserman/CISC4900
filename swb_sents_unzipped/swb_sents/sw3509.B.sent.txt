#s2
Well I I 'm not really certain how I uh I 'm not certain that that it does a lot of good I mean that it ends up ends up effectively uh uh uh avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties

#s5
Yet on the other hand uh I do n't know

#s6
I mean there is things that

#s7
seems like it 's it 's it 's the right thing to do

#s8
Now you know I mean somebody a s- s- serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty fifty children in a school yard

#s9
you kind of

#s10
I do n't know

#s11
What about yourself

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
I mean people like

#s18
I

#s19
it 's been

#s20
I mean like the Arab societies and stuff end up uh having e- effective effective punishments

#s21
and and they 're extremely severe

#s22
Uh I you know I think to a certain degree the reason that it it does n't serve as a deterrent uh may be because y- you never know if it 's going to be a- applied

#s23
Right

#s24
un- unlike uh like in in Arab societies If you get get caught stealing they chop off your hand

#s25
and and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand

#s27
and everybody knows exactly what what for

#s29
Uh and you know and here with our court system and and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can you can kind of always count on the fact

#s30
or or there is a good chance you 're going to get off

#s36
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s39
some people

#s40
Yeah

#s41
Except that I mean the the average cost to si- to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is is extremely high I mean something I I was amazed at Uh uh per year

#s42
it 's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year To keep people in jail

#s44
Uh you know and it 's sort of a sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment

#s46
but on the other hand uh uh you know I do n't I do n't know if it 's that is that is that serious that they 're really never going to be out of jail

#s47
uh

#s51
Uh-huh

#s56
Oh I know

#s57
I mean you ca n't

#s58
it does n't

#s59
Taking taking one more life does n't does n't does n't re- get things back the way they were right

#s63
Yeah

#s64
I do n't know

#s65
I I do n't I really do n't know

#s66
uh

#s68
I 'm in Texas

#s70
W- w-

#s72
No

#s73
I 'm in Austin

#s75
Where where are you calling from

#s78
Oh I see

#s79
uh-huh

#s81
It 's Texas is has is one of the one of the s-

#s82
well

#s83
I guess there is more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment

#s84
Uh Texas has had it for a while

#s85
It 's one of the quickest

#s86
it it

#s87
once it was it was reallowed

#s88
I think it was outlawed for a while but uh by the supreme court I mean or the interpretation of the constitution

#s89
and it seems like everybody stopped

#s90
and then and then once they sort of reallowed it Texas was one of the first to uh to actually uh implement it again

#s92
They do it by uh by do it by lethal injection

#s94
Uh I 'm originally from Kansas

#s95
and in Kansas also uh they they almost immediately put back capital punishment

#s96
and uh there they do it by hanging

#s98
Still uh they have

#s99
I still remember the the the movie uh IN COLD BLOOD

#s100
I do n't know if you 've ever

#s101
I 'm sure you 're familiar with it

#s102
but have you seen the movie

#s105
Yeah

#s106
That way

#s108
Yeah

#s109
well they they show it

#s110
not not

#s111
I mean the the movie was made in like nineteen sixty-two or something like that

#s113
and so it 's uh it 's not particularly graphic

#s114
but on the other hand it 's it 's fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows

#s115
It 's kind of a barn like structure

#s120
Is that right

#s121
Are you there in school

#s124
Yeah

#s128
Uh-huh

#s129
has has a

#s130
yeah

#s132
Has a real bullets

#s133
and the rest of them have blanks

#s135
Yeah

#s136
I I certainly would n't want to be the executioner

#s137
I know that

#s140
I 've always said that if I if I had to kill and clean and my own my own meat I think I 'd become a vegetarian

#s142
As long as you 're sort of safely removed from it it seems seems not so so bad I guess
