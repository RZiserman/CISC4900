#s2
Yes

#s3
I have a Macintosh S E thirty

#s8
Uh-huh

#s12
What do you use yours for mostly

#s14
Uh-huh

#s17
Well I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base

#s18
and uh about the only thing

#s19
I am uh I 'm just starting to get into uh a little bit more communications now

#s20
I 've just today ordered a fax modem

#s21
so I 'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using you know

#s23
you do n't have to make a hard copy that way

#s25
Uh are you using windows

#s28
Uh-huh

#s29
Uh-huh

#s30
Well it 's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Well the one thing I used to use a uh

#s37
I 've never used an I B M actually

#s38
I used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now

#s42
But I do n't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now

#s44
I do n't have uh any compilers

#s46
so I 'm uh

#s48
I use it in my business

#s50
I uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs

#s57
That 's uh exactly what yeah that 's the kind of thing I 'm working with exactly

#s59
You seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that

#s63
Uh-huh

#s66
Right

#s67
Well now we uh

#s68
what I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though

#s70
Most of the stuff that I do is not uh interactive

#s72
and I use it for t- uh data analysis on testing

#s73
so

#s75
Well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests

#s76
uh

#s78
You know when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones are n't find out how reliable the test is

#s81
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort

#s82
So it 's involves a lot of spreadsheet use

#s86
Well I was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files

#s87
I ca n't believe you know I 've got uh five uh megabytes on this one now

#s90
and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K

#s94
Yeah

#s98
Oh the old the old Apple uh the the original Apple had what yeah forty-eight I guess did n't it

#s101
My goodness

#s104
Uh-huh

#s108
Uh-huh

#s111
Well the S P thirty goes up to eight

#s113
but I have n't upgraded it quite that far yet

#s114
I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk

#s115
I do n't know

#s116
They say that system seven uses a lot of memory
