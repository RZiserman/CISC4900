#s1
Before the one will take

#s2
uh okay

#s3
let 's see

#s4
I guess uh I can start

#s5
I 'm actually we 're actually trying to find one now because our family 's growing

#s7
Yeah

#s8
Uh so I 'm looking at uh something larger than what we have

#s9
We 've got like an eighty-four Charger that 's about gone and a uh an eighty-nine Horizon

#s10
So I 'm looking for something uh littler bigger

#s13
yeah

#s14
Uh so we were thinking mini van for a while

#s15
and uh we 're looking at uh some just four door five passenger sedans as well

#s19
Uh I do n't really have a preference either way I guess You know

#s21
it 's you know

#s22
I guess the American cars had a bad reputation

#s23
but I have n't had any real substantial problems with the ones I 've had

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Yeah

#s37
Yeah

#s38
I mean e- even if it 's just details it seems like uh they you know

#s41
I j-

#s42
there 's a door seal that does n't quite seal

#s43
and you have to take it back every once in a while

#s44
It 's clearly just a a design problem there

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
Oh like a Miata or something like that

#s60
Um

#s62
Interesting

#s65
Yeah

#s66
That 's interesting

#s67
Yeah

#s68
I guess probably the factors we 'd use to compare are a little different because I look for you know size and safety and then mileage

#s70
Probably

#s72
Uh

#s76
Yeah

#s78
Yeah

#s79
I c- I think in terms of computer terminology I look at you know price performance and things like that And then a little bit at life expectancy I guess

#s82
but it you know depends on what you what you pay initially

#s84
But you know I 've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger

#s86
Actually it was my wife 's car that she brought into the marriage

#s88
and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton

#s90
It 's you know

#s91
we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles

#s92
but uh the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it

#s94
so But uh

#s103
Um

#s105
Uh-huh

#s107
Yeah

#s109
That 's interesting

#s110
But

#s111
yeah

#s112
it it 's hard to beat some of the

#s113
uh like I guess in particular we 're looking at a like a ninety-one Corsica uh buy back at a they say G M sponsored auction

#s114
but I think they 're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after you know it 's after they 've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it

#s117
and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you

#s119
Yeah

#s120
because I guess uh

#s121
I mean well ninety-twos granted

#s122
but the new ones you know

#s124
fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot

#s126
so all the depreciation has been taken off

#s127
and s- the dealer comes out okay you know

#s130
I do n't know what kind of I do n't know what G M corporate kind of hit the I do n't know what kind of hit they take on it

#s131
but sounds like everybody 's had their chance to make their money off it

#s132
and So but uh I do n't know

#s135
we keep looking at that mini van

#s136
It 's just you know

#s137
we can get a like a Caravan for at twelve five

#s140
but that 's a little bit more than we want to spend right now

#s141
But uh uh it 's interesting

#s142
but uh I do n't know

#s143
if if uh it seems to be
