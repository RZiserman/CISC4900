Okay

#s6
Right

#s8
Right

#s9
I agree too

#s10
I do n't think the jury should be the ones that that put the sense- sentencings down

#s11
I think the judges should

#s12
or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point Might be better at than just regular civil people Not knowing you know exactly what things are from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know

#s20
Right

#s24
Yeah

#s25
and

#s27
Right

#s28
that 's

#s29
yeah

#s30
And and most people that do sit on juries

#s31
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they 're that lucky sometimes Or you know what whatever the case may be And and may not have any idea of what what the standard punishment would be for it

#s34
And it they may have some different idea

#s35
I mean it might be more important for them to put a sen- sen- sentencing down that was uh longer you know that did n't fit the punishment did n't fit the crime

#s36
Or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be

#s39
I I think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it

#s40
The only thing I worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and you know sometimes might have more pull which that does happen

#s42
I mean we ca n't say it does n't because it does happen

#s43
I mean not everybody is you know has has the right morals sometimes

#s44
People can be paid off or politically or whatever the case may be

#s46
and sometimes that 's not real fair either though

#s47
so

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Right

#s57
Right

#s58
Right

#s59
Well well also what I do n't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in

#s60
and and his attorney gets his sentences sentencing reduced because he 's gone to a lesser charge like I do n't know what assault or something or

#s62
But which that does n't make any sense to me either

#s63
I know it 's hard to prove rape and whatnot

#s64
and and and the person that was raped or whatever does n't

#s65
I mean it 's embarrassing and all this other stuff

#s67
and they they 're put on like they were the ones that caused it or whatever

#s68
but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did

#s69
and and you should n't be able to go on the lesser charge

#s70
I do n't I do n't think that 's right because all 's that 's going to do is say Oh well you know that was a breeze

#s71
I can go out and do it again and you know have the same thing happen

#s73
That 's that 's not right

#s77
Right

#s81
Uh-huh

#s84
Yeah

#s88
And to me how can you how can you make a decision if you do n't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not

#s89
somebody thinks it it had because they 've got it there

#s91
So the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information

#s94
Do n't they

#s99
They only put part of it

#s101
Yeah

#s104
Right

#s105
Well that 's just like that old witness game

#s106
well it 's a game kids play too

#s107
but uh somebody did it just for your train of thought where they they showed something

#s108
and they asked

#s109
they there were uh like four people
