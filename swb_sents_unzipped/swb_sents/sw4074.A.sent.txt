What kind of pets do you have

#s4
One rotten cat

#s7
I heard a laugh in the background

#s11
Do n't you like cats

#s14
Oh yeah

#s19
That 's odd

#s20
How does he treat the other people

#s22
Wow

#s27
Did he raise him or something

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
Huh that 's interesting

#s36
Huh We have a a mutt

#s38
Well we we named it Hooper because that 's where we got it from

#s40
Uh some lady she uh

#s41
a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house

#s43
and she use to work for a veter- veterinarian

#s44
so she would spay- uh neuter them give them all their shots

#s46
and we saw an ad saying it was free

#s47
so we went down there and picked it up

#s48
and it 's been an excellent dog

#s49
but it 's my first dog I 've had

#s50
and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work

#s52
so that 's mostly why we got it To keep her company while I am away at work

#s54
Uh yeah

#s55
Right now it it is

#s57
It 's kind of good training

#s58
I mean we have been trying for kids

#s59
but right now we have n't had any

#s61
but it 's pretty good training I think really keeps her on her toes

#s63
Uh my brother has

#s64
Uh we did n't do a lot with them

#s65
Uh I never felt like it was mine or anything

#s66
you could n't do anything

#s68
But I mean that did did more responsibility When it 's yours and not your brother 's

#s70
But

#s75
Uh-huh

#s77
That 's what we found

#s78
Ours is uh like a cockapoo

#s80
I think it 's half cocker spaniel and half poodle

#s82
But it 's a really good dog

#s84
I do n't know

#s85

#s87
Is your cat a purebred

#s93
