#s2
Well it depends where in Dallas you are

#s4
There are certainly parts of town I would not want to live in

#s6
Because it 's the situation

#s7
it is very location dependent

#s9
and there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire

#s17
Uh-huh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s26
That uh the what they call the latchkey children

#s33
Yeah

#s34
The sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class

#s35
so I think our uh

#s37
not that we do n't have a certain amount of local problems

#s39
but on the other hand uh we get the uh affect of the uh the city

#s40
and uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes A small number of assaults

#s42
uh well if we have one murder a year that 's probably as many

#s44
but then you know you go into Dallas

#s45
and they are unfortunately uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day

#s52
Uh-huh

#s55
Well the thing is I do n't

#s56
it 's one of those things where if you 're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on

#s58
Unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like uh wherever there are more uh criminals there are more policemen

#s60
but that 's which came first

#s62
But on the other side of it is

#s63
it 's it 's basically the the problem is within the in the society and the society 's views

#s65
and well uh since now I 'm in my mid-forties when I was in grad school or when I was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area I thought you know crime was was reasonably unknown and just the situation that 's developed with the the drug aspect of uh uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts uh

#s72
Because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that uh I even had to worry about

#s74
But I think you know that there is a lot in the society where things have changed

#s75
uh so it 's effected all of us

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s91
You know in a sense I do n't I 'm n- I have real mixed feelings on that

#s93
because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh uh

#s94
it would certainly be an interesting test

#s96
but the other side of it to me

#s98
Uh y-

#s99
well the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side

#s100
and I think if I look back fifty or a hundred years I 'd say you know back then there were the opium dens

#s102
but the thing is if somebody ruined their life uh society did n't try to then save themselves from it

#s103
they let this person who had ruined it uh become well die or whatever

#s105
I mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short

#s108
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have you know physically ruined themselves

#s111
Yeah

#s114
and so to me that 's

#s115
I uh I would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then do n't use them

#s119
Uh Uh-huh

#s123
Uh-huh

#s131
Yeah

#s132
well th- some of that

#s133
and of course I 'm a baby of the old school

#s135
but it it bothers me from the fifties on

#s136
not that I 'd remember that much from the fifties

#s138
but but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality

#s144
And so they

#s146
in the

#s147
there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties

#s148
but nowadays there 's so much on TV where where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing

#s149
Of course uh I work for lawyers a lot

#s151
and I see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and you know there 's a million dollars you can have uh for mental duress or whatever

#s154
But you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh

#s155
in Europe they seem to have mentality

#s156
and drunk driving is a good one

#s157
is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable

#s159
And yeah

#s160
if you 're going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver

#s162
In this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is we do n't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds the punishment is extreme

#s163
And we mean it

#s168
Uh-huh

#s170
Uh-huh

#s172
Uh-huh

#s174
Uh-huh

#s177
Uh-huh

#s180
Yeah

#s185
Uh-huh

#s187
Yeah

#s189
But that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was uh misplaced for years

#s193
that you know it was an acceptable social behavior

#s201
What are what does your city have for gun control if anything
