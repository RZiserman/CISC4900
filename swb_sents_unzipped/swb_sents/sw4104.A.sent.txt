#s1
Anyway uh

#s4
What do I do

#s5
uh at the moment it 's under chaos

#s6
Uh right now I 'm just uh

#s7
I I do n't really have a budget per se

#s8
I 'm I uh it 's called living within your means You know which means at the moment paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car does n't collapse

#s12
Uh but uh no

#s13
I do n't really have a budget at the moment

#s14
Uh but I have uh I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month

#s15
and then I do n't usually do n't exceed that unless I unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if I have car expenses

#s16
and then that then it goes through the moon

#s17
so

#s20
Yeah

#s21
so uh what do yo-

#s28
So you can afford to get a house

#s32
Yeah

#s37
Yeah

#s38
So what do you and your husband do

#s40
Are you really

#s44
Um

#s46
No kidding

#s48

#s50
Overseas where would you be going

#s53

#s56
How long would you be there

#s63
With with what Church

#s65
Oh yes

Yes

#s68

#s69

#s73
There there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was that belongs to them

#s74
So uh are you uh are you uh active in translation

#s78
Uh-huh

#s86
True

#s87
true enough

#s88
So uh what what uh what languages do you speak besides English of course

#s111
In MUMBLEx

#s115
Must have been terrible

#s116
The uh

#s117
was it Henry Macon said that the the uh language was like a man slowly bleeding to death

#s118
So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die

#s119
and I it just amazes me that the French do n't recognize that

#s120
Free style English is just

#s121
takes on
