Actually I 've been involved in electronics a long time Uh in computers

#s2
and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home Uh up until I guess maybe about a year and a half ago

#s4
I got one for my son A a Macintosh uh L C

#s6
It 's a real easy to use color uh computer

#s7
and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it

#s8
and he uses it for his school work

#s16
Huh

#s21
Where you going to school

#s23
I see

#s26
In engineering

#s28
So that explains wha- all the uh computer assignments

#s31
Well do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work

#s38
No

#s39
No

#s40
I just have one for my son

#s41
and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing

#s45
At wo- at work uh I 'm a technologist uh

#s46
and I in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming

#s47
Uh but now I find myself using the computer

#s48
even the computer at work is primarily a uh word processing system and a communication system

#s53
Yes

#s54
Emil is probably pulls down a third a- of all my time

#s63
Uh-huh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s70
Huh

#s71
Well I 'm a old-timer

#s72
I did my Master 's thesis on uh a typewriter

#s74
Uh I rented an I B M Selectric

#s76
And it was a pretty big deal

#s85
Yeah

#s86
It uh well you know it 's just it was just a completely different world then

#s90
I like it

#s91
yeah

#s92
I like it from a distance really

#s93
I I see the packages on it uh that are available

#s94
and it 's nice

#s95
I really do n't use it myself

#s97
Uh I when I come home from work I I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things

#s100
Uh so I let my son do it

#s101
and Uh of course you know there 's uh there 's an intellectual evolution taking place where

#s103
it 's sort of a joke

#s104
but it 's really true

#s105
the old-timers even the people who are technologists do n't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot

#s106
and the kids they just take to it like candy
