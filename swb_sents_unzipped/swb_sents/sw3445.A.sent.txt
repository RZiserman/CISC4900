All right

I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight

#s5
That is correct

#s7
Are you a movie buff

#s11
Well I have a V C R

#s12
and I see most all of mine there

#s13
What have you seen recently that you enjoyed

#s17
No

#s18
I have n't

#s20
Now I I live alone

#s21
Consequently I do n't like these sa- psycho things

#s25
Oh okay

#s26
Have you seen the mov-

#s27
if

#s28
do you have a V C R

#s31
Have you seen the movie CLASS ACTION with Gene Hackman

#s34
I saw it this weekend

#s35
and it is uh to me an outstanding movie

#s36
I thoroughly enjoyed it

#s37
He is uh an attorney

#s38
and his daughter is an attorney

#s39
and she has a suit against his company

#s40
You know it 's one of those things

#s43
But there 's a lot of l-

#s44
well it 's just it 's something that anyone can watch and enjoy

#s46
Beg your pardon

#s48
Yes

#s49
he is

#s51
Yes

#s52
I 've seen HOOSIERS

#s53
Saw it just again the other night for

#s56
Oh did you

#s61
Have you seen the movie um CROSSING DELANCY

#s63
Now that 's one I have watched oh six or eight times

#s64
I always feel so good when I get through with that movie

#s67
I do too

#s68
DIRTY DANCING and CROSSING DELANCY are two of my favorite

#s69
So well what business are you in

#s71
Oh

#s72
In New Hampshire

#s73
All right

#s75
Oh all right

#s76
Okay

#s77
So is everything going all right up there

#s80
Oh well that 's that bad then

#s81
Half an hour we do that just going to downtown Dallas

#s83
So

#s85
That makes a lot of sense

#s86
But um we

#s87
are you a native of that part of the country

#s94
Oh

#s97
Uh sounds wonderful

#s98
Did you have damage this year with hurricanes

#s101
I happened to be in Nassau

#s102
and we got the backlash of that thing

#s103
And they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there

#s104
and it was quite an experience

#s105
so

#s106
Well what movies are you looking forward to seeing now

#s109
Okay

#s110
Have you seen GREEN CARD

#s114
That 's a real warm movie

#s115
It it really just turned out nicely

#s116
So I would recommend that if you have a chance

#s121
Well if you if you can get GREEN CARD go for it

#s124
I have been working at uh as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas

#s125
and I have watched uh GROSS ANATOMY

#s126
Have you seen that one

#s129
Okay

#s130
And I do n't know

#s131
I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical school

#s132
But I hope you have a very Merry Christmas

#s134
I 'm looking forward to it

#s136
Well
