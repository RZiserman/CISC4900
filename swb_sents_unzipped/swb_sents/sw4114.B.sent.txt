#s2
Uh it 's pretty good you know

#s3
You get uh closer to the uh coast here

#s4
and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants

#s7
Yeah

#s8
it 's

#s9
when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial

#s11
but I 'm I 'm about uh thirty miles west of there

#s12
so you have uh actually green trees and such that you do n't notice that that other part of New Jersey exists

#s16
Actually very

#s17
Y- you know you go even a few wi- miles out

#s18
and you got uh farms and everything

#s19
so you relatively clear air

#s21
But uh

#s26
Oh d- definitely

#s27
It 's

#s29
uh you know there are a large number of them on the road

#s30
They 're all you know going

#s31
and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair

#s35
Oh e- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year

#s37
and it 's like

#s38
You get the car that 's in the accident

#s39
and muffler falls off or something

#s41
and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that

#s45
Yeah

#s46
that

#s47
and I think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets so you

#s49
natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline

#s56
It it is coming from cars though

#s59
I mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon Which is one of the major flor- chlorofar- fluorocarbons

#s65
Well it it

#s67
No

#s68
it 's it 's the type of thing there that uh you know

#s69
the Third World countries are less industrial

#s70
and they want to become industrial

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
so they 're on the different part of the cycle of the U S

#s73
The U S used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today

#s77
Or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to

#s86
Yeah

#s89
No

#s91
Well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction which is the main source of what 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants

#s98
Mostly I 've mostly been in the east coast

#s99
so that 's going between Atlanta Washing- D C area

#s102


#
Well not not as hard as some places out west because you do n't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the inversion and Los Angeles and a- rest of California which is just terrible it sounds

#s113
Uh-huh

#s115
Yeah

#s121
Yeah

#s122
there it 's almost all automobiles because there 's not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it

#s123
Exactly

#s126
Uh-huh
