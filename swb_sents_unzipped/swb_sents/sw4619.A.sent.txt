#s3
That 's right

#s4
that 's right

#s5
You know what what uh what do you think is important

#s6
If you were

#s7
uh I do n't know how how old you are

#s8
but if you had if you had uh parents say or or or th- grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for

#s11
Huh

#s13
Yeah

#s16
Yeah

#s18
Huh

#s19
Well my uh uh my wife 's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh Minnesota

#s21
and we go there uh once a year

#s22
We see we tend to see her there cause we 're in Boston

#s23
so we 're pretty far away

#s24
When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her

#s26
And it seems uh

#s27
I mean the the environment there I do n't know too much about it

#s28
but it it seems nice enough

#s29
Uh it it 's hard

#s30
at least half of the residents I would say are not not mentally sound

#s31
So it 's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r- to retain uh clarity say uh you know

#s33
Yeah

#s34
Well I I don- I do n't know

#s35
We we also my wife and I uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that 's just a mile from our house

#s36
We uh she goes more often than I

#s37
We used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there

#s38
And we 'd take we have a two year old son

#s39
and so we sometimes we 'd take him with us

#s40
And uh there I would say it 's the same thing

#s41
It 's it 's a nice uh relatively nice environment

#s42
but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just e- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly uh certainly have ar- ar- are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on

#s43
It 's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see an- and see all these other people who really do n't know where they are

#s45
I think yeah

#s46
I think they 're relatively re- respectful Yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be

#s47
I I think sometimes you know I 've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and but things that are not reasonable

#s49
and so at some level the the the uh

#s51
I 'm sure that the that the uh the staff l- learn what 's normal for this person

#s52
and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person 's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they do n't really need what they think they need you know

#s56
Oh yeah

#s57
Yeah

#s58
I 'll tell you one thing though that 'll that that I I saw that was really nice

#s59
We saw a husband and wife

#s60
we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together

#s61
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were

#s62
but these two were

#s64
And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house

#s67
And so

#s68
Yeah

#s69
you walked in there

#s70
and it did n't look like uh you know how yo- you you walk into some rooms and there 's it 's completely generic

#s71
There 's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person

#s72
and that 's it

#s73
But this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that

#s74
and they had all their stuff from their house

#s75
and it looked like uh i- i- it must have been

#s76
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them

#s77
and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know s- s- uh

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Huh

#s84
Yeah

#s88
Huh

#s89
MUMBLEx temporary

#s90

#s91

#s92
