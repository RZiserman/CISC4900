#s2
Uh yes

#s3
I do as far as uh as far as uh as far as immigration as a whole goes

#s5
I think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world

#s7
Uh I

#s8
there just is not going to be room for all of us

#s9
We do n't have jobs now

#s10
I I think uh I think when we come to a time of recession that it 's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time

#s11
Uh I hope you 're one of the employed right now

#s13
I am one of the unemployed right now

#s14
I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company

#s15
and uh I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings

#s16
but they had two thousand applications

#s18
And I know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you know doing my line of work

#s20
And of course I 'm not perfectly happy about not having a job

#s22
So how do you feel

#s32
Right

#s37
Okay

#s38
and I think you 're right in both cases

#s42
And I think probably it 's pretty important right there

#s43
How do you feel about Haitian immigration

#s49
Actually actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here

#s51
And it would have nothing to do with political situations

#s52
It would have to do with poverty

#s56
Oh my gosh

#s57
Have you been have you been to southern Florida

#s61
Well I mean and the two of them together

#s62
I mean we can

#s63
it 's just as well you know

#s64
it 's hardly America anymore

#s67
But there 's some differences in the immigrants that that we 're getting now

#s68
Well I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration

#s71
I think probably your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals

#s73
But uh the majority of the illegal immigration we 're getting now they do not come here to blend into America

#s74
Uh they they do n't bother to learn our language

#s75
and uh first of all th- they

#s76
I 'm sorry this I really feel strongly about this

#s78
We send a lot of money to Mexico
