#s4
Well our public schools are are really poor I feel

#s6
Uh I 'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation

#s7
but uh we 're toward the bottom

#s9
And uh there 's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong That you would think it would be easy to correct

#s12
But the system does n't allow for the corrections

#s14
How about you

#s17
Oh yes

#s20
Yes

#s22
And Cobb County is better than the county I 'm in

#s24
She was in Cobb County

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Okay

#s35
Well that 's great

#s37
Uh-huh

#s40
Well I feel that we 're way behind

#s41
Uh I have a son that is in the fourth grade

#s43
and uh they have just now taken up division

#s45
Yeah

#s46
And MUMBLEx

#s48
uh i-

#s49
e-

#s50
my husband and I go to the store

#s51
and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things

#s52
and I feel like uh there are several areas that we 're just really really slow in

#s54
And uh I do n't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system

#s55
It is

#s57
Well well for one thing there 's not enough money in the school system

#s58
And the money they do have they 're not they do not use it wisely

#s60
Uh she my son 's teacher has twenty-seven students

#s62
And that 's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis

#s63
Uh

#s66
but more than that I do n't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children

#s68
And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps ca- the class in an uproar and you 're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal 's office It it you know it can it can really be bad

#s72
Uh also I think we have a lot of uh Hispanics

#s75
and we have a lot of uh

#s76
the county I am I 'm in the minorities are mostly Hispanic

#s80
No

#s81
We 're from a county we 're from the county they marched in

#s82
We 're in Forsyth county

#s84
yes

#s85
and we

#s86
and there 's very very few blacks

#s88
Uh so so that 's uh

#s89
I I hate to say

#s90
it 's not a problem uh because I hate to feel like they are a problem although they are

#s95
But it is a problem Uh especially in the inner schools inner city

#s100
Well

#s101
and you ca n't put all the children in special education

#s104
Uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know

#s107
Uh-huh

#s112
Yeah

#s114
But your teacher had control

#s118
Uh-huh

#s119
Yeah

#s120
I I believe I was too

#s125
Uh-huh

#s126
Uh well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school

#s128
We just can not afford it

#s131
Uh if
