Okay

#s2
um I guess we 're going to talk describe uh job benefits

#s3
and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits

#s5
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Oh yeah

#s16
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s20
I see

#s22
Uh well I 'm

#s23
my medical coverage is with an H M O

#s25
um so that 's in my opinion that 's get- that 's bordering on a health clinic

#s26
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage

#s29
Um

#s34
Uh-huh

#s39
Right

#s42
Yes

#s43
That 's right

#s44
yeah

#s45
I 'm I 'm fairly young myself

#s46
I 've only been

#s47
when I first started working which

#s48
three years ago is when I first got into full time employment

#s50
and uh at that time I immediately joined the H M O

#s51
and I never really

#s52
so the only doctor I I 've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O

#s53
and uh you know for me it 's worked out real good

#s58
Uh-huh

#s62
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
Yeah

#s67
um like you you mentioned you work for a school system

#s68
I work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch

#s70
and I guess another one that that I rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um I enjoy as a benefit

#s74
Right

#s76
yeah

#s77
getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation

#s84
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s92
Right

#s94
Well um I 'm not actually on the teaching faculty

#s95
but we have a large research organization associated with the university

#s96
and that 's who I work with

#s98
Um and we 're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do

#s99
We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study

#s103
Right

#s105
Right

#s111
Uh-huh

#s114
Oh yeah

#s115
Uh-huh

#s117
Are there are there any things that that you 'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits
