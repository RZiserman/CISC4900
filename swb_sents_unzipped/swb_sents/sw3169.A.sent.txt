#s1
Is uh kind of fun

#s2
It 's best done when you have leisure time

#s3
and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now

#s4
And I grew up in an area that uh was just a few feet from a rather large lake

#s5
and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake

#s6
and we had a variety of boats at our disposal

#s7
Uh

#s8
I worked for a camp for a number of years

#s9
My father was on staff there

#s10
and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats speedboats

#s11
you name it they had it

#s12
and we did a lot of watering water sports

#s13
But I think uh the thing I liked the best was uh

#s14
we spent about a summer

#s15
couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h- big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side

#s16
and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it

#s17
If you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up

#s18
It was n't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it uh upright again

#s19
This one you had to work with

#s20
You get out of the water again and get it upright

#s21
And uh sailing was was kind of nice

#s22
to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were tacking back and forth

#s23
and uh more than once we 'd get out there on a really stormy day

#s24
and uh the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing

#s25
and as soon as the front came over it was calm

#s26
So you 're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle

#s27
and you paddle your way back in and hope it does n't start raining on you right away

#s28
And that did n't always work

#s29
We oftentimes got wet

#s30
But uh it 's it 's a nice nice hobby to have

#s31
Nowadays I do n't think I could afford the boat or the time

#s32
nor do we live that close to a lake anymore

#s33
so things change I guess

#s34
What are your memories of boating

#s35
or current

#s46
Right

#s47
That 's true

#s49
Yeah

#s50
I remember learning how to ski oh

#s51
I guess I was seven or eight years old

#s52
and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to

#s53
and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres

#s54
and it was uh it had a lot of uh turtles in it

#s55
And I got all ready to go

#s56
and I was down in the water and and set to go

#s57
and uh and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back

#s59
It did n't hurt too much

#s60
but it bit enough to where I let go

#s61
And the boat went off without me

#s62
and I reached back there and s- pushed him away and got out of the water a a while

#s63
and and uh it did n't even leave a mark

#s64
It was just a little nibble

#s65
and so I told everybody what happened

#s66
and they go oh yeah sure you know

#s67
And so I get back down in there

#s68
and and I 'll be if he did n't do it again

#s69
This time a little earlier

#s70
and and I had let go before then and before they took off this time and and swatted him away

#s71
So I moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up

#s72
Did n't go very far

#s73
but I got up

#s74
And it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career

#s75
but now I 've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me

#s76
I 've I 've uh done about all I dare do on skis

#s77
You know skiing on one and jumping around here and there

#s78
and I I I know how you can get injured doing much more than that

#s79
and I just ca n't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that

#s80
Just uh ca n't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager I guess

#s81
So life just changes a little bit in that respect

#s82
I 'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that does n't have a uh well what they call trick skis

#s83
They 'll allow you to ski backwards

#s84
I have n't cr- managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet

#s85
but uh

#s87
Yeah

#s88
it it would be kind of nice

#s89
I had n't quite figured out

#s90
I do n't have anybody to teach me either

#s91
That 's another little thing

#s92
You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do

#s93
but just from what I 've seen you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around

#s95
But uh I do n't know

#s96
maybe someday I 'll I 'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end weekend or something
