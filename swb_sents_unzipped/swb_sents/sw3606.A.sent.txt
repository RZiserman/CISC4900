Uh-huh

#s7

#s9
Huh-uh

#s14
Um I like L A LAW not because it 's realistic but it 's entertaining

#s18
Um

#s21
Let 's see

#s22
I watch CHEERS sometimes And mostly just movies when there 's a good movie on

#s25
Actually when there is n't a good movie on too

#s27
I just like to have the T V on if you know if I 'm home alone or something

#s29
have

#s30
either the radio or the T V -s got to be on the whole time

#s34
Oh really

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
I well I do n't because I work all day

#s45
But um I pro-

#s46
I usually do if I 'm home for a couple of days like you know around Christmas or whatever

#s47
after a while I 'll start watching it

#s49
and then on

#s50
for a while I 'll ask people if they know what happened

#s52
and then I 'll just forget it

#s54
Uh I do n't even remember

#s55
the last time I watched was back in college

#s56
It was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something

#s58
and I maybe watched it for a week

#s60
but um I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the you know

#s61
they would n't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera

#s64
It was a

#s67
Uh-huh

#s68
Uh-huh

#s71
Well you said you have kids

#s72
How old

#s76
So you 're you are n't a SESAME STREET fan

#s81
Uh-huh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s86
Supposed to be a great babysitter

#s91
Yeah

#s93
Um

#s95
Uh-huh

#s98
I know

#s99
what time is that on

#s100
I never see it

#s102
Oh okay

#s103
I 'm not home then

#s104
that 's why I do n't see it

#s110
Is n't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange

#s116
Uh-huh

#s117
uh-huh

#s119
What 's that

#s121
Yeah

#s122
well I guess it was n't a real good topic for us

#s123
but Well tell me

#s124
is it snowing up there

#s126
No

#s128
Uh-huh

#s130
Wow But do you have snow on the ground now

#s132
Oh

#s134
Well that 's nice

#s137
Oh gosh

#s138
we 've broken all sorts of records

#s140
They 've got

#s141
I mean we still have some highways closed

#s142
and it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago

#s144
But um oh just phenomenal

#s145
I mean I you know

#s146
you see it on the news all the time

#s147
but until you 've really seen it it does- it does n't really hit you

#s149
But I was driving home from work Friday

#s150
and I saw there were some stop signs I mean submerged up to the writing on the stop sign

#s151
and that was just

#s153
it was amazing to me

#s156
So

#s159
Oh there 's been a lot

#s160
yeah

#s162
It 's it 's too bad

#s163
but you know the thing is that this happens

#s164
in the last three years it 's happened at least once a year if not twice

#s165
But the people continue to move back in the flood zones

#s168
So I do n't know

#s169
I mean you got to wonder how long they 're going to keep doing that for

#s171
I do n't think I would

#s173
Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood

#s176
Yeah

#s178
Yeah

#s179
I do

#s180
yeah

#s183
Have you made a lot of calls

#s184
or

#s186
Uh-huh

#s189
Oh

#s191
Do you get paid for these

#s193
Five dollars a call

#s195
Gosh

#s196
I wish I could do that

#s198
We ca n't get paid for it
