#s1
Wh- what 's your uh

#s3
are you into the Cowboys

#s11
Oh yeah

#s13
that that 's all right

#s18
Yeah

#s21
Well I do n't know

#s22
I kind of go back and forth uh depending on who 's really hot and who 's not

#s23
I guess I 'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects

#s25
But uh I guess if I have uh my druthers I 'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks

#s27
I kind of like them

#s30
Yeah

#s31
They 're kind of

#s36
Yo-

#s41
Yeah

#s42
To be honest with you I I probably watch uh college a little bit more than I do pro

#s44
Yeah

#s46
I kind of like college actually

#s47
Quite a bit

#s52
Is it

#s56
Yeah

#s57
yeah

#s58
That could be

#s60
Yeah

#s64
Yeah

#s65
You probably would n't like my favorite team in college then

#s68
No

#s69
I root for Nebraska quite a bit

#s73
Ye-

#s77
Yeah

#s79
Well I can see I can see definitely how you get into that

#s80
I to be honest with you I find th- that too much running gets pretty boring as well

#s81
and

#s84
Right

#s87
Sure

#s89
Well I think they 're starting to realize that

#s90
A lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much I think they 're starting to realize that they just ca n't compete anymore

#s95
Right

#s97
Yeah

#s99
So uh what 's d-

#s100
this World League is coming in

#s101
Uh that 's getting ready to start up right

#s104
Have you followed that very much

#s105
or

#s109
Yeah

#s112
Yeah

#s115
Right

#s116
It can take over a small market share

#s117
but nothing really

#s122
Right

#s125
Yeah

#s126
I think I agree with you

#s127
It 's it 's kind of interesting to see uh to see their claim of you know like world football

#s128
But when in reality it 's really Americans playing somewhere else you know

#s135
Yeah

#s136
Actually uh I kind of like soccer

#s137
I 've never really played it

#s139
but uh I like the idea

#s140
It 's it 's an interesting game to watch

#s141
That and rugby

#s142
I 've like to watch rugby every now and then

#s146
Yeah

#s147
whatever you want to call it there

#s154
Yeah MUMBLEx

#s155
Yeah

#s156
there 's an element there 's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere

#s160
Yeah

#s162
Right

#s163
exactly

#s164
Yeah

#s165
Tha-

#s169
Yeah

#s172
You 've played it then

#s175
No I doubt it you know

#s176
Not at least not in this country anyway

#s180
Yeah

#s181
It is

#s186
They really are

#s187
Yeah

#s192
Uh no

#s193
I do n't

#s194
To tell you the truth I 'm

#s199
Okay

#s201
To tell you the truth I 'm not even really from here

#s203
Yeah

#s204
I 'm I 'm up here for a year on an internship

#s207
But I I actually live in Florida

#s209
Yeah

#s211
Well you know I I mean who who who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay right

#s216
I mean I guess I could go for Miami

#s217
but I do n't know

#s220
I 'm from

#s221
I root for Nebraska

#s222
so I 'm I do n't have a real love for Miami anyway

#s223
But I do n't know

#s224
I I guess I get into pretty much
