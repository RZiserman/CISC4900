#s7
Yeah

#s8
because

#s10
I 've only made

#s11
this is only my third call

#s13
I I tried to make calls two different days

#s14
and I could n't get through

#s20
Does it

#s21
Yeah

#s22
I 've been trying to you know do that

#s23
and and sometimes I just ca n't wait that long

#s26
so I just hang up Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again

#s29
But I knew as soon as I heard your voice

#s30
I thought Kathy 's it 's Kathy Kester

#s33
Well let 's see

#s34
I um gosh I ca n't even think

#s35
I have n't read any

#s36
and you 're such a reader

#s37
I know that

#s38
and I

#s42
Yeah

#s43
The the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom

#s45
and it was um it was called um SMART WOMEN I think Um or something like that

#s48
And it was it was kind of

#s49
I really did n't like it at all

#s51
It was it was written back in the early eighties

#s53
And it was all this this um divorced woman syndrome of the um

#s55
it was almost like a a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing

#s57
It was really an interesting

#s58
because I I right away looked at when it was copyrighted Because I could tell by the theme of almost when it was written

#s63
And it was all about women searching for themselves And um you know a lot of hanky-panky going on

#s68
That 's right

#s70
Yeah

#s71
yeah

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Yeah

#s77
and she 's more famous for that

#s79
but she has been writing for adults also

#s81
and so I thought hey I 'll just try this you know and see what it was like

#s83
It was very um

#s84
the style was very conversational

#s86
You would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description

#s91
You know how that is

#s92
and um

#s95
Yeah

#s96
she has

#s97
because I I remember seeing a new book by her that was out

#s99
and I think it was a it was an adult book

#s101
So anyway

#s103
but that 's the last thing I I 've read

#s105
and um

#s111
Yeah

#s115
I

#s126
WUTHERING HEIGHTS

#s129
Oh yeah

#s130
by Jane Austen

#s131
yes

#s134
Yes

#s138
Uh-huh

#s141
Yeah

#s142
Because I I think I was I think I read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college

#s144
but I do n't remember it

#s147
And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and I got her the I got her someone

#s149
I think it was um oh some actress reading it

#s151
You know they had an abridged version of it on tape

#s153
And so I got that for her

#s154
and she loved doing that

#s157
But I remember that was the book

#s159
And now I I mean I think it 's around here somewhere

#s162
I 'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it

#s166
But um

#s170
Uh-huh

#s172
Yeah

#s173
Oh that 's what I do too

#s184
Oh yeah

#s186
Oh how neat

#s191
Oh great

#s193
Uh-huh

#s194
Uh-huh

#s197
Oh great

#s198
Oh that 's fascinating

#s201
Oh

#s205
Yeah

#s207
Yeah

#s210
Oh it 's a brand new book

#s213
Oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that

#s216
Yeah

#s218
Yes

#s219
Yeah

#s220
and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these with these all passing it from one to the other

#s226
Yeah

#s227
that 's the way it was I 'm sure back then

#s230
Yeah

#s231
Oh that 's interesting

#s236
Uh-huh

#s239
Oh yeah

#s242
Wow that 's rough

#s243
That 's real rough

#s245
Yeah

#s246
Well that 's a neat thing to be involved in

#s247
Because I think our I think my alma mater um Gettysburg I think they were just starting a magazine that was similar to that

#s253
I think that 's probably a sort of a thing to do in small colleges

#s256
but um

#s259
Uh-huh

#s262
Yeah

#s266
Oh yeah

#s268
Yeah

#s271
Oh

#s272

#s273

#s281
Oh that 's interesting

#s285
Gosh

#s287
That 's great

#s289
Boy you really lift me up to a different

#s290
I mean here I I 'm dealing with uh cleaning the stove

#s291
and

#s294
You know I 'm I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire

#s295
That would be nice
