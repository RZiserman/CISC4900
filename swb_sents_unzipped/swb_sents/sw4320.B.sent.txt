So how serious is the subject of crime in your area

#s7
Jeez

#s10
Well luckily it has n't gotten that bad here

#s12
Uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime

#s14
Uh but it 's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns Uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the Hispanic core

#s17
Uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions

#s22
Yeah

#s25
Uh-huh

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Yeah

#s30
Well that 's efficient

#s35
They 're decided they 're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort

#s42
Wow

#s45
Yeah

#s46
yeah

#s47
I 'd heard that phrase

#s56
Uh-huh

#s60
Yeah

#s61
there are n't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays

#s64
Uh-huh

#s71
Well uh there 's a couple of things that I 've heard

#s72
uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you 'd have to do

#s75
Uh course the the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else s- seems to be just you know the the the end results of of poverty and and parents that are n't doing any parenting and everything else

#s77
because I mean you know the parents are n't making a living at anything

#s79
Uh

#s81
And they 're accidental parents half the time anyway

#s87
It 's illegal

#s88
but it 's not wrong because all their friends do it

#s93
Yeah

#s97
Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem

#s98
Uh

#s100
the the social the other social problems would n't would n't go away

#s102
Uh

#s104
I mean there 's there 's been a lot of uh

#s105
and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus

#s106
but then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else

#s109
Uh and prohibition did n't stop it and did n't do anything really to slow
