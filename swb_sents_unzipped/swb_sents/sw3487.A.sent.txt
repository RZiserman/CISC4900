Uh advice on son or daughter going to college

#s3
Uh that 's advice that I will need in time future for my children rather than one that I have uh personal experience with

#s5
Uh I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet meet those needs

#s17
What advice would you give

#s20
I guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus

#s22
Uh stay in a dormitory if you can

#s23
Go to classes

#s24
talk to faculty members and students

#s33
Yes

#s34
I 'm thinking what what problems my children might have in that uh

#s36
but I agree with you

#s41
Uh-huh

#s47
Yeah

#s48
Well course MUMBLEx it it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness one to to work during the summer or or part time And two uh to to take out loans to assume uh debt after college

#s55
Yes

#s63
Mine is twelve

#s69
That 's my gut feeling too

#s70
I

#s71
my son is certainly not persuaded of that

#s72
Hello

#s75
Oh yeah uh

#s76
yes

#s77
I did n't have a car in college

#s78
I think it 's more an in- a burden to to provide for

#s84
Is it

#s87
Uh I did n't do any of those though I feel less strongly about the T V -s and refrigerators
