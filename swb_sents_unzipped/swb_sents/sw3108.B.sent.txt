#s2
Let 's see

#s3
the last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE

#s5
Well do n't bother

#s7
Well oh from a woman 's point of view and it was very uh chauvinistic as far as women go

#s8
Uh it was it was entertaining

#s9
but yeah

#s10
I do n't think the general audience would would go for it

#s12
How was that

#s15
That is one I 've been dying to see

#s19
Uh-huh

#s20
uh-huh

#s21
and

#s23
How long did that movie run

#s25
But I mean time wise how long

#s26
was it two hour

#s28
or

#s30
Uh-huh

#s31
Okay

#s32
okay

#s34
That always seems to happen when you rent them you know

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
uh-huh

#s40
and uh it

#s42
Was it oh good

#s43
Uh-huh

#s46
Oh great

#s48
Oh well I 'm looking forward to seeing that one

#s49
That was next on our list

#s50
so uh

#s53
Okay

#s54
okay

#s55
good deal

#s57
good deal

#s58
Do you rent movies very often

#s59
or

#s62
Right

#s63
Right

#s65
That 's exactly right

#s67
Uh-huh

#s68
uh-huh

#s71
Yeah

#s72
right

#s73
right

#s75
Oh gosh

#s76
Yeah

#s77
yeah

#s78
And we usually have

#s79
oh we do n't get out as much as we like

#s80
We have two children

#s81
so we occasionally get out to the movies

#s83
but uh it 's it 's fun it 's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once

#s86
Uh-huh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s90
What ages are they

#s91
Have you found trouble finding movies for them

#s92
or

#s93
Right

#s97
Yeah

#s98
yeah

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
uh-huh

#s103
Uh-oh uh-oh yeah

#s105
They have been doing that

#s106
We 've been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see

#s107
The last one they saw was HOME ALONE

#s108
and uh they enjoyed that

#s109
but uh I missed that one

#s110
My husband took the kids to see that one

#s111
so

#s115
Uh-huh

#s116
Yeah

#s117
yeah

#s118
well that 's a good deal

#s122
Okay

#s123
let me think if I have rented that one

#s125
Harrison Ford

#s126
and how does the story line go

#s129
Oh okay

#s130
we have n't seen that one

#s134
Uh-huh

#s135
uh-huh

#s137
Oh gosh

#s138
oh gosh

#s142
Uh-huh

#s143
I think that 's the one I wanted to pick up the other day

#s144
and then my husband was n't going to be able to watch it with me

#s145
so I thought I better save that one for another day

#s147
Yeah

#s148
because I think he 'd like that one

#s150
You enjoyed that one then

#s154
Uh-huh

#s155
okay

#s156
well that 's a good one to put on the list

#s161
Uh-huh

#s163
Right

#s164
okay

#s166
Uh-huh

#s168
Uh-huh

#s169
okay

#s170
Uh-huh

#s171
uh-huh

#s173
I do n't think too many of them are anymore

#s174
It 's it 's a shame

#s175
but uh

#s178
I know

#s180
Oh no

#s181
Oh

#s186
Oh gosh

#s187
Yeah

#s188
we 've heard about that one

#s189
but we have n't seen that one either

#s190
So well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies

#s193
Oh God

#s197
Right

#s198
Right

#s199
right

#s200
I agree

#s201
I agree

#s203
That 's for sure

#s205
Well you too Jim

#s208
Thanks for punching in

#s209
and uh

#s211
I hope you see a good movie soon

#s213
