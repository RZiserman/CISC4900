#s1
Okay

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Oh great

#s9
Great

#s10
well my children are grown

#s11
but they 're teenagers

#s13
so I have three children um fifteen ages fifteen seventeen and twenty

#s15
and um about I guess about when the first when the youngest one was in kindergarten I started working at a preschool and uh you know doing some work

#s17
and then I I took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool

#s18
so so I am around not a day care situation but in the you know in the child care environment

#s21
so um

#s23
Uh-huh

#s26
Yeah

#s28
Yes

#s30
Uh-huh

#s31
Oh it is

#s33
Yeah

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
Yeah

#s36
in other words there 're more people

#s38
Yes

#s39
yes

#s40
That 's that 's an interesting point of view

#s41
I uh you know

#s42
seeing the children in the school the way I do I I mean I see the ones that we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides for the you know for the under three year olds

#s49
but still they have an op- an opportunity to be with other children

#s51
and it is true

#s52
and uh I but I think that would but as far as looking for a place you know I the criteria I mean I think it 's very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the

#s55
in a school if you 're going to have the structure and you 're going to have the large numbers you 're going to need really

#s64
Yes

#s65
yes

#s67
Yes

#s68
it is

#s70
Yes

#s71
that 's right

#s72
that maybe

#s73
Yeah

#s74
that maybe have another salary in their family that where they can do that

#s76
and that 's what I had the opportunity of you know doing

#s78
and and I could concentrate on the creativity and and you know really having a lot of fun with the children and and providing them with a great atmosphere

#s81
Yeah

#s84
And they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning

#s86
which is

#s87
yeah

#s90
Yeah

#s91
Yes

#s92
that 's true

#s93
that 's true

#s95
Yeah

#s96
yeah

#s98
because people ca n't pay to provide and

#s101
well ours is not you know ours is just is a church

#s102
and so we we do n't have the the expenses of a building you know

#s104
we share the expense with the church

#s105
but we do n't have enough

#s107
you know taking care of a whole building and that responsibility

#s109
So uh it is it is a lot different

#s113
Oh my goodness

#s115
Yeah

#s116
yeah

#s118
Uh-huh

#s125
Yes

#s127
Oh you did

#s128
Um

#s129
Yeah

#s130
yeah

#s132
Uh-huh

#s133
Yes

#s134
yes

#s136
Uh-huh

#s137
uh-huh

#s138
Yeah

#s140
Well that 's different than most people do it

#s141
I mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school you know

#s148
But uh

#s157
Yeah

#s158
Yes

#s159
that 's true

#s164
Uh-huh

Yeah

#s173
