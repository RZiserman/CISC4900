#s2
Yeah

#s3
In fact I 'm still going

#s6
Uh well I do n't know about that

#s7
but I in fact I 'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school

#s11
Uh well computer science and cognitive science

#s13
So

#s16
Oh I see

#s19
Oh yeah

#s21
Yeah

#s26
To a parent

#s28
Well you know the thing is when you 're a kid

#s29
and the kid at that age especially if they 're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want

#s32
An and I mean choosing from my experience you know I thought you know my I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want

#s34
But uh I do n't know

#s35
at the same time you have to decide what is important about the school

#s36
you know the size of it or

#s39
Yeah

#s46
Yeah

#s51
Yeah

#s52
That 's disruptive

#s61
Oh yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s64
Well yeah

#s65
I see what you 're saying

#s68
Yeah

#s70
Uh give me five minutes

#s73
Yeah

#s76
Yeah

#s77
I 'm just getting ready to go to lunch

#s78
Uh yeah

#s79
that 's like what we were saying though

#s80
would you uh advise a private school or a public school

#s82
you know what 's the trade off there

#s83
what

#s91
Oh I see

#s100
Yeah

#s103
Yeah

#s104
yeah

#s105
I think uh I would agree with that

#s106
In fact the thing that I 'm going through the same thing where in graduate school I was trying to choose

#s108
You know a particular institution might be better for my area

#s111
yet like say you know the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area

#s114
Yet if I go to U of I or C M U or you know some you know any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better

#s115
but it 's the same thing

#s116
there 's you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing

#s121
Yeah

#s122
yeah

#s123
That 's that 's usually the basic criteria

#s127
Yeah

#s133
Oh

#s139
Yeah

#s142
Yeah

#s145
Yeah

#s157
Yeah

#s160
Yeah

#s161
yeah

#s163
Yeah

#s168
Yeah

#s169
Yeah

#s170
I I guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that job market

#s171
and uh um where was I at

#s172
Oh go- in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school

#s173
but there is also a whole other dimension I mean the growing up while you 're going to school part

#s176
And uh actually in the Midwest especially a lot of the schools have like University of Missouri will have a main campus like Columbia which is big multi disciplinary

#s178
and they 'll have a satellite campus in a usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field

#s179
So you 've really uh I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything

#s185
Yeah
