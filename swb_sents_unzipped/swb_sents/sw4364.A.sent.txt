So do you your privacy being invaded at any time

#s4
yo-

#s5
Right

#s9
Yeah

#s10
Yeah

#s11
Now th- that y- s- you can still

#s12
yeah

#s13
I 've always done that

#s14
I started

#s15
once I found out that that 's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse

#s16
and I say what are you going to do

#s17
You going to say you do n't want to sell me this product then that 's fine

#s19
I 'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all

#s20
And then ultimately they say no

#s21
you do n't have to put it down

#s22
But uh really it 's part of this compliance thing

#s24
Uh the thing I do n't like

#s25
I know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles

#s27
That really burns me because hey you 're required

#s28
You have to do that

#s30
And nowhere does it say you h- asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone

#s32
And I think that it it 's one thing to uh voluntarily give it because someone asks

#s33
You can always refuse

#s34
but it 's another thing where it 's required by law

#s35
and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody You know

#s38
I do n't think I do n't think they have the right to do that

#s51
Well that 's easy

#s52
Whenever you donate money to someone

#s54
They you become put on something like a sucker list

#s55
and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations

#s57
And then you s- y-

#s58
it kind of makes you feel MUMBLEx from doing it again

#s60
Like uh National Public Radio or any of these the public uh stations you know

#s62
I I I I think I sent in in money for f- once to uh to public uh T V

#s64
And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine

#s66
I

#s67
it 's like

#s68
and it just started soon after I had done that one

#s70
And I just said this is this is terrible

#s71
Uh and that 's also happened to me where I 've given money to my old Alma Mater in college

#s73
And uh it 's one thing

#s74
they do n't sell the list

#s75
But the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people

#s76
th- the people do these phonathons

#s78
and they call you up

#s79
and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that

#s80
And and they say oh we we know you

#s81
You uh had uh contributed x amount last year

#s82
Can you do better this year

#s83
And you know like hold on here

#s85
Who how do you know that

#s86
Why why you even telling me this

#s87
Is it any of your business

#s88
I mean it 's one thing that I and the college knows that

#s89
that 's just our business

#s90
There 's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all

#s92
Just uh

#s93
and that was very offensive too

#s94


#
and so

#s97
Uh-huh

#s98
Right

#
