Hello

#s3
My name is Nola

#s4
I 'm in Plano Texas

#s8
Not too far away

#s12
I 've had some from Plano too

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Okay

#s18
um let 's see

#s20
Social changes

#s22
That sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties I guess

#s24
Think we can handle that

#s30
Okay uh shall I go ahead and push one

#s33
Okay

#s34
You want to go ahead and start

#s37
Oh

#s40
That involves a lot of different areas I think

#s45
Yeah

#s46
there is a a big difference in the uh economic um status of uh people although I think that has been true uh always

#s48
Um perhaps there 's less of the middle range then there was

#s55
Uh

#s57
I think uh m- in my situation

#s58
I have three children

#s59
and we 're uh home schooling

#s60
So education you know things that relate t- to education um are things that I think about a lot

#s61
Um I think that and I think that involves social changes a lot

#s62
Uh for instance I think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that are happening socially in the world around them and in in t- because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather More not than are And children being put in day-care centers from very early

#s63
and and I think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day-care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes

#s64
Because of the way children are being raised they 're not learning the values they need to learn

#s66
And they 're not um th- they do n't have the self-esteem that they need to have

#s67
and they do n't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world

#s68
And uh I think we 're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang gang things that are happening

#s69
and and um

#s76
Yeah

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Oh it 's

#s80
That 's really sad

#s81
I think that a lot of people

#s82
and they think they have to

#s83
but

#s85
I I think that if they really tried they would n't have to

#s86
And I I think that if they did n't that and it became more of the standard not to that uh I do n't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home You know And have a more solid uh foundation for the kids

#s93
That 's right

#s94
It 's already It already costs society much more because of it

#s95
You know it

#s96
trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those You would n't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know

#s98
Um there 's

#s99
and I think uh a lot of it is selfishness

#s100
People have become very selfish

#s101
They do n't want to stay home with the kids or something like that

#s103
There are a lot of two parent um situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants to do you know

#s105
Rather than that she has to have the money particularly

#s106
Or maybe there 's a small need for money

#s107
so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too You know

#s112
Home school

#s114
Yeah

#s116
No

#s117
I I have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler And one on the way

#s121
Yes

#s122
Yes

#s124
And I think uh it 's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while I think

#s125
Home schooling 's always been around

#s126
but uh I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools

#s127
Um and a lot of it is discipline problems

#s129
A lot of it is

#s130
and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers

#s131
It it 's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things That um they 've been raised in a day-care center

#s136
Well I think it 's going to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else

#s139
The home is the base

#s140
it 's the basic unit

#s141
And that 's the where it all starts

#s142
and if we do n't start making changes in the homes

#s143
and maybe part of that is educating parents better

#s145
And educating uh you know

#s147
I know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what family life is like and the uh you know and uh that kind of thing

#s148
but uh
