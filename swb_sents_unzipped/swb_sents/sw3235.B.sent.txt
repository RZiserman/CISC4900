That 's a tough question

#s3
We are now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework

#s4
Right

#s5
Do n't ask me

#s8
Well it has no credibility any more

#s11
Well I 'm a school teacher

#s12
and I 'm in charge of raising them

#s13
so I can appreciate it

#s18
Oh good for you

#s19
good for you

#s21
Well you know it 's interesting because when I heard the topic I was thinking uh

#s22
this summer Oprah had a T V show about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible

#s24
and one woman had four children

#s25
and her husband said she was n't pulling her own weight in the family

#s28
that 's frightening

#s31
and it you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue you know

#s33
people were siding with the husband saying You 've got to go to work

#s34
if you have these four children you 've got to support them

#s35
and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them

#s39
That 's true

#s43
That 's true

#s48
Yeah

#s49
well you know I as I said I teach school

#s51
and gosh I 'm trying to think

#s52
I do n't know

#s53
I have one woman one mother that I know is home

#s54
but she also has ten children

#s56
Six seven and eight

#s61
In Richardson

#s64
Oh okay

#s69
Oh yeah

#s71
I 've got one child um that stays with me every day until five because his mother does n't come home until seven

#s72
and he does n't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Well he stays with me

#s78
and I have a tendency to work late

#s79
I work until six

#s81
so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home

#s83
and you know I have lots of kids because they know I 'm there late

#s85
I 'm a slow mover to say the least

#s86
but um they 'll come in and say Can I stay with you because I do n't want to go home to an empty house

#s87
And that 's frightening because you know the

#s88
when I said I I 'm I 'm raising them I am

#s89
because we 're talking about boy friends

#s90
and we 're talking about what the girl said in class and you know what 's right because there 's no mother at home

#s93
and um it makes a difference

#s94
I

#s95
and just the social values

#s99
I I do n't know

#s100
I I have a feeling we 're going to go more and more

#s101
I 've got a twenty-one year old female

#s102
and I 've got twenty-two year old male chil- child children

#s103
and I listen to my daughter

#s104
and she 's going to work

#s105
and she 's going to buy her house

#s106
and she 's going to get her car

#s107
and then she 's going to have her children

#s108
and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their life-style is

#s110
And they 're back to work

#s111
and you know I agree with you

#s112
I was raised in a generation we did n't need all those things

#s114
and we lived without them

#s115
we did fine
