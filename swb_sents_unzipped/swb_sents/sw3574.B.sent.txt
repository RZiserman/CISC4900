We we we have a terrible air pollution problem

#s4
Our summers are extremely uh hazardous

#s6
and during uh certain wind directions because we get the uh Gary Indiana Chicago pollution

#s9
and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake

#s12
And they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season

#s14
In the winter it 's not as severe

#s16
But uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad

#s18
Uh the State of Wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting

#s20
Uh I do n't think it 's going to go very far

#s21
but it it was uh a way of uh triggering uh awareness

#s24
So what 's the conditions like in Dallas

#s31
Um

#s33
Wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for uh their pollution control equipment

#s35
and if they do n't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it it is drivable

#s37
So they 've they 've tried to do a lot of that

#s39
and I thi-

#s40
you know there seem to be at least in certain little pockets

#s41
and we were talking earlier about Madison

#s43
Madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in Wisconsin

#s45
and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states

#s48
And there is a a real promotion of of biking

#s50
but um there are still a lot of people who insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere

#s52
I find that a little irritating because I do n't think it 's always so necessary

#s60
Send send them to Wisconsin

#s61
and we 'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from uh the uh acid rain

#s64
and they 'll they 'll they may wake up you know

#s66
how 'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain

#s69
It 's uh really a serious issue for those of us up in this uh sector up up here

#s72
I think it 's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of of the Gary area

#s75
and uh I do n't know exactly where it emerges from when it it 's up in the uh northern sectors of Wisconsin

#s77
that causes the acid rain

#s78
That I 'm a little uncertain of

#s79
but I do know that uh it is a problem
