Well Jackie uh on taxes I I guess I would have to say that I that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes

#s2
Uh what 's your feeling about that

#s5
Right

#s6
uh where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both

#s9
Uh uh-huh

#s10
In New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes

#s11
No income tax and no sales tax

#s13
Uh we tax business uh eight percent

#s14
businesses are taxed eight percent

#s15
and we have what we call the five B s Uh for our taxes Booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling

#s18
So uh we do have a very low tax rate

#s19
but you know combined with the federal income tax I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes

#s20
MUMBLEx

#s28
Uh-huh

#s31
Well that 's nice

#s34
Nice nice to get a refund

#s39
Uh-huh

#s40
Do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we are getting value for it

#s42
Yeah

#s43
Uh my my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state and they say they are going to send some back

#s44
it 's like giving yourself a tra- it 's like one arm giving the other a transfusion

#s46
You know what I mean

#s48
Uh it it really uh

#s49
I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because

#s50
Right

#s51
because uh there 's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there 's a fly paper effect

#s54
and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first

#s55
and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there

#s56
and not that much comes back to you

#s64
Uh-huh

#s72
That it

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
Well it does it it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend

#s77
Uh it 's almost like they will spend as much as the they 're allowed to collect You know

#s79
Uh there is an interesting proposal that 's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax Uh ten percent or thirteen percent

#s80
There would be no figuring

#s81
I mean you would take your income tax

#s82
you would have a certain amount

#s83
I mean you would take you total salary

#s85
those who made under a certain amount would n't owe any taxes

#s86
and then there would be a set amount for however many people you know dependent you have

#s87
and you would just pay a flat tax No exemptions no deductions or anything else after you know after you figure up who 's in your family

#s90
And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S

#s91
and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with

#s94
Yeah

#s96
I I 'd like to see something like that

#s97
I think it would be fairer

#s98
and it would put a you know a lot of the tax attorneys our of business

#s99
and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail

#s100
but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans

#s103
I mean it does n't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes

#s106
It does n't seem fair to me

#s111
Right

#s114
I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high I I if I am not mistaken are n't they

#s115
I mean for your state

#s117
What is do you know what your state income tax rate is

#s119
Twenty percent

#s123
Just you just pay it huh

#s125
You 're like you 're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts

#s126
and uh she works as a waitress

#s127
and she is attending college full time also

#s129
and she sends her taxes to me

#s130
and I figure them up

#s131
She really has no idea

#s132
She gets a refund check

#s133
and
