#s1
Okay

#s2
go ahead

#s5
Yeah

#s7
Do n't do it

#s8
Well I tell you I I firmly believe in exercising

#s9
I think it 's a

#s10
I do it every day on a regular basis

#s11
I

#s13
Well I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles

#s14
but this time of year you ca n't get much biking in

#s15
Uh but every morning I use this President 's uh council of physical fitness

#s16
and it really is uh uh it 's worth doing

#s17
and you can do it anywhere

#s18
I I travel quite a bit in my in my business

#s20
and you can do it you know wherever you 're at

#s21
and if you do it

#s22
I I do it every morning after uh usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work

#s25
And uh now what I do

#s26
I mean I 've done this for you know like fifteen years

#s27
so you do n't start at this kind of regiment you know

#s29
I

#s30
so what I 'm telling you is n't something you go out and do

#s31
and and you 'll hurt yourself

#s32
Uh every every uh

#s33
it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time

#s34
but I uh I do twenty-five uh uh where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch right you know left and right toe

#s36
and I do uh ten uh right and left uh trunk twisters

#s38
And I do uh about sixty uh bicycle type uh leg thrust type things

#s40
And I do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side You know when you 're p- laying on the floor

#s44
And then I do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups

#s45
and uh then I do about uh

#s48
Oh yeah

#s49
oh yeah

#s50
And then uh thirty uh

#s51
now if you did football like the old grass drills where you 're on your stomach and you

#s53
you know prone type things where you 're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing

#s54
and that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes uh in the morning

#s61
Well uh

#s63
Years ago I used to uh referee football

#s65
and uh to stay in condition I did that uh just as a normal basis

#s67
and uh uh I tell you just by doing it uh

#s68
well example this summer I I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be

#s69
so I I increased

#s70
I do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning

#s71
I do a hundred then

#s72
and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed

#s74
I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles

#s76
and you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want

#s77
but you do n't you know

#s78
within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being

#s81
and uh I just you know

#s82
you 're ready to go at a

#s83
I I I think it 's really important

#s85
Good

#s87
Well that 's why Chuck I think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you did n't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like

#s89
well I I like biking

#s90
and during the summer I 'll do you know at least seventy-five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty

#s92
but you ca n't you know

#s94
there 's excuses weather

#s96
or you do n't have time or something like that

#s97
But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you 're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour

#s98
And you get up a half hour earlier

#s101
and once you start getting into that one you just feel good

#s103
and you look a whole lot better

#s106
or

#s107
Unfortunately not

#s108
and there 's no way I can get her to

#s109
Uh-huh

#s110
It 's a like it 's something you either just really want to do it or you ca n't talk anyone into it

#s111
If you do n't like to exercise you know it is n't going to happen

#s114
I I sure wish she would

#s115
She 's you know unfortunately overweight

#s116
and but she 's a wonderful woman

#s117
and you know no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it

#s124
No problem at all

#s125
And uh if you get one of these mats You know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these A B C -s of physical fitness on them

#s126
Yeah

#s127
One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year

#s128
and uh

#s130
It it it 's just an exercise mat that rolls up so you can put it up you know just in the corner

#s132
Well yeah

#s133
you can do that

#s135
But but it does n't

#s136
Yeah

#s137
it 's a foam thing

#s138
yeah

#s139
Yeah

#s140
Yeah

#s141
and it 's it 's just about six feet long rolls up

#s143
and I do n't take it on trips with me

#s144
I you could

#s145
but uh I do n't mind uh you know

#s146
if I do like sit ups I 'll throw a a towel down or something You know

#s147
Yeah

#s148
so you do n't have the abrasive
