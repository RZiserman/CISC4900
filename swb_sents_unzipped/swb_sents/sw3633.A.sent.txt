MUMBLEx return anything

#s4
Right

#s6
Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee

#s7
yeah

#s8
The only thing I 've had lately is uh my kids got all these Barbie kind of toys for uh Christmas

#s9
and uh i- it takes them less than a day

#s10
and they 're broken in one way or another

#s11
But I do n't know if that 's just kids or if that 's uh

#s12
maybe those type of products sh- should be for older kids

#s15
I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them

#s17
And uh I do n't think they 're unduly rough

#s18
but maybe they are

#s19
I do n't know

#s20
But uh a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real little pieces

#s21
and they 're easily lost and easily broken

#s22
but

#s24
MUMBLEx

#s27
It 's been a while since they 've uh gone through the Barbie stuff MUMBLEx

#s31
Right

#s34
Do n't remember her breaking uh

#s39
Well that 's one thing they 've got

#s40
They 've got every type of imaginable

#s41
camping on the beach and all of these come with oh like tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses

#s42
And uh

#s44
my three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll

#s45
and so I finally got her a Ken doll

#s46
and uh less than a week later the arm was broken

#s48
But they were real good about replacing it

#s49
That 's one nice thing is they 're real good about replacing it

#s51
Right

#s52
Well the the you know those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way

#s53
and

#s55
she 's not that strong that I would she 's not that big of a girl that I think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could you know

#s60
Yes

#s62
That was about it

#s64
And the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff

#s65
but

#s68
Oh is that right

#s71
Well do you see that there 's a big problem with electronic things

#s77
Do n't buy them because you do n't need them

#s78
Yes

#s82
Oh yeah

#s83
MUMBLEx

#s85
Yes

#s86
Well you almost assume if you 're going to have problems with it it 's usually bef- before that warranty would expire

#s87
any

#s88
the first one

#s92
You never nee- even needed it

#s99
It 's time to replace it

#s101
Yes

#s103
I think these extended warranties are gimmicks really

#s105
A lot of it

#s106
We bought when we first married we bought one on our T V

#s107
and that there 's

#s108
it was a five year after the first five years

#s109
and it was ridiculous

#s112
Yes

#s113
They 're a pretty healthy price

#s114
and you 're trying to think oh maybe I 'll need this

#s115
You never you always think gosh if I say no then I wo n't you know

#s117
But

#s119
I do n't know

#s122
You probably got your worth out of it anyway

#s128
Yes

#s129
the little

#s130
well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy

#s131
and the when you do buy things you probably watch what kind of type of MUMBLEx

#s133
Yes
