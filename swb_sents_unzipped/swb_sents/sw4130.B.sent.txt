#s2
I think we need we definitely need more of it definitely

#s6
Oh yeah

#s7
yeah

#s8
for certain

#s10
Exactly

#s12
Exactly

#s13
Does does like d- do health insurance policies like for companies and things

#s14
do they cover diseases like that

#s17
Uh-huh

#s22
Um well that 's but that 's why they should have s- started doing stuff before

#s23
I mean still you know since it 's dormant for such a long time there 's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now You know

#s26
Right

#s27
Right

#s29
Right

#s30
and all these God-fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera

#s36
Uh

#s37
Yeah

#s39
Boy

#s40
that 's a good one

#s42
Yes

#s44
No

#s45
I really do n't

#s46
I did I did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff

#s47
and uh really we 're not doing much at all

#s48
I mean most of what gets raised I mean it 's not really federal movement

#s49
most of what gets raised gets raised by uh uh you know conscious yeah communities and things like that you know

#s52
Like uh San Francisco has a a real uh strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff

#s53
and and uh get they get donations from the community you know they 're real And from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing

#s56
and uh I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it 's you know where it 's predominated so far because it 's you know it 's bound to spread

#s59
Right

#s60
Yeah

#s61
I do n't know

#s62
I do n't know

#s63
I I I do n't know what the likelihood of that is

#s64
but I mean you know people really waking up

#s66
Especially with the ultra conservatives move our our political system s- sort of seems to be taking

#s70
Yeah

#s71
so

#s73
God

#s74
that 's a good question Fish

#s75
I do n't know

#s76
uh I think I think one of the main things that 's really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know

#s79
and it 's really it 's really not necessary uh until until the disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious

#s81
and uh I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what they 're going through and everything and try to understand that they 're not you know they do n't they do n't have to be just completely cut off from from the community

#s84
and that and uh I do n't know

#s85
I guess I think that that uh research is I guess the most important just because I you know it it really needs to come to an end You know

#s87
I do n't know

#s88
I do n't know Fish

#s89
What do you think about that subject
