Okay

#s2
I guess it took

#s3
so I guess the recording has started now

#s5
Uh

#s7
I served

#s8
I was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury

#s9
A lot of the same rules apply

#s10
Have you ever served on one

#s15
Uh-huh

#s19
Was it civil or criminal

#s21
A grand jury or

#s22
Uh-huh

#s25
I see

#s29
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences

#s33
or did you folks do that

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
Um

#s44
No

#s47
That that 's a science in itself

#s52
Uh-huh

#s53
I see

#s54
Because you 'd probably be uh too puritanical

#s55
and

#s58
MUMBLEx

#s61
Uh-huh

#s62
So uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair

#s63
or would

#s64
if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different

#s69
Huh

#s73
Um

#s75
Wow

#s76
I bet that made him happy

#s83
Right

#s86
Uh-huh

#s90
Yeah

#s91
Oh how many members were on the jury

#s92
Was it a six or twelve member jury

#s94
Uh-huh

#s96
That 's kind of curious to me

#s97
I did n't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh a few months ago that they had six member juries

#s98
I thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak

#s100
But uh apparently for some some crimes it 's permissible to have six people sit in judgment

#s102
I know on a

#s103
getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it does n't require the jury to be unanimous

#s104
It 's a simple majority you know rules

#s107
MUMBLEx

#s110
Probably on capital

#s111
I do n't know

#s112
we were n't we

#s113
the two that I were on had to do with drugs

#s115
and uh we were uh unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things

#s116
the government really failed to prove its case

#s117
and you know being fair to the person if the government does n't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what 's offered as proof

#s118
and we had to acquit him in both cases

#s120
Uh yeah

#s121
it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off- special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person

#s122
but something happened to the camera and the tape and

#s124
all they could do was testify
