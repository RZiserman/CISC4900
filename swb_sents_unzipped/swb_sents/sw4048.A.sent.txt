Drug testing in the work place

#s5
Um I 've been tested a few times just before pre- drug employment

#s6
But that 's about it

#s7
I 've never had random drug testing

#s11
Oh really

#s16
Uh-huh

#s19
Oh they do with alcohol

#s21
They do it with alcohol

#s25
Oh I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine

#s28
Huh That 's interesting

#s31
What type of field of work are you in

#s33
Oh in the oil business

#s35
Okay

#s36
and you work in the office around

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
Yeah

#s42
see I work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars

#s45
and we work around a lot of explosives

#s47
Yeah

#s48
so that 's you know

#s49
I 'm all for it because the well the type of environment I work in you know they 're working with explosives

#s50
and so they could blow up the whole

#s51
well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use

#s52
but still it can be dangerous

#s57
Yeah

#s62
Now do they fire them

#s63
or do they

#s68
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s71
Oh wow

#s73
Huh that 's

#s74
I think our policy is that

#s75
all right it 's probably the same thing

#s76
I 'm not really sure what the

#s81
That 's right

#s82
But I know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance

#s83
but I 'm not sure if if it 's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits

#s95
Uh-huh

#s98
Uh-huh

#s101
You could time it just right

#s105
I know one employee I know when I was working with he had alcohol on his breath

#s106
and I 'm not sure if our policy covers that or not

#s107
That 'd be just as dangerous

#s110
Huh That 's true

#s112
Uh-huh

#s113
Do they give any limits on alcohol

#s114
or is it

#s122
Oh

#s126
Uh-huh
