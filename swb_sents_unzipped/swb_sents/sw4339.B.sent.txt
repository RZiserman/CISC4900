Uh fantasizing about

#s6
Ca n't do it right now

#s7
Our situation is that we 're a two car family

#s9
and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago

#s11
It 's got a uh five year loan

#s12
so that 's still got a couple years to run

#s14
and the car I get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that 's going to be ten years old next month

#s15
so I think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years if I can

#s19
Well since I just turned forty I 'm thinking about a forty year old man 's car something uh something real sporty

#s21
but uh realistically with uh the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh would n't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat

#s23
Something a little seating room

#s24
How about you

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Sure

#s35
Sure

#s41
Yeah

#s42
I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back

#s43
so they 've got some pretty powerful sixes

#s45
And uh you know V eights seem to be a return to the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon

#s54
Sure

#s55
Is uh traction much of an issue for you up there

#s57
MUMBLEx

#s61
Actually uh pretty good way of looking at it

#s62
yeah

#s63
We uh we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago

#s65
A case where there was a sort of freak ice storm

#s66
and we were n't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car

#s67
and this is a rear wheel drive model

#s68
So we got some monster studded snow tires after that

#s70
Have n't had any problems since

#s72
It 's a Mazda

#s75
And uh we 're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh driveability

#s76
Fuel economy is n't great being a mini van

#s77
but uh it 's real nice for carrying around our kids and others

#s78
and it 's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around

#s80
so we 've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
Right

#s88
Yeah

#s89
I think that we 're going to be uh owning a mini van for some years to come

#s90
Probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway

#s94
Uh I 'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra

#s96
And even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it 's it 's done pretty well in winter

#s98
uh again like you if conditions are are that bad I probably do n't want to be driving anyway

#s100
So I know I 'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door

#s101
You know again we 've we 've got the same issue with getting kids into the
