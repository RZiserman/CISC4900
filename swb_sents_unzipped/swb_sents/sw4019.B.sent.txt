#s2
Yeah

#s3
I do

#s5
I 've got a male Siamese about a year old here

#s6
I live alone in an apartment and uh except for the cat

#s9
How about you

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Well it 's uh you know

#s15
they 're just uh aggressive by nature

#s17
and uh he 's been neutered and declawed

#s18
so he 's an indoor cat

#s20
so uh that kind of calms him down for the most part

#s21
How about yours

#s24
Huh

#s26
And and you say you 've had him how long

#s28
Two years

#s33
Huh

#s35
Does he bite her enough to draw blood

#s40
Uh-huh

#s45
Yeah

#s48
Huh

#s50
Yeah

#s54
Yeah

#s55
boy

#s56
I guess

#s57
Well as long as he does n't get too aggressive I guess with the daughter he 's all right

#s59
You would n't want him to carry her off or something

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Sure

#s67
Yeah

#s68
yeah

#s70
Is that the only pet that you have

#s77
Well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh

#s82
I see

#s86
Sure

#s88
No

#s89
no

#s90
I I live alone in an apartment

#s91
and uh it 's it 's not that big that uh

#s93
although I 've heard rabbits are pretty good

#s95
you know I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses

#s98
and they apparently uh

#s99
especially when they 're young when they bring them in

#s101
uh

#s103
I guess

#s104
I guess

#s105
yeah

#s106
and I would imagine that they do n't have many more than one to start with either

#s111
Yep

#s112
that 's right

#s114
Did you see the the C N N the the dog show uh

#s117
I see

#s118
Well they have uh uh a Wesmin- they call it the Westminster Dog Show uh

#s119
I think it 's in New York City at the at the Gardens

#s120
there once a year live

#s122
and they had that on last week

#s123
and that 's really kind of something to watch uh

#s125
it 's on I think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two

#s127
and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there

#s129
Some of them are really beautiful too

#s131
So

#s133
So you live in Utah do you

#s137
Goodness

#s141
Uh-huh

#s145
Uh-huh

#s147
Well do you all work for T I or for

#s151
Yeah

#s152
yeah

#s153
yeah

#s155
This is the very first one I 've I 've talked to

#s160
Uh-huh
