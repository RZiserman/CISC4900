Okay

#s2
I 'm here

#s3
How do you feel about public schools

#s5
Uh-huh

#s8
Yeah

#s10
Uh-huh

#s11
Right

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Well that 's interesting

#s16
I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw Georgia

#s18
And uh she has a young boy Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there

#s19
And she complained quite a bit about their school system there

#s21
And

#s23
Right

#s25
Right

#s26
I 'm

#s27
I ca n't really say much about the schools up here

#s28
I really do n't come from here

#s30
I 'm only up here temporarily on an internship

#s31
but uh I live in Orlando Florida usually

#s33
And the schools down there from what I know are not bad

#s34
They 're pretty good

#s36
But I know that in some I know in a lot of rural areas they 're not that good

#s38
For example I have a brother in North Carolina

#s39
and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad Uh just terrible

#s42
Huh

#s44
Wow

#s47
That is slow

#s53
Uh-huh

#s56
What do you think 's wrong to cause that

#s59
Yeah

#s61
Uh-huh

#s64
Yeah

#s65
Perhaps

#s67
Yeah

#s69
Yeah

#s70
Yeah

#s71
that 's that 's one thing I worry about MUMBLEx

#s73
There you go

#s74
uh-huh

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Probably quite a few black people up there

#s79
and and

#s83
Oh is that right

#s87
Oh okay

#s91
Yeah

#s92
but you know it it 's

#s93
you do n't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever

#s94
but then again

#s96
Yeah

#s97
there is no denying that that

#s98
Sure you know

#s99
Teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who do n't understand especially if there 's not a very well developed special education program at the school

#s102
That 's right

#s103
you ca n't do that

#s105
Right

#s106
See I grew up in Nebraska

#s108
and the school that I went to there was fantastic

#s109
It

#s110
I I really consider myself very very lucky

#s111
Uh we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you 're talking twenty-seven thirty kids to sc- to a class

#s113
But

#s115
Yeah

#s116
We zipped right along you know

#s117
I I was I was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily

#s121
Uh

#s122
Uh-huh

#s123
But you 're right you know

#s124
With all this do n't hurt the kids and do n't abuse their rights you 've also taken something away from the discipline I think

#s127
Yeah

#s129
Right

#s130
I was going to ask you if there if that was an option
