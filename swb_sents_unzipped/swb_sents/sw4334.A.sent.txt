Type of music is hot down in Texas

#s8
Oh okay

#s9
Uh mostly folk music

#s11
Yeah

#s12
I find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or New England uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up

#s15
Okay

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
Yeah

#s19
what about uh classic rock type stations

#s23
Oh okay

#s24
So some some of the older Eagles stuff was good

#s27
I I did n't like uh

#s28
they started getting a little more you know

#s29
the type of music at least to me it 's uh sounds like it 's only sounds good at a high volumes

#s30
and I do n't like listening at high volumes

#s33
But uh some of their older s- stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me

#s36
You know Ho- Hotel California and that era

#s40
Yeah

#s44
Well down in Texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then

#s48
I 'm sure there 's a lot of that down there

#s53
Well there there 's a Conway Twitty twang

#s54
then there 's the uh Dolly Parton uh Hollywood sound

#s58
Yeah

#s62
Yeah

#s63
I think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts

#s70
Hey

#s71
I I I think most artists are in to make a few bucks

#s74
But they 're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do-

#s76
late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message

#s82
Yeah

#s83
I I do n't I do n't think Gun

#s84
at least to my mind Guns and Roses does n't have too much of a message too much to say

#s91
Uh-huh

#s97
Right

#s100
Right

#s104
Uh-huh

#s106
Yeah

#s107
i- i- it 's the artist not the merit

#s113
Yeah

#s114
Well I do n't know

#s115
I know for myself that uh for the most part I do n't know which artist is which

#s116
so I listen to a song

#s117
I either like the song

#s118
or I do n't like it

#s120
and then if I really like the song eventually I 'll figure out who it was

#s127
Well you have to figure out what to buy

#s128
or do you just buy along the same artist

#s133
Yeah

#s135
Yeah

#s136
so you keep buying the same artists until you do n't like an album

#s137
then you stop

#s142
Yeah

#s147
Yeah

#s148
see that 's one thing I like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know

#s149
there 's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey

#s151
And it 's very nice

#s152
you go into the coffee house

#s153
and you know an artist is there

#s154
and very often the artist will have a d- an album

#s155
and so if you like the artist you buy the album

#s157
So you definitely get to try before you buy

#s162
You know it

#s163
you you you do n't always quite get it right
