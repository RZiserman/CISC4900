Hi

#s4
Uh-huh

#s12
Any particular reason

#s20
Uh-huh

#s21
Huh

#s25
Uh-huh

#s30
I really do n't

#s31
I I I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest But assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas Uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty

#s35
and uh I guess you could explain it two ways

#s36
And and the cynical view is well these things are n't doing a very good job at all

#s37
And the view that I would rather take is that there 's a different amount of information you need when you 're particularly interested in a topic or uh particularly interested in buying something as a you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things

#s41
And I think the same thing is true with news

#s42
If you want to just have an idea as to what 's going on most papers a- and especially the better papers the the TIMES the WALL STREET JOURNAL the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea

#s45
If you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they 're not printing because the average person does n't need or want to know that much

#s51
Well I mean there 's there 's a reasonable question as to whether it 's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things

#s54
And most people think it is

#s55
and I can I can you know accept that some people think it 's not and can find better ways to use it

#s58
I do n't think it 's that high

#s60
I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but do n't spend the time to actually read a newspaper

#s62
And I think they 're saying well if something 's really important I 'll at least find out that it happened

#s64
And and that 's a that 's is a reasonable start

#s65
and for awhile I did n't read a newspaper when I came out here because I did n't find one that I liked

#s66
Uh and if something important happened it was covered on T V

#s67
and I could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about

#s69
And I imagine you get the same level of MUMBLEx

#s70
something that you cared about happened you 'd find out from friends or other channels

#s74
Clarence Thomas or

#s77
Right

#s80
Uh-huh

#s86
Yeah

#s87
I stayed as far away from those as I could

#s89
I decided I did n't want to waste the time

#s90
I had I guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings And afterwards decided that what I had gotten out of it just was n't worth the time I put in And that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out
