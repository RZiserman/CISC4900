Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do

#s5
I 'm I 'm a putterer

#s6
I chose that topic because I really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard

#s12
Oh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
We 've had a late fall

#s17
it seems like the weather

#s18
in fact today it 's really warm

#s19
and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up

#s20
but you know you need to pretty soon

#s24
Oh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
So now you have the chance to really create and and spread out

#s46
Uh-huh

#s50
The grass not growing so fast

#s55
Oh

#s59
Um

#s60
ours seems to have slowed down here

#s61
We 're not having to mow every week religiously

#s63
but we 're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out

#s65
I still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
But like today it 's eighty-five degrees

#s71
it 's really strange

#s74
But that 'll change real quick

#s77
We 'll wish we 'd planted bulbs and pansies already

#s80
Oh my gosh

#s84
Well Texas has gotten to where it 's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot

#s86
and we have ice storms every year

#s87
And there just are n't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes

#s89
Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they do n't make it through the two swings

#s93
Uh-huh

#s98
Well for the most part we do n't

#s99
but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold

#s100
Well the summers have gotten where they 're a lot hotter

#s102
but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around

#s103
We 've noticed that crepe myrtles do n't do as well as they used to and uh pittosporum

#s106
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time

#s108
you you really take a chance with them freezing

#s114
Uh-huh

#s120
Uh-huh

#s122
Except for the lack of trees out where we are

#s123
It was all cotton fields

#s125
and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it

#s128
Uh-huh

#s139
Um

#s140
Uh-huh
