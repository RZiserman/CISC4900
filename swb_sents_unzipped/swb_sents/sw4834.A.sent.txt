I guess I guess by what you said you 're you do n't feel your uh privacy has been inva- invaded anytime recently

#s5
Uh-huh

#s8
Right

#s10
Uh no

#s11
I would n't call it invading my privacy by any means

#s12
Uh you know I would

#s13
there there 's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know when you 're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot

#s14
and you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that

#s15
and it 's real hard to to tell them you know that you 're not interested

#s16
Or you do tell them you 're not interested

#s17
and they still keep asking you you know and keep badgering you about it

#s18
and that aggravates me

#s19
But I do n't know that you could call that invading of invading my privacy

#s20
because you know if we do n't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know I want my name unlisted or want my you know

#s22
It does n't

#s26
Uh-huh

#s30
Oh

#s35
Uh-huh

#s42
Uh-huh

#s45
Huh

#s47
Good grief

#s48
Well let me ask you about this

#s49
Here 's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately

#s50
My fiance received a bill from a a Lord and Taylor company

#s51
Uh you know they 're a they 're a department store

#s53
She received a bill from them uh that she had visited some sto-

#s54
and and I think it was there in Florida

#s55
maybe it was in Miami

#s56
That uh she had visited a store there

#s57
and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise

#s59
Uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving

#s61
Uh and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number

#s63
Uh and and I 've I 've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- you know

#s64
they use Joe Blow 's so- uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone 's credit

#s67
Huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Well y-

#s80
Yeah

#s83
Yeah

#s84
Well we got it cleared up eventually

#s85
What happened uh
