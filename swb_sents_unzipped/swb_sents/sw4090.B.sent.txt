#s4
Uh yes I am to uh both questions

#s7
Uh yeah

#s8
we do

#s9
We uh uh

#s10
basically there 's the you know the expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month

#s12
and we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet

#s13
and uh whatever is left uh after that we you know we sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for

#s17
So what do you do

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Wow

#s29
Yeah

#s33
Yeah

#s34
All allocated out

#s36
Yeah

#s44
All the checks

#s45
yeah

#s49
Right

#s50
Yeah

#s51
we found that uh it 's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses

#s53
We were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were uh spending uh money for things that you know

#s54
we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have

#s56
and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand

#s57
We thought it uh thought it to be really helpful

#s58
We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that

#s60
so

#s62
Yeah

#s66
That 's a lot of money

#s67
but

#s69
Yeah

#s71


#
Uh-huh

#s83
Yeah

#s84
the other the other thing that that we 've found that helps is you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit

#s86
it 's just to uh uh get up the money in advance and put it in uh uh so long as it was n't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever Just put it in uh in an envelope or whatever

#s88
and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount And then once that was gone well if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say oh it 's gone

#s94
So

#s97
We we have n't

#s98
We our our initial goal was just to retire debt uh completely retire debt for car payments and credit card uh credit card debt and all of that

#s101
We are just at a point where where we could start thinking about it

#s102
so

#s105
Yeah

#s106
Well I

#s108
Uh-huh

#s110
A student

#s113
Yeah

#s114
I am actually in the in the mas-
