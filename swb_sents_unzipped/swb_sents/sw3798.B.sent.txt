#s3
Well uh uh that 's something I 've thought a lot about

#s5
Uh I I work in a hospital

#s7
And I 've worked in the hospital for fifteen years

#s8
and I 've taken care of a few AIDS patients

#s10
Uh when they asked us did did we want to uh keep it the same or uh spend more spend less I think uh I think right now what they 're spending is adequate Uh my for my personal opinion Uh because I think it 's something that 's going to take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for

#s14
I do n't think it 's going to be that easy to come up with

#s16
or I think they already would have by now you know

#s18
And uh so I do n't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now

#s19
I think they 're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know

#s21
And uh what about you

#s23
I 'm not either

#s24
I 'm definitely not aware of how much

#s26
Uh that 's something I 've never really kept up with at all

#s29
Uh I do n't I 'm not sure uh

#s32
I know uh I 've always thought more about the disease rather than the research

#s33
you know what I mean

#s36
And uh that sort of thing

#s37
Uh if if we were talking about the money uh I 'd just have to say what they 're spending is probably enough simply because I do n't know that much about it You know

#s42
Oh yeah

#s44
I think so

#s45
I think so

#s47
Yeah

#s49
Yeah

#s50
Yeah

#s51
Well that 's true

#s52
That 's true because uh it 's a such an easily preventable disease

#s55
Uh

#s57
No

#s58
It 's definitely not

#s60
That 's true

#s61
that 's true

#s63
Uh

#s65
Myself uh uh I 'm just recently or about to get a divorce

#s67
and uh course I 'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything

#s69
But it 's sort of scary to find yourself single again you know

#s71
And uh because you never know what 's going to happen

#s72
You do n't know who you 're going to come across you know

#s74
Course it 's it 's not that I 'm wanting to I 'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see

#s76
But it 's something you got to think about these days

#s78
A single person You know

#s80
and uh I mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry

#s83
And uh

#s85
Certainly

#s87
Yeah

#s89
But uh uh I know that uh in some of these larger cities they 're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts wo n't be getting dirty needles and everything

#s94
And uh I do n't know

#s95
I do n't think that 's a bad idea

#s97
I know it uh sort of does n't address the problem of drug addiction

#s99
It just sort of keeps that going

#s101
But uh I do n't know

#s102
at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far can not be You know

#s104
so I do n't know

#s105
that I think that 's

#s106
I 'm not too a- much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself

#s108
I do n't know

#s109
what do you think about that

#s112
It It really is

#s114
It really is

#s115
They gave us a hard topic

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
That 's true

#s122
That 's true

#s124
Yeah

#s125
You know I guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first I guess as far as something to to do about it

#s129
So so I do n't know

#s130
Uh course there 's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know

#s132
And uh so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse Which is the most important to solve at the time

#s134
and

#s136
I do n't know

#s138
But uh but I 've never looked into how much money they 're spending

#s139
I have I have no idea

#s141
And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that

#s143
But uh I really have never looked into it

#s144
I have no idea

#s148
Yeah

#s149
Yeah

#s151
Right

#s152
sure

#s154
Yeah

#s156
Yeah

#s158
I think it is

#s159
I think it is

#s160
Yeah

#s161
it does every

#s163
It seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do

#s164
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would You know

#s167
But uh

#s169
That 's one thing I 've never really feared

#s171
Uh uh I

#s172
a lot of the my family you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions

#s173
but uh uh I do n't fear it at all

#s176
Uh I work in in the operating room a lot

#s178
and uh and of course when w-
