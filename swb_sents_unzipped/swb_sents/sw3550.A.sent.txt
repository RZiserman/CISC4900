#s1
Okay

#s3
Go ahead

#s5
Yeah

#s10
Oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Uh-huh

#s18
Oh really

#s20
Yeah

#s22
Uh-huh

#s23
What do you have now

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
Oh really

#s28
Yeah

#s29
we just we well I have

#s30
my car is the first one we ever bought new too

#s32
But we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually

#s38
Uh mine is a Honda Accord

#s42
Yeah

#s43
I do

#s44
and and um it 's funny because after I bought it I was doing a lot of business traveling

#s45
and I

#s46
some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors

#s48
and um I do n't like them as well except it was n't really a fair comparison because those were automatics

#s49
and mine is a standard

#s51
and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better

#s53
it had a lot more pickup and everything

#s56
Uh-huh

#s59
Um

#s60
usually AVIS

#s63
AVIS

#s65
Yeah

#s68
It 's just because we 're on

#s69
I think of it

#s70
I 'm not sure those are AVIS or not

#s71
but we have corporate contracts you know with the various companies

#s74
so it depends on your destination too

#s76
Kind of strange

#s78
Work for T I Uh-huh which is how I heard about this

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
Uh-huh

#s90
Oh really

#s92
It did

#s93
huh

#s96
Oh my gosh

#s99
Oh that was great

#s102
That 's unusual to hear

#s103
usually you know something breaks

#s104
you look at the warranty

#s105
and it 's excluded

#s108
Oh I see

#s109
okay

#s110
Oh you got your money 's worth

#s115
Yeah

#s116
Yeah

#s117
that is good

#s119
Yeah

#s120
well I 've been lucky

#s121
Mine has n't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it

#s123
but I was real lucky because it just hit the um the lens to the light

#s126
It did n't actually dent the car or anything

#s127
So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that

#s129
and the store will pay for it anyway

#s131
so No big deal

#s134
Um I probably would n't just because I already have one

#s136
but you know if I had to make the choice again I yeah I I 'm perfectly happy with what I decided um although we did just buy another car

#s138
and that 's a Legend

#s141
um but it 's it 's a used one

#s143
and um my husband has really wanted one for a long time

#s144
and the fact that you know this c- this car that I have has performed so well

#s145
and before that I also had an Accord

#s146
it was a real old one

#s148
and uh I bought that used

#s149
I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that

#s150
and it served me real well too

#s152
So he 's been impressed with all the Honda cars

#s154
And

#s159
Uh-huh

#s164
Yeah

#s170
Uh-huh

#s171
Uh-huh

#s173
Uh-huh

#s174
Yeah

#s176
How did it go for you

#s178
Has n't left you stranded

#s181
Yeah

#s182
I know

#s183
Yeah

#s187
Really

#s190
Huh

#s192
Well that 's what my husband thinks about my car now that he 's had the Legend

#s195
it 's windy

#s198
I ca n't drive that

#s199
the Legend it 's just so huge

#s201
I I do n't like it

#s202
and it 's so uh
