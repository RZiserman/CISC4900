#s1
Okay

#s2
what do you think is the biggest problem

#s4
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
Yeah

#s10
Is it the do you think it 's the values that they 're teaching in school or the values they get from home

#s19
Right

#s21
Yeah

#s22
I I I I think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the home environment being part of it

#s23
You know if

#s24
I think too many parents expect uh the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the st- to the kids and you know while we 're not going to worry about uh teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then expect them to pick it up at school

#s25
you 're not going to do that you know

#s26
you 're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home

#s27
and uh uh I think that that part of that showing up now you know with with things because kids I think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than we may have seen in the past uh

#s29
and part of it 's the the family I think

#s30
and part of it 's uh the living conditions of certain people are subjected too

#s31
drugs is a big problem now

#s32
and I think that 's that 's that 's another root problem

#s42
Uh-huh

#s47
Right

#s48
Right

#s50
Well I think it 's like you say it 's it 's the socioeconomic mix

#s51
there you know the they 're

#s52
you look at the schools like that where you 've got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to- well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh

#s53
and and they 're not all that way

#s54
but you know some that are um that they 're they 're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools

#s59
Yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s64
well you know in a lot of cases like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it 's it 's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education

#s65
It shows I think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know

#s66
and that may be passed on down to the kid as well

#s67
and uh maybe they pick up on that

#s69
And then from the other aspect um maybe the uh school itself has has has more emphasis on uh trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh

#s70
they may be able to to give the resources that 's needed to uh to do a good job

#s74
Uh that 's a tough question how to fix the school system

#s76
Uh with uh

#s77
I would try to I guess to see about getting parents more involved try to to come up with more ways to do that Uh uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and uh more more classes that I think that are

#s78
and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of um morals trying to teach the kinds of things that that are n't getting taught at home and uh and and respect for other people

#s79
Uh I think that 's a big part of it

#s80
You know people you know

#s81
if you do n't care about property and people you know you 're not going to care about uh about learning I think You know

#s83
you 're not going to really care about yourself

#s89
Right

#s95
Well you know and I

#s96
that 's not an ea- but that 's not an easy task you know

#s97
that 's why I say it 's it 's a tough question what would you do

#s98
because you know even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when uh when when you 're growing up in you know in a home which may be uh just the pits

#s99
and uh you do n't have any any kind of a good environment to live in you know

#s100
it 's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of other people 's stuff as well when you 're when you barely have anything yourself

#s101
So

#s103
I could see where that would be a problem

#s104
and I think that 's I think it 's
