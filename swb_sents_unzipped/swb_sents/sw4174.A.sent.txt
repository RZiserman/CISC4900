#s14
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Damn it I agree with pretty much with everything you 've said

#s18
Uh the one the one thing that I you know I 'd advise any parent uh you know or any or any person looking for a college uh is that I think I think you know it 's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there

#s19
because you know they 're just uh in my experience

#s20
I 've talked to people at other colleges uh that you know

#s21
the the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the cat- catalogs is n't always the whole story

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s29
Uh-huh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
Yeah

#s42
I I go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school

#s44
and uh you know I think I really do miss the fact you know that it 's not a university that there 's there 's not the the you know

#s45
it tends to be a very conservative school

#s46
and there and there does n't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have

#s51
Uh-huh

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
Yeah

#s61
Uh-huh

#s63
Uh-huh

#s66
Yeah

#s67
uh I do n't really know of anyone that 's like look- that 's looking for colleges now you know because it with the exception of uh people 's younger brothers and sisters

#s68
Then the only advise passed down is do n't go to Georgia Tech

#s69
Uh but uh no

#s70
actua- actually I 'm I 'm I 'm more interested in in in choosing the right j- job when you graduate type information

#s73
