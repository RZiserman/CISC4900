Taxes

#s5
Right

#s6
Right

#s7
Um

#s9
What do you do

#s11
I guess that

#s12
I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you 're in

#s15
Uh-huh

#s18
Right

#s20
Oh sure

#s23
Uh-huh

Right

#s33
Uh well no

#s34
I ca n't really complain

#s35
I 'm a student um

#s36
and I I work as a co-op at uh Georgia Tech Research Institute

#s37
And uh I 'm going to get back most of what I earned I mean most of what I pay in taxes

#s38
and uh and uh on- one of my parents is still claiming me

#s40
Huh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s42
I 'm sure

#s49
I went

#s50
well I did work um just very MUMBLEx for some time

#s51
but I did n't make enough money to really make too much of a difference

#s53
Right

#s56
No

#s57
no

#s58
I have n't

#s60
Uh-huh

#s65

#s102

#s103
Uh I uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition

#s104

#s106
Physics

#s108
Uh-huh

#s110
Everybody says that

#s112
Huh

#s116
Um I have n't I have n't gotten too terribly much into my major yet

#s117
Actually um the the degree I 'm getting is physics

#s118
There 's a different one for applied physics

#s119
so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied

#s122
I doubt about that

#s123
Are are is America I mean are we pretty pretty steep compared to most countries

#s125
