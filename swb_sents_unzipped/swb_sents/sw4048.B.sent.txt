#s1
pretty good

#s2
pretty good

#s3
So we 're talking about drug testing in the work place huh

#s8
Yeah

#s9
we have random drug testing at in my business

#s10
but I 've never been uh never had to do it

#s12
Yeah

#s13
yeah

#s14
they started that about a year ago

#s15
and I think it 's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff

#s17
But uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time

#s18
at least that 's

#s20
Pardon

#s22
Yeah

#s23
yeah

#s24
they they they 'll check for alcohol

#s26
No

#s27
once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you 're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing

#s29
Yeah

#s30
it 's a

#s32
I 'm in the oil business

#s34
Yeah

#s37
Yeah

#s38
I work in the office

#s39
so uh it 's pretty pretty safe environment

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
uh-huh

#s46
Well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on

#s53
Yeah

#s54
yeah

#s55
well I I I agree

#s56
I think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you 're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff

#s58
You know

#s59
if it 's

#s60
as long as it 's not abused uh you know random you know

#s61
as long as it 's random and and the individual 's rights are uh are protected I do n't have that big a problem with it

#s64
Well see this is

#s65
this is where I start having my problems with my company

#s66
I work for a private company

#s67
and and the policy is something like see if I can re- state this correctly now If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you 're eligible for company counseling

#s70
But if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired

#s72
So it you know it 's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos

#s77
Yeah

#s78
really

#s79
it 's one of those things that you read once

#s80
and then if you if you 're not worried about it you just forget about it

#s84
Yeah

#s85
Yeah

#s86
yeah

#s87
our company 's a little tougher on the second chance

#s88
I mean if if they 're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way I think a little bit more to uh to help you get help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job

#s90
But uh when you 're not when you 're a private company the rules do n't always apply

#s92
Well it 's it 's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment

#s93
and you know it 's not

#s94
I guess I ha- have n't run into anybody that 's that 's had a problem that 's that 's been a problem

#s96
Uh so I gue- you know I guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery

#s97
I mean everybody 's got an equal chance to get picked

#s99
So uh I 'd rather have that than you know say well this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in

#s100
and next week C -s and D -s are going to come in

#s102
Yeah

#s103
right

#s104
right

#s108
Yeah

#s109
especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff

#s111
You know I 've I 've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case

#s115
Uh I do n't remember to tell you the truth

#s116
I do n't think they do

#s117
Um well they must

#s118
I mean gee whiz

#s119
That just shows you how much I 've been paying attention

#s120
because I I really do n't know

#s121
I 'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask

#s123
Well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far

#s124
Uh there was a company in Houston that

#s125
they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company

#s127
oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of

#s128
it was not only drugs
