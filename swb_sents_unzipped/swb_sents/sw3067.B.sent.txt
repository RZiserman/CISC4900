#s1
Okay

#s2
uh

#s5
Uh yeah

#s6
uh our

#s7
the

#s8
my mother 's side of the family is quite large or well was quite large at one time

#s9
and uh they uh for as long as I can remember have had uh a yearly reunion

#s10
um back uh early on they used to to rotate them from hou- from som- to to different people 's houses in the family

#s12
And

#s15
Uh no no not no

#s16
this was well

#s17
I am actually from Mississippi

#s18
and so that 's

#s20
it it was around there generally

#s23
Uh that 's where the family grew

#s25
Yeah

#s26
and it was not only in Mississippi in some other places as well

#s29
so It was uh it was a big deal

#s30
but uh they tried to to centralize it in one spot

#s31
So in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year

#s34
We rent a pavilion and and do that

#s35
and that 's usually works out to be pretty good

#s36
And uh they will rent a pavilion on a weekend

#s37
and uh

#s39
I have not gone back lately

#s40
In fact uh this past Sunday was the was the reunion

#s41
but I did not get to go

#s42
Uh I have

#s45
Not getting to go

#s47
Uh just uh the distance involved

#s48
and

#s51
uh just not

#s52
I have a younger daughter now

#s53
and uh I

#s54
it 's kind of hard to get her get her there and everything

#s56
But I am going to to uh hopefully next year get to go back cause uh a lot of the family has not uh on her side my mother 's side has not seen you know my daughter

#s57
so

#s60
I have one brother

#s61
so

#s65
Yes

#s68
Right

#s69
yeah

#s71
Right

#s72
I I usually see her a couple times a year

#s73
so that 's no no big thing

#s74
But uh I uh I do I do enjoy the reunions

#s75
The only problem is that now uh

#s76
originally when we had them uh they were mainly my mother 's

#s79
uh father 's

#s80
My mother 's father 's family had quite a few uh brothers and sisters

#s82
So it was a large reunion of of of that group uh from that descendants

#s84
And uh a lot of those people have

#s85
and at time you know they all knew one another

#s88
And now it has gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are d- have uh have died off

#s89
or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group

#s92
And so uh it 's not quite as close as it used to be

#s93
So I think people feel less of a desire to really go

#s94
I know that

#s96
Well I I just think that uh you know at that ti-

#s97
when when they were a-

#s98
you know those were all brothers and sisters a lot

#s99
and or they were all in the same ar- geographical location

#s103
You know back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up uh you know they were all located together in one small community

#s107
And as as time grew I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth

#s108
And now when they come together it 's it 's generally you know

#s109
like say the kids of those people who are not you know anywhere near one another

#s110
and I do not think they feel the the closeness that they used to be there Which is a shame

#s112
but that 's just how it is

#s113
My mother was complaining last year about th- you know

#s114
it 's dwindling down every year

#s115
you know that 's just I think that 's just

#s119
Well yeah

#s120
Yeah

#s121
that 's uh

#s122
yeah

#s123
I think that 's some of it

#s124
But you know I

#s125
uh I I

#s126
it 's just the way you know I think society is now is that we are not we do not have the extensive family we used to

#s128
It 's more of a you know a smaller smaller unit

#s129
and you know we we tend to try to do things I think with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family Of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well

#s132
Uh

#s134
Right

#s135
it requires a lot of effort to to to do that sort of thing

#s138
I mean I I used to enjoy going

#s139
I mean I still do kind of enjoy it

#s140
but uh it 's it does not it 's not as many people there that I really really enjoy seeing

#s143
You know I

#s144
it 's going just for the sake of getting together

#s145
I think for the family

#s146
And

#s149
Uh

#s150
Um um no

#s151
not really

#s152
Tha- in that

#s153
but then again uh well I you know I have some aunts that uh I I I do

#s154
That 's about

#s155
my mother 's sisters you know

#s158
but I feel closer to them because I kind of grew up with them

#s159
But But uh as you know for the rest of that group no

#s160
not really

#s162
Uh you know and and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion

#s163
so uh

#s166
you do not really feel that that really close to them

#s170
Uh-huh

#s173
Uh-huh

#s180
That 's a good idea

#s182
Right

#s184
Yeah

#s185
Right

#s193
Yeah

#s195
Uh-huh
