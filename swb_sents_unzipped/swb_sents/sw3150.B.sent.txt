#s1
So how do you feel about capital punishment

#s4
Really

#s7
Oh I 'm pretty much for it

#s10
We 'll have some interesting discussion I guess

#s14
Wrongfully

#s15
Yeah

#s17
Yeah

#s24
Yeah

#s25
it would never be equal

#s26
Right

#s27
Right

#s28
Yeah

#s30
Well I guess you know I I guess I can see it from several different perspectives

#s31
but you know when I hear about things like you know what they 've what they 've been reporting about in Milwaukee you know I I to me I do n't see any way of rehabilitating the guy

#s32
You know maybe there is

#s33
I do n't know

#s36
But you know and you know he 's never going to be to me a functioning part of society

#s37
He 's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation

#s39
I mean I do n't know

#s40
I just I really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko

#s41
And you know for the things he 's done

#s42
I do n't know

#s43
I guess it 's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life you know or or capital punishment I guess You know

#s46
an- and-

#s47
Uh-huh

#s48
Oh really

#s50
Uh-huh

#s55
Right

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Well I can underst-

#s59
I I mean you know there there is always that chance

#s60
but you know I guess to some people it 'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever

#s61
I do n't I mean I do n't know

#s62
but uh you know but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gon na be you know

#s63
you you you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they wo n't do that you know for any for any situation really

#s64
But uh you know when I you find somebody just like that situation

#s65
I mean it was disgusting when I read about it today

#s66
And and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven I I 'd you know I guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him

#s68
and you know

#s69
Right

#s73
Right

#s74
Right

#s75
And trying to rehabilitate him too

#s76
and you know

#s78
Right

#s79
exactly

#s80
And uh you know nobody wants that

#s82
You know everybody would be just as scared to death you know

#s83
We we 've had a real problem here in Texas with uh prison overcrowding

#s84
and they 've been releasing people left and right

#s85
and you know they 've committed murders and rapes and everything else

#s86
and you know you just think you know where 's the justice here

#s88
I mean you know they 're not even having to serve out what they should be serving

#s94
Oh really

#s98
Uh-huh

#s99
Yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s107
Right

#s108
exactly

#s109
Yeah

#s110
Well you know that 's exactly

#s111
I mean I 'm I 'm not saying I I think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just do n't know

#s112
and I I think there 's a a shadow of a doubt you know like with this this guy in in Milwaukee

#s113
I mean it

#s114
he pretty much confessed to it

#s115
I mean they you know

#s116
just everything I mean cannibalism and everything else uh

#s118
I really would have a hard time especially if I was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed

#s119
Yeah

#s121
Because I mean that 's just awful

#s123
Right

#s124
Well I have a hun- I have a hunch that you know the other prisoners are n't going to be too happy with him anyway

#s125
Either I mean you know they

#s126
I do n't know

#s127
from from what I hear about jail life is not any way to live

#s129
But uh I do n't know

#s130
It 's just

#s133
Uh-huh

#s139
Really

#s144
Yeah

#s145
Yeah

#s148
Yeah

#s149
That

#s150
Yeah

#s151
Well you know especially like repeat offenders

#s152
It it just appalls me that they can be out you know they even get a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years

#s153
You know that 's that 's scary because you know I 'm not sure I think we 're paroling them without even knowing if they 're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not

#s156
Right

#s157
And it it 's it 's really scary

#s158
I me- you know

#s159
I I do n't know what the perfect solution to that is

#s160
but I know that especially with violent crimes where you know you 're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they 're guilty and without much repentance or anything else you know then I do n't know I I guess I I just really do n't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee you know

#s161
For instance I mean that 's just

#s162
I could see capital punishment in a case like that And you know for for other people too that do things like that

#s163
But uh when

#s164
uh my wife and I are both participating in this survey

#s165
and she picked up the phone

#s166
and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment

#s167
so she was uh

#s169
Yeah

#s170
well luckily it was for me Because they want th- they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other

#s172
So she tried to enter her number

#s173
and it would n't work

#s174
so she said whew it 's for you

#s175
So but uh you know I do n't know

#s176
I I struggle with it

#s177
but I I really think that in in terms of like this I 'd I think that it it might not be such a bad thing Because I do n't know that anybody w- in- I do n't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community

#s178
You know I I I 'm su-

#s179
you 'd have to be scared to death
