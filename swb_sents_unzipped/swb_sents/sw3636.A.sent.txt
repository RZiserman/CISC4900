Well so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping

#s22
This summer we went to uh the Smokey Mountain National Park And uh stayed about three or four days in there

#s24
It was wonderful

#s26
Nights were cool enough to where they 're comfortable

#s28
And the days were nice and warm

#s29
and it was beautiful beautiful few days

#s32
It worked out particularly well especially considering she was what six months pregnant

#s34
So I do n't know

#s35
it worked pretty well

#s36
It was one of those uh those dome type pop up tents

#s39
Nice and quick and easy to put up

#s41
Packs away nice and small

#s42
and about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto

#s45
It was a lot of fun

#s47
Oh yeah

#s49
Wow

#s50
that 's got to be beautiful territory

#s57
Yeah

#s58
What

#s59
like Sequoia National Park

#s61
Uh

#s66
Yeah

#s69
Yeah

#s71
Do they still have the uh the scenic uh roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees

#s78
Okay

#s82
No

#s83
so far New Orleans is far west as I 've gotten Well New Orleans and uh Minneapolis

#s87
Oh yeah

#s89
We 're hoping one of these days soon after we 're out of school to head that way

#s93
Oh yeah

#s94
Yeah

#s96
They seem to be trailing out quickly

#s101
Yes

#s105
I imagine

#s107
I would imagine they are

#s109
Yeah

#s113
Uh not a whole lot of forestry down there is there

#s116
Oh

#s118
Place is forested with c- with those concrete trees

#s121
Yeah

#s122

#s123
Anyway Uh what do you figure has been the longest trip you 've taken camping

#s127
Three weeks

#s129
Yeah

#s130
