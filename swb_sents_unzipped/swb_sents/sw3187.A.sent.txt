How would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home

#s5
Uh-huh

#s10
Right

#s11
And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him

#s14
Oh my

#s22
Yeah

#s23
so the convenience

#s24
Right

#s26
My grandmother lived with us um until August um

#s27
and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home

#s28
She has leukemia

#s30
and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away

#s32
so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home

#s33
and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility

#s34
She had her own little room and did n't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set

#s36
so

#s39
Yes

#s40
And that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two

#s41
so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room

#s43
so she did n't have to be transported back and forth

#s44
So she 's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well

#s45
It 's not her favorite place to be in

#s46
She 'd much rather be here with me

#s47
But when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her

#s49
and I 've got little children here who needed me here

#s52
she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day

#s55
So

#s56
She was falling down and hemorrhaging

#s57
and you know all kinds of physical problems

#s58
so it just became too much for me to handle

#s59
even though I would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she could n't anymore

#s64
Yeah

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
Yeah

#s68
Oh

#s71
Yeah

#s73
Yes

#s74
well I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions

#s75
It sure would n't have been Granny 's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home

#s76
but she 's accepted it real well now

#s78
so

#s80
Well we enjoyed having her here

#s82
but we feel she 's much safer where she is now

#s83
She still continues to fall

#s84
but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her

#s86
and I know she 's eating the right things

#s87
and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her

#s88
so It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair

#s90
so I think she 'll adjust
