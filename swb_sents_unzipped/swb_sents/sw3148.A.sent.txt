#s3
Where do you live

#s5
In Plano

#s8
In Dallas

#s10
Uh the air pollution is n't too bad in our area

#s11
So we 're very fortunate

#s12
but I know in some areas it 's really it it really is bad

#s21
I have n't either

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Well I think it would be terrible to live in an area like that

#s25
and unfortunately I think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad

#s27
Particularly in the areas where there are industries uh where they are burning a lot of coal and oil up more up north I guess uh

#s30
I think it 's a bigger problem With the car pollution anti-pollution devices

#s31
I think uh air is n't as bad it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area

#s42
From acid rain

#s45
I think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid

#s48
It just makes the rain fall on the acid side

#s49
and after a period of time I think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces

#s50
like you 've seen what it 's done to buildings even where it 's really bad

#s53
What 's interesting several years ago I took a course uh on uh

#s54
well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was and there was n't from various kinds of of energy

#s55
And uh at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain

#s56
and it was kind of pooh-poohed you know

#s57
Oh you 're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing

#s58
And it 's turned out that that 's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage

#s59
So it 's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course

#s60
Now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear

#s61
Uh I 'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use is not bomb quality

#s62
and we 're so strict with all our controls in the United States The chances of of an accident are slight

#s63
and it does n't pollute the air at all

#s64
It 's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant

#s65
Many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants

#s66
It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear

#s68
So I do n't know

#s69
In Europe there 's a lot of dependency on nuclear power

#s70
and they recycle the fuel

#s71
and then instead of of

#s72
some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid it could become uh bomb quality

#s73
But that 's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground As far as I 'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there 's some problem uh pollute the groundwater

#s74
So I do n't know what the answer is

#s75
The best answer of course would be solar or uh fusion or something clean

#s77
Well we 've got a problem on the line do n't we

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
But uh solar of course would be the clean the cleanest

#s87
I ca n't hear you at all for all this static

#s92
Now I can again

#s97
Uh-huh

#s98
Uh-huh

#s108
Oh yeah

#s109
It it 's still got a long way to go

#s111
It 's just you know a possible solution in the future I think maybe to help in some ways

#s113
It may not in all ways

#s114
Maybe they 'll come up with fusion You know con- be able to control it

#s115
I do n't know how long that 'll take

#s116
but one of these days

#s117
because that 's perfectly clean

#s119
It 's just we ca n't control it

#s120
Right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out

#s121
so it is n't

#s122
not at all

#s123
and you ca n't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field

#s124
so that 's not going to work

#s125
At least not now

#s126
But uh who knows what the future will hold Uh as far as energy goes

#s127
I I think with solving some of the energy future energy problems we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well

#s129
I do to

#s130
I like to be optimistic

#s131
I do n't like to be pessimistic about these things

#s134
We have one earth to live on

#s136
and we got to take care of it

#s140
Uh-huh

#s141
I 've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth

#s143
And so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we 'll solve a lot of our problems

#s144
I 'm afraid

#s145
I know I was part of the me generation where they did n't MUMBLEx so many of them did n't people did n't care

#s146
You know it 's whatever you know

#s147
recycle

#s148
well if it 's a problem forget that

#s149
Uh not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away

#s150
How horrible you know

#s151
Now I 've always done those kinds of things because I just did n't like messes

#s152
and
