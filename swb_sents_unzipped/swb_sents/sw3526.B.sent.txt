Or

#s11
My my

#s12

#s14
Uh I 've got an Omega

#s15
and I 've got a uh generic three eighty or four eighty-six machine

#s17
Yeah

#s18
it 's very very generic

#s21
Yeah

#s22
and and uh upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled

#s23
and now now it 's now it 's a fast machine

#s26
That 's all I got to say for it

#s29
Huh

#s31
Uh work

#s32
uh I 'm a contract programmer

#s35
Uh anything

#s39
Uh I 've done business programming scien- you know scientific applications like you know petroleum science stuff and Uh uh test equipment

#s40
and I did the I I did one that was the demonstration of a touch touch screen for a company that sells uh touch screens

#s41
It was kind of fun

#s43
Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display And make it look like things like uh you know attack simulators and MUMBLEx and all sorts of little things you 'd want to put your finger on the screen for

#s48
Oh yeah

#s49
definitely

#s51
Uh yeah

#s52
unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty eighty-six

#s53
It 's like slow

#s56
Huh

#s58
Uh-huh

#s61
Uh-huh

#s63
I know a guy that upgrades uh for a reasonable cost

#s65
Uh his name is T Q or something like that

#s66
And my notebook is somewhere around here

#s67
See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough

#s69
Uh he 's uh up in

#s70
Huh

#s73
Uh-huh

#s75
Oh that works

#s77
Uh here it is

#s78
A T S Computers

#s80
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh do you know where uh Custer is

#s84
Okay

#s85
he 's uh uh south of Renner on on Custer

#s87
And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like or strip kind of center

#s89
Huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s95
Right

#s96
it 's it 's it 's just south of there

#s98
It 's a little place looks like a castle

#s100
Kind of uh little guy in there

#s101
He he uh gives reasonable prices

#s103
Like I I traded my uh three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred

#s106
Yeah

#s107
it was pretty reasonable

#s109
But uh uh he

#s110
and he does a good job

#s111
and he s- he he uh guarantees everything he sells

#s114
Uh-huh

#s115
yeah

#s118
Uh-huh

#s122
Uh they they 're up there in that mall Uh just below Campbell Or that strip strip center

#s125
They 're still doing business Big business apparently

#s127
Uh-huh

#s128
oh yeah

#s129
I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in

#s130
you know it 's like wow

#s132
That works

#s133
I 'll go do that

#s135
And boy that thing screams now

#s139
Uh-huh

#s140
Well I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the the price difference is about ten dollars

#s143
Yeah

#s144
it when it comes on the manufacturing floor it 's about ten bucks

#s146
Yeah
