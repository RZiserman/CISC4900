Okay

#s2
When they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank

#s3
I thought Gee I have n't taken anything back for a long time

#s6
Yeah

#s8
Yeah

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Right

#s17
Uh-huh

#s24
Of course

#s25
uh-huh

#s27
Right

#s29
right

#s30
just to get you by five years

#s31
and then you 'll throw it away rather than have it fixed

#s33
We 're we 're a wasteful society for sure

#s36
Right

#s37
Right

#s38
And you usually get what you pay for

#s39
We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas

#s40
and they were like ten dollars

#s41
and we expected them to work nice for the little kids

#s42
and they did n't work worth anything

#s44
So we took those back

#s45
and that 's about that

#s46
all that were taken back in ages

#s49
Yeah

#s52
Right

#s55
Right

#s57
Oh really

#s58
It 's hard

#s63
Oh wow

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70
and it just pertained to that

#s75
I at first I thought of food you know because that 's what mainly what I buy it seems like

#s76
and uh you know I still do n't have any anything to do there

#s77
but But I I think too a lot of people do n't buy their warranties either because they know that when it 's that old they 're going to buy a new one

#s79
so

#s82
Yeah

#s83
my husband is really good at fixing things too

#s84
so he usually be able to fix anything that 's minor

#s85
and and that has saved us thousands of dollars you know from MUMBLEx to mechanic to anything like that

#s89
but but it was interesting to

#s90
I do n't know if they 're making them better or not

#s91
I it 's hard to say

#s92
Some I think they more of their parts plastic which you know makes things break easier

#s93
but I think the technology is better

#s97
About quality

#s99
Right

#s103
Yeah

#s104
Yeah

#s106
Right

#s107
Well people are n't willing to pay those prices very often so you know for a handcrafted something

#s108
so

#s111
so

#s112
So if we get what we what we deserve
