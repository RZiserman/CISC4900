#s5
No

#s6
I I never keep a budget

#s7
My budget or philosophy I guess is spend as little as possible

#s9
And uh and it 's it 's sor- sort of always worked

#s12
Uh but that depends you know on the individual if they can I guess have self-control

#s21
Uh-huh

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s32
Yes

#s35
Well yeah

#s36
I I could n't probably be bothered doing that every month

#s38
and and ever since

#s41
uh well we 've been married almost thirty years now

#s42
but uh my husband got paid once a month

#s45
So you learn to get

#s47
Right

#s48
You learn to get through you know to the end of the month

#s49
and uh

#s53
No

#s55
No

#s56
Because if you charge things uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid

#s58
or you get paid the last day or next to the last day

#s60
You pay all your bills

#s61
and there is n't anything left to spend anyway

#s64
Uh-huh

#s66
Well yeah

#s67
we we tried to to to

#s69
or we are paying them off now

#s72
Uh there was a time when maybe we did n't take all of them off

#s74
but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is

#s78
And for most of uh

#s79
I mean I 'm a substitute teacher

#s80
and I 've only substituted I guess for the last fifteen years

#s82
so there 's only been really one working

#s86
And uh it it works for me

#s87
but I ca n't see that it would work for probably the majority of people

#s92
Yeah

#s96
Uh-huh

#s97
Yeah

#s99
Uh-huh

#s100
It it is when you do it that way

#s106
Well we we eat out a good deal at this point

#s108
I I started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because I knew that you could n't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever

#s113
We were going to go for ten weeks uh in nineteen eighty

#s115
so I started working in nineteen eighty-seven and just saved for three years

#s118
But the

#s119
what minuscule amount I made

#s120
but that way you just did n't put it on your credit card

#s123
and and it was paid for

#s126
Yes

#s128
And so I think that that 's difficult for most people

#s129
but then my father was very Scotch

#s131
and you know you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to

#s132
Um

#s134
Yes

#s139
And I never worried about saving money because we just we 're in the savings plan at work

#s140
and they took it out

#s141
so

#s144
I uh

#s146
Uh-huh

#s148
Well we never had too much of that

#s150
but then we never had any really emergencies that uh

#s153
And we did n't buy really new or expensive cars

#s154
I think the most my we 're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars

#s156
And they were mainly used cars

#s159
Yeah

#s160
so

#s162
you know we 've been rather rather frugal in that In that respect

#s166
So

#s170
Well each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh
