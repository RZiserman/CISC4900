#s1
Yeah

#s2
I guess uh uh it 's an easy one for me

#s3
I think that 's uh there 's something seriously wrong

#s4
yeah

#s6
Uh I guess uh I think they 've lost their compass

#s7
and uh I 'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore

#s8
But uh I voted with my feet

#s9
and uh my kids go to parochial school

#s11
So uh

#s13
Well one hundred percent of the uh customers care

#s14
That 's one thing

#s15
Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting

#s16
And uh they uh take an active relatively active part

#s17
Which uh I mean if you 're uh sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on

#s18
and you uh uh pay attention and participate

#s19
and and you can influence the way things are

#s22
Yeah

#s23
The immediacy just is n't there

#s25
And uh uh I also think that one of the problems

#s26
and actually I do n't think this I think this is a cultural problem

#s27
The uh problem with public education is really uh really a problem with the culture

#s28
And I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school

#s29
and you ca n't get a tax levy passed

#s30
Uh people are uh reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it 's uh they do n't have kids in the schools

#s32
I think that 's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of uh uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it was n't our kids

#s33
I think that 's uh that 's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it as uh as their problem

#s34
and there 's an immediate problem

#s38
Right

#s39
Yeah

#s42
Yeah

#s43
You know I I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution Uh you know it barely made it

#s44
I think it was added afterwards

#s45
I think the real the principal was uh education for civic participation

#s47
The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter

#s48
and you could n't pull the wool over their eyes

#s52
Well that 's exactly what I was going to say

#s53
Now there seem to be really three reasons for education

#s54
One is education for civic duty

#s55
One is education for economic reasons

#s56
And one is education for civilization

#s57
I mean and I think that one

#s61
That 's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor

#s62
and then I quit and got disabused of that notion

#s63
But uh the uh uh now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is uh an economic enterprise to train people for jobs

#s64
And uh I 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is

#s65
And I 'm really sad to say this

#s66
I never thought I would have

#s67
but I really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem

#s68
And uh that 's why I guess I 'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs

#s75
Right

#s76
That 's what
