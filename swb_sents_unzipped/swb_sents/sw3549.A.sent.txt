What are you guys having for Christmas

#s5
Oh you 're not

#s9
Yeah

#s12
Well funny you should mention that

#s13
I 'm a pig farmer

#s15
Yeah

#s17
Well now it 's kind of a hobby more than anything else

#s18
but we 're going to have uh wild boar

#s20
we uh we killed a boar the other day

#s21
it was you know mating with the sows

#s22
and you ca n't use the piglets you know

#s23
so

#s25
It 's about six months of no use

#s26
so we uh we shot him and cleaned him out and had him you know processed into ham

#s27
and uh we 're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because I I 've got one that 's got a a hernia

#s29
and rather than you know pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we 'll just cook him and eat him

#s31
Well no

#s32
hey I tell you what

#s33
preparing a little pig is is a snap

#s34
I 'm telling you

#s35
real easy easier than chicken

#s37
Yeah

#s38
you just uh

#s39
you kill him you know

#s40
you probably

#s41
most guys just shoot them in the head

#s42
they go you know

#s43
in a second they 're gone

#s45
and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water pull it out and there 's a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what I usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him

#s48
And after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there

#s49
and it 's the best eating you ever had

#s51
Yep

#s52
just like a pig

#s54
I mean you know uh it has a lot less fat

#s56
This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds

#s58
and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds

#s60
Well you know we took the skin and the head and the le- and the feet off

#s61
and that was about you know a hundred hundred pounds of just ham

#s63
Oh well we 're you know we 're not going to eat the whole thing

#s66
It would take a year

#s67
But uh you know we 're going to drive up to Kansas City see my wife 's folks

#s68
and uh she she

#s69
what 's what 's what 's your mother cooking for Christmas

#s70
yeah

#s71
well her mom 's doing brisket

#s74
Brisket

#s75
It 's a part of the cow that they used to throw away

#s77
It 's just tough as a boot

#s79
and uh you know they used to use it for leather I think

#s81
I mean

#s82
no

#s83
I was kidding

#s85
But uh it 's it 's a part of the loin you know the rib cage

#s86
and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs

#s87
so it 's really really a tough piece of meat

#s89
but it 's so tasty you ca n't stand it

#s91
So you just take it

#s92
and you marinate it for a couple of days

#s94
MUMBLEx

#s96
And then uh you just put it in the oven

#s97
takes about four hours to cook one

#s98
They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds

#s100
And uh we 're going to have that

#s102
Oh well we 'll have cranberries and hominy

#s103
and uh we we are we 're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here

#s105
We have oliv- olives black olives and cucumbers and uh tomatoes

#s106
we still have tomatoes

#s108
yeah

#s109
fresh tomatoes

#s111
Well it started to freeze up around here you know

#s112
there 's nothing between you and us but our barb wire

#s113
and half of that 's down

#s114
I mean it 's thirty degrees this morning

#s116
Yeah

#s118
But uh it 'll go up to fifty or sixty almost

#s121
Oh yeah

#s122
Well it 's desert you know

#s123
where where we are it 's it 's it 's uh the edge of the desert

#s124
I mean it 's part of the Great Plains

#s125
So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred hundred and ten

#s127
and at night it goes down to about sixty

#s129
Yeah

#s130
we get a fifty de- degree temperature swing in about four hours

#s132
So everything that lives around here is real tough

#s134
That 's trees you know

#s135
we got hundred year old trees that are you know twenty feet tall

#s137
That 's all the bigger they get

#s138
they you know they 're just hard as a rock
