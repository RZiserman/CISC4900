#s3
Uh I have a Ford pickup

#s4
and uh the family car is a uh a Dodge Caravan And uh because we have three kids and they 're under thirteen

#s6
so uh

#s8
they sort of fit our requirement

#s9
Yeah

#s10
I have a one of those uh pickups with the uh seat with a seat in the back

#s13
And so they just fit in there

#s14
When they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work

#s16
Right now I can right now I can throw them all in the back when we have room

#s17
and uh and since I do a lot of projects I throw things in the back

#s19
and I kind of like having a pickup truck

#s22
Actually I think of it as a as a car that 'll last

#s26
I like the way trucks are built

#s27
and I do n't care about comfort

#s28
So I 'm pretty happy

#s34
So I would n't hesitate to get another one

#s35
I I never buy new

#s36
so I would n't hesitate to get another used truck

#s39
And uh yeah

#s40
I do n't I do n't need to pay for the glitz

#s41
I 'll let somebody else uh have the showroom shine

#s43
MUMBLEx and I 'll pay for the rest of it

#s46
Right

#s47
And uh the van we 're sor-

#s48
we might go again on a on a van

#s49
We we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time

#s50
I 'm not sure

#s52
We have to we we 'll have to face it in a couple of years

#s53
but uh I I guess we had a small Toyota wagon

#s55
and we were real happy with that because uh my my second requirement after price is uh low maintenance

#s57
And uh th- it certainly had that

#s58
We did n't do much to it at all

#s60
So

#s65
Uh-huh

#s72
Uh-huh

#s77
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-oh

#s85
How

#s86
at how at how many miles

#s88
Huh

#s90
You did n't overheat it

#s94
Uh-huh

#s98
Huh

#s99
Well that was MUMBLEx

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
Yeah

#s109
I have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it 's not raining

#s110
and uh uh he 's a

#s111
it 's

#s112
he 's pretty conservative guy

#s113
I do n't think it 's much of a sport for him

#s114
I guess uh

#s117
I 'm sure he does

#s118
yeah

#s124
No

#s126
Yeah

#s127
Uh

#s128
Yeah

#s132
Right

#s133
MUMBLEx

#s138
If I only had some place that I could store the uh camper top I would have it off most of the time

#s140
I really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty

#s143
But uh they 're solid

#s144
Uh trucks are built uh I mean

#s146
They 're the only things Americans still know how to build

#s147
and uh

#s156
Yeah

#s158
Right

#s159
I kind of like mine

#s160
yeah

#s161
so mine 's a Ford

#s166
Oh I heard about that

#s167
yes

#s169
Yeah

#s171
That that 's a serious truck

#s175
Right

#s176
this uh

#s177
I I know a contractor who just got one of those

#s179
He 's pleased with it
