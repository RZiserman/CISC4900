Well I I just last Friday got off a capital murder case

#s4
Yeah

#s5
I was on the jury Uh

#s7
Yeah

#s8
Which is funny because I got called last night and the topic was uh something about juries

#s10
Yeah

#s11
so I am just hitting it right

#s12
Uh how do I feel about it

#s13
I I do n't know

#s14
Well I guess it is right in certain cases

#s15
Uh

#s17
Becau-

#s18
well the one I was just on I do n't

#s19
I was an alternate on the case

#s20
so I do n't know what was decided

#s22
They are probably still in deliberations on it

#s24
But uh what I found out

#s25
once once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed we met with the judge

#s26
the two alternates did

#s28
And uh he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy

#s29
and I remember hearing about it

#s30
It was about a year ago

#s31
Uh he was he was involved in another one another capital murder the very next month

#s32
and he was caught just

#s33
they they drove up

#s34
the police drove up just as he fired the g- gun and killed the guy

#s36
So he was caught

#s37
and uh it 's interesting because the county I live in

#s38
I 'm not in Dallas county

#s39
I 'm I 'm pretty far north of Dallas

#s41
Uh county I live in in the past ten years only had t- two capital murders

#s43
And last year there were six

#s44
and this guy is indicted on three of them

#s46
Yeah

#s47
so you have to wonder you know

#s51
Yeah

#s53
Yeah

#s54
although you know it 's not really revenge because it does n't mean anything to him

#s55
You know he he has no concept of what he has done

#s57
He just

#s58
well from what I can tell

#s59
I mean I did n't talk to the guy or anything

#s60
but I mean he does n't seem to have any regard for anythi- anybody 's life including his own

#s63
So it 's it 's kind of strange that you know

#s66
No

#s67
huh-uh

#s69
Yeah

#s70
Yeah

#s71
well it 's funny because when you know they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder

#s72
I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours

#s75
And I

#s76
the

#s77
I was the I think the ninety eighth person they 'd interviewed

#s79
But you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you 'd ever know beyond a doubt

#s80
and I said I ca n't imagine

#s81
I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah I guess I could convict him

#s82
but I ca n't imagine you ever making me that sure of something

#s84
But they really did

#s85
It was it was really amazing

#s88
Well that was a subsequent case that we did n't know about And those jurors do n't know about

#s90
But this particular case I mean they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that that the police had n't released

#s92
so no one else would have known

#s94
It was it was really pretty interesting

#s97
Educational

#s99
Well they ca n't they can I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he has n't been he has n't been found guilty of it

#s102
Right

#s105
Right

#s106
so you know it 's

#s107
although it 's not going to take much to prove that

#s110
So

#s112
Uh yeah

#s113
this guy is up for the death penalty

#s115
Uh and in Texas there is there is a couple of questions you have to ask uh in the punishment phase

#s116
Uh for example was the guy provoked

#s117
and was the response reasonable given the provocation

#s118
And there is a number of questions

#s119
and just depending on whether you say yes or no uh you you can give him capital punishment

#s120
and if you 're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment then you can look at mitigating circumstances

#s123
So there is a lot of outs

#s124
but the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison

#s127
Yeah

#s128
Right

#s129
and and to me I mean you take away a person 's freedom you 've taken away most of their life

#s132
Yeah

#s133
but

#s134
But then you have to look at reality

#s135
I mean I think you know normally they they may get out

#s136
so

#s138
But what is it worth

#s139
I do n't know

#s141
Personally I do n't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself

#s145
Yeah

#s146
so you said you 're from Mississippi

#s148
And do they have the death penalty there

#s153
Uh-huh

#s156
Uh-huh

#s159
Uh-huh

#s163
Uh-huh

#s165
Uh-huh

#s170
Um Yeah

#s176
Ooh

#s178
That 's right
