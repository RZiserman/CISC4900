#s1
Well tell me about your home

#s6
Uh-huh

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Yeah

#s16
Huh

#s18
It sounds nice

#s21
Oh yeah

#s25
Yeah

#s26
Well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know

#s29
And uh I 'm insulating myself from that problem

#s31
I 'm building my own house

#s33
And as I look out the window of my trailer I can envision all the insulation that 's going up today

#s35
Yeah

#s37
Yeah

#s39
I used to be a builder

#s41
And I retired about five years ago and started college

#s44
And now I 'm a college educated builder

#s45
There 's still no work you know

#s47
So uh you know I decided this summer that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials

#s48
so I did

#s50
And uh see the the the state has a law that says you can not borrow the money to build your own home

#s54
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house

#s55
but you ca n't borrow the money to build your own

#s57
Well it 's to protect the the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home

#s59
and then it does n't sell

#s60
and then the bank 's holding the bag

#s63
Well

#s65
As as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it 's supposed to costs three times as much

#s66
Right

#s68
Hence the savings and loan problem we have

#s71
But uh you know my home is uh fairly simple

#s72
It 's designed to be added on to

#s75
Yeah

#s76
Well I figure it 's just me and my wife

#s77
but you know I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot

#s78
so I want to have a shop

#s81
Ten acres

#s85
Well yeah

#s86
It 's really nice too because I ca n't see my nearest neighbor

#s87
He 's on the other side of a hill

#s89
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon

#s90
Seriously

#s93
Well in the winter time I can see see another guy

#s94
but you know he 's

#s96
I can just make out his place you know

#s97
I 've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north

#s100
And uh

#s102
Yeah

#s103
Well I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the the house has no heating or air conditioning

#s106
Well it 's got a a very small furnace

#s108
And a uh we 'll use a wood burning stove as well

#s110
But in the house itself I 've been working inside you know these lo- these many months

#s112
and I have not had to use the heat

#s114
Because it 's all geothermal

#s117
And with all the

#s118
see I 've got

#s119
on the south side is all glass

#s120
Well as much as I could get in it you know

#s121
And uh the east side is glass

#s123
I 've got one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet

#s124
So it 's almost all glass

#s126
And uh

#s128
Oh yeah

#s129
I mean you know There 's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows

#s132
So uh

#s134
Well not really

#s135
It 's uh it 's on the side of a hill

#s137
So the first you know

#s138
the the the what I call  residential level at the side that 's in the hill is about four feet deep

#s141
And the side that 's on the uh the other side is about six feet high

#s143
So I 've got a pretty good grade there

#s145
And then when I put the verandas whi- which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop

#s149
Exactly

#s155
Uh-huh

#s157
Uh-huh
