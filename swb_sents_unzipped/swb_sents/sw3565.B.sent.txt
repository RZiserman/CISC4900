Our most recent series of projects I guess was inside was uh we remodeled a bathroom recently

#s4
Well it went pretty well uh other than the fact that we encountered some uh problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing which one thing led to another

#s5
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain Which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over

#s8
It was n't one of those

#s9
it started out as a Sunday project

#s11
and by by the next Sunday it was done

#s12
It was n't a one dayer

#s13
Believe me

#s17
Yeah

#s18
it 's good for another thirty years

#s20
Yes

#s22
Well that 's the thing that surprised me because once I got into the plumbing everything in there was copper

#s24
and it was all soldered

#s26
That 's what drove me bananas because you know I 'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together

#s29
and nothing wanted to go

#s30
so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over

#s32
Really

#s34
That was an all day job just to get it plumbed

#s36
Fortunately I was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked

#s38
everything worked

#s39
And I just said that 's marvelous

#s40
I appreciate it

#s42
Well I expected something to leak you know

#s43
left a fitting loose or did n't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that

#s47
But it all came together

#s48
so I I felt pretty fortunate about that

#s50
How about you

#s52
Uh-huh

#s56
What kind of paint

#s59
Uh-huh

#s62


#
Yeah

#s64
that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls

#s68
Was it not washable paint

#s73
Uh-huh

#s76
What color is it

#s78
Pink

#s79
okay

#s84
Did you uh require more than one can of paint

#s88
You did n't have to mix paint then right

#s90
Okay

#s93
Uh-huh

#s94
Yeah

#s97
Yeah

#s98
But you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with

#s103
How 'd that go

#s106
Kind of fun is n't it

#s108
Really

#s111
Repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper

#s116
Yeah

#s118
Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats

#s121
Yeah

#s124
Um

#s126
When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall

#s129
Or did you start at the edge

#s133
Uh-huh

#s134
Uh-huh

#s136
I 've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall

#s137
and I 'll start with a plumb line And start in the middle of the wall and and go from there and go all the way around the room

#s142
Well you you
