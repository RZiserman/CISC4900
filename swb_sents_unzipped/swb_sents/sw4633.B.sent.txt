How many children do you have now

#s3
You have five

#s5
Well you do have a hard time finding time then do n't you

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
You sound so young

#s12
All right

#s13
To have them uh

#s15
I think you 're doing a good job

#s16
I just have one child

#s18
And uh I do n't think uh

#s19
well there 's not much I can do about it

#s20
My my wife and I are u- in our forties you know

#s21
so uh

#s23
but it 's hard to raise one child without them thinking they 're the they 're the pivot point of the universe

#s27
Yeah

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
I have a younger brother like that

#s33
I 'm in my forties like I say

#s34
and I have a brother in his twenties

#s36
And I was I was the youngest

#s38
So I understand how that worked

#s39
And he was treated like he had five fathers or something

#s44
Yeah

#s49
Did you all do a lot of organized things like uh Little League uh soccer

#s54
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s61
Yeah

#s65
You know I think that 's probably true

#s66
The

#s67
if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities

#s69
and if you have a large number of children or then you do n't

#s71
No

#s72
you ca-

#s73
and there 's not enough time uh

#s75
like my son is in uh Little League this year

#s76
He 's ten

#s77
And they practice three times a week

#s78
and they have a game

#s79
and it 's just uh

#s80
if there were more than one child I do n't know the- there would be no way to do it

#s83
You know one parent go one direction

#s84
and I 'd have to go in the other

#s85
and we could only cover two at that

#s91
Uh-huh

#s99
Uh-huh

#s103
I do n't think although i-

#s104
I think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me

#s105
but I 'm not sure I could afford three

#s106
I most certainly could n't educate three

#s107
I do n't know how my my parents did it

#s109
I mean there were five of us

#s110
and I do n't recall you know wanting anything in particular

#s111
Uh but I do n't know how my father did it

#s112
He worked at a truck line

#s113
and he just did n't make that kind of money with five children

#s114
But we did okay

#s115
We had a house and a home and

#s116
but now my wife and I both work

#s117
and we do n't I do n't believe we have as much as my parents did

#s118
and we only have one child

#s120
Uh-huh

#s123
Huh

#s125
Atlanta is horrible

#s127
Yes

#s128
Ha- we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and and different areas

#s129
and from talking to them they 're shocked

#s131
Wha-

#s132
and they you know

#s133
the housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it

#s136
They sell their house

#s137
they stash away a good bit of money and come down here

#s138
and I work with a lot of them

#s139
they they think they they have really done something

#s140
Then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to to where they came from

#s143
The housing is cheaper

#s144
but that 's about it
