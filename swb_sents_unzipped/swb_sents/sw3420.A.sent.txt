Hello

#s2
my name is Donna

#s3
and I 'm calling from Plano Texas

#s7
Oh okay

#s8
Um would you like me to go first

#s10
Okay um

#s11
I have three children um two two who are in regular school uh eleven year old an eight year old

#s12
and then my little one three year old is in um a University of Gymnastics

#s13
it 's a a preschool

#s15
and um I think it was really hard to um to pick the right uh day care or preschool or Mother 's Day Out

#s16
I guess you can classify them all together

#s18
Um some of the qualifications that I look for was that uh you know the cost and um exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic um uh in there and um you know um you know what the qualifications of the teachers ' were and if the place was clean and um the hours

#s20
and um just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff

#s24
Oh congratulations

#s27
Right

#s31
Or staying home

#s34
Uh-huh

#s37
That 's a very good place to start I think

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
Yeah

#s40
the Mother 's Day Out programs

#s41
and that 's where Shannon had started in a Mother 's Day Out program

#s43
and uh the churches always have I think a a pretty good program

#s44
and you have to make sure that you um that you apply pretty early because they do have a lot of places have very long waiting lists

#s46
And um and another question to ask is if they 're um state certified um you know if the teachers have um their Master 's degree in in child education and um child development

#s49
Um you know what what kind of a structure is it going to be

#s50
Um when your child 's a little bit older like a three year old you 'd be more concerned with if there 's a type of care that it 's torture for them to lay down and take a nap

#s52
Is there like a mandatory nap time

#s54
What they do at Shannon 's school is have a video tape going

#s55
and if and they lay on these little mats

#s56
and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep

#s57
and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones

#s58
and the other ones get up and go do something else

#s60
So she does n't have to necessary take a nap there you know which is which is nice Um

#s64
That 's true

#s67
Right

#s68
And sometimes when the child 's a lot younger before they 're really um before three years old you know like the church is a good program

#s69
and sometimes you even consider um you know having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little or or something like that

#s71
and another consideration is how many infants or children are they what 's the ratio of of teachers to to children

#s74
because that makes a a a difference

#s75
and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day

#s76
just your child

#s77
and or do they just put any child in any crib you know

#s79
you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know

#s82
I 'm sure that um whatever you decide you 'll be happy with

#s84
And it 's exciting time to have a new one

#s87
I bet

#s88
That 's that 's wonderful

#s92
Uh-huh

#s94
Asking

#s95
Right

#s96
Some some places um start them as early as I think well some some places take them as infants I guess you know like eight weeks even

#s98
Um there 's a place to look into um um

#s99
a friend of mine who 's a nurse is was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in on Fifteenth Street

#s100
up

#s101
it 's in Plano somewhere where um

#s102
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants infants and then only up to like two years old

#s104
and it 's it 's supposed to be really a a

#s105
you know some places just specialize in just real little ones

#s107
and then other ones uh are the older children

#s109
But it is a difficult situation I think

#s110
When they 're when they 're little it 's almost easier to leave them because when they 're three and they 're cry
