#s1
Okay

#s2
looks like we 're ready to go

#s3
Capital punishment uh

#s4
the problem I have with capital punishment is that uh uh it 's supposed to be a deterrent to crime

#s5
but I do n't think that it really actually does that

#s6
I do n't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are uh are committed with a without any thought to the consequences

#s7
and they do n't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe I should n't do this uh because uh I might get the gas chamber or something like that

#s8
They worry about it afterwards

#s9
and then they try and get out of it

#s10
And uh how about you

#s12
Uh-huh

#s13
I do too

#s14
yep

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
yeah

#s19
you still have to do it

#s20
I I

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
So you 're in you 're in favor of capital punishment then

#s26
Right

#s28
Uh-huh

#s29
Uh-huh

#s30
Needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society

#s32
Right

#s33
And then do it all over again

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Right

#s37
Have to agree with you

#s38
and I 'm kind of i- in favor of capital punishment also

#s39
I just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes

#s40
but I tend to agree with you that uh we should have it

#s41
I just I do n't know that it 's always effective

#s42
but I guess we uh we 're kind of stuck with it

#s43
It 's it 's a difficult uh problem is n't it to determine how you 're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh

#s45
Uh-huh

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Right

#s48
uh-huh

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
huh Do you think they should be punished at all or uh like go to prison uh

#s52
because they 're not really a danger to society

#s53
It was almost really self defense is n't it in a case like that

#s55
Uh-huh

#s58
I know they put uh put them in jail sometimes I guess

#s59
Uh

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Uh-huh

#s64
Um

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
You know now I wonder what you think about this

#s67
and uh unfortunately we we do n't get to do it

#s68
but uh it used to be a long time ago I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment

#s69
So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person

#s70
And I know that uh if somebody had done something to my family I would feel that I had the right to to get revenge on them

#s71
and uh but I I do n't think that 's done much anywhere

#s72
That 's kind of drastic punishment

#s74
Right

#s76
Might make you feel better

#s77
but

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
Right

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
Right

#s84
Uh-huh

#s85
Right

#s86
because they 're a danger to everybody else

#s87
Huh that 's interesting

#s88
I have to uh agree with that

#s90
There 's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that are n't really a danger to society huh

#s91
and uh

#s93
Right

#s94
Right

#s95
probably more of them then the other way around

#s96
Interesting

#s97
I do n't I do n't

#s98
not sure

#s99
I I 'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it

#s100
I 'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here

#s102
Uh-huh
