Good morning

#s5
Yes

#s6
we do

#s7
We 've got uh a pickup twice a week that they come out

#s9
and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody

#s10
and they take it

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s23
Oh

#s26
Um my kids do

#s29
Put it that way

#s30
They they 've been recycling cans for extra money

#s33
So that 's that 's been their summer money

#s34
and they 're fixing to go to Disneyland

#s35
So

#s37
So

#s39
Yeah

#s42
Uh-huh

#s48
Really

#s51
Is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they weigh it or whatever

#s52
and

#s55
Um

#s59
Yeah

#s64
Yeah

#s65
I was amazed at how many cans that we got MUMBLEx

#s68
because when the kids first went down I said that you know that 's great

#s69
and I was thinking you know maybe I 'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in

#s71
but it 's amazing how many cans you go through And how fast they accumulate

#s76
Uh-huh

#s81
Yeah

#s84
Really

#s87
Uh-huh

#s96
Yeah

#s97
MUMBLEx we do n't e- we do n't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard

#s98
So if it mows gets mowed I do it normally

#s100
And I ca n't mow the yard with the grass catch on it

#s101
It 's too heavy

#s103
So I just m- I just mow it and leave it

#s105
It just soaks in

#s111
Uh-huh

#s114
Yeah

#s117
Oh I like it better doing it

#s118
Well one

#s119
it cuts down on my mow time anyway

#s122
and you zip through it quicker

#s126
Proba- we probably will

#s129
Yeah

#s132
Uh-huh

#s136
Yeah

#s142
Really

#s144
What what makes me sick is is when they show the dump sites you know and and how big they are

#s147
Or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river

#s150
and they do n't have any place to put it

#s151
and it just floats in the MUMBLEx

#s152
it 's like ugh

#s157
No

#s165
Yeah

#s166
It it 's it 's convenient out here for them to do it

#s170
They pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper

#s172
Uh-huh

#s175
And they will do the alum-

#s177
No

#s178
you just put it in the one bin

#s179
and and I guess they do the sorting

#s180
But um they 'll do the aluminum cans too

#s181
but we do n't give them those

#s184
The kids keep those

#s185
So

#s188
Uh-huh

#s189
Well we do n't we do n't take the newspaper to begin with When neither one of us are home t- to read it

#s193
So we do n't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass

#s194
At first when it first started it it it was hard You know because you 're just used to throwing things

#s197
Uh

#s202
It is

#s207
Oh I know

#s208
Well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they 're oh no do n't do that

#s209
and they go to the sink

#s210
they rinse them out

#s211
and they put them upside down

#s212
they let them drain

#s213
and and then uh after a couple of days they take them all outside

#s215
and I put them in a big bag anyway

#s217
and then they dump the bag out

#s218
and then they crush them

#s219
So that 's their activity thing To go out there and crush

#s224
So

#s227
Yeah

#s234
Oh really
