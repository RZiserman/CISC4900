#s1
Okay

#s2
so now what are your opinions on recycling

#s6
Yeah

#s8
Yeah

#s9
I have heard that too

#s15
Uh-huh

#s19
Well see I started saving newspapers

#s20
and I would take a ton of them

#s22
and uh that 's

#s23
I ca n't remember where I went to take them

#s24
but they would n't take them

#s29
Oh I know

#s33
There is no really recycling facilities

#s36
I think that is a good idea

#s38
Besides well like a law or whatever

#s39
An- that 's how it is in New York is n't it

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
And you get ticketed if you do n't do it right

#s49
Yeah

#s52
Plus you have to have a place to store all of it

#s54
and see I live in an apartment

#s62
Uh-huh

#s64
Yeah

#s67
Uh so that way it kind of forces you to recycle

#s71
Yeah

#s72
that 's true

#s76
Yeah

#s77
I have seen them

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
That take them back

#s86
Is Texas one of them

#s89
Yeah

#s90
No

#s91
I do n't think that there is enough being done

#s92
Now I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters

#s94
And we have a paper recycling program that uh is company wide

#s95
and I do the recycling for that

#s97
Yeah

#s100
Yeah

#s101
And I know there is a lot of computer paper that you ca n't use

#s104
But uh we use to have uh

#s105
I mean I do n't even remember how much money that they 've uh I mean the money that they 've made from the recycling program

#s106
They have donated it to charities

#s108
I mean they have made a substantial amount of money from it

#s113
Yeah

#s117
Yeah

#s122
Well I know

#s123
you see some of the stuff

#s124
and then when they come out with the new things you are like well why did n't you think of that before

#s130
Yeah

#s131
that 's true

#s134
Yeah

#s139
Do they not ever I mean I do n't know that much Do they not ever burn trash or anything like

#s143
Then that 's pollution

#s147
Yeah

#s148
I know

#s149
I guess you run into the pollution factor

#s152
Yeah

#s154


#
It is really sad
