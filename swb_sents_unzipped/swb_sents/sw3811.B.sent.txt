#s2
Yeah

#s3
we

#s4
Two year old daughter in child care

#s5
and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh pretty reasonable price we think

#s8
How about you

#s9
do you have any children

#s13
Oh boy

#s15
Yeah

#s17
Are you

#s18
Where are a student

#s21
No kidding

#s23
I was a professor in a university here in California for a while

#s25
Yeah

#s26
uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a a year or two

#s29
Yeah

#s31
Uh-huh

#s33
Yeah

#s40
Yeah

#s41
Yeah

#s43
Well that 's a good experience I think

#s44
and uh there are a lot of things to think about

#s45
and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good

#s46
and they kind of boil down to uh

#s47
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative

#s49
and what we found uh to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving

#s51
and uh that 's more important than anything else

#s52
We could have sent uh her to a fancier uh facility

#s54
Uh she goes to a home

#s55
This is a uh a couple uh emigrated from China early in in their lives

#s57
They 've been here probably thirty forty years

#s59
They 've got three daughters

#s60
Uh and they have a loving home

#s61
and uh they 're both there

#s62
and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon

#s64
And our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends

#s66
so it 's a good experience

#s68
I th- if it 's good I think it 's very good for the child

#s70
And if it 's a loving environment I think it 's very good

#s71
and and that 's really what we 've learned about it

#s72
She 'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year

#s74
but uh we feel real fortunate

#s75
and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace

#s76
I do n't know what it 's like around uh Hattiesburg

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
Yeah

#s82
Yeah

#s83
I 'll bet they 're involved

#s84
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s90
Well that 's uh

#s91
I know it 's it 's a real hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities

#s93
Out here at Manford they have a you know a a a real good facility

#s94
and there uh is quite a waiting list to get into that

#s96
So it 's uh uh you know it 's a it 's a it 's an important decision

#s97
it 's an industry that 's still a cottage industry

#s99
and I think this is b- really is buyer beware

#s103
Well it is the best way to do it interestingly

#s105
I think that uh my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn

#s109
Because I think what we 're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market

#s110
As a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because I believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care

#s112
Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life

#s115
It 's it 's phenomenal

#s117
It 's phenomenal the programming the human operating system
