#s1
Well I almost forgot the topic

#s2
I was waiting so long for uh for it to find somebody

#s3
Um

#s5
Right

#s6
well so what is your favorite T V show

#s8
Oh you like that one

#s12
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh I 've never really watched that one

#s14
You know it 's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows

#s17
and uh you know there 's so there 's only a few that I that I like to watch routinely

#s19
Probably my favorite is um oh

#s20
well I like shows like GROWING PAINS

#s21
and uh what 's the other one now

#s22
they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night

#s23
so I do n't get to watch it very much

#s25
WONDER YEARS

#s26
yeah

#s27
that 's my favorite

#s28
Uh

#s31
Yeah

#s32
WONDER YEARS

#s33
I I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever

#s34
I guess I can really relate to it

#s35
and uh it 's just a real cute show

#s36
Uh I I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of uh I do n't know honesty or sort of a purity value I guess

#s41
Uh-huh

#s42
Yeah

#s43
Right

#s44
right

#s47
Uh-huh

#s48
yeah

#s49
my wife really likes that show

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s58
Yeah

#s59
well there was

#s60
but there 's a sense of ho- I guess purity in the show

#s61
like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS

#s63
but uh you know Richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure I guess

#s65
and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it

#s67
and I never did like it after that

#s69
so I do n't know

#s70
I I say see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch

#s71
There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere

#s75
Yeah

#s76
uh-huh

#s80
Uh-huh

#s83
So you 're going to watch a game tonight

#s86
So do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything

#s89
Oh uh-huh

#s93
Yes

#s94
Yeah

#s95
he 's a nice guy

#s96
I take it you live in the Dallas area

#s98
Do you live in the Dallas area

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
yeah

#s102
I live in Garland

#s103
and yeah

#s104
I I like Steve Bushel

#s105
but I do n't really like the Pirates

#s106
I 'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan

#s108
so uh I 'm kind of I 'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all

#s109
they you know they they 've come from so far down

#s111
I really would like to see them do well

#s116
Yeah

#s117
one one year they

#s118
maybe they 'll make it

#s119
I do n't know

#s121
so but uh yeah

#s122
I like sports programming quite a bit

#s123
but uh I guess my my favorite shows are the

#s124
and you know that getting back to the point that you made that 's really true

#s125
we were watching ROSEANNE I guess couple of weeks ago

#s126
and her daughter was talking about birth control you know

#s128
and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time

#s129
and you know she 's only seven years old

#s130
so

#s134
Yeah

#s135
Yeah

#s138
Yeah

#s139
yeah

#s141
Yeah

#s142
well that that seems to be more our values too

#s143
like the WONDER YEARS I I mean it 's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers

#s144
you know or and you can kind of relate to it you know

#s146
I do n't know

#s147
that 's

#s148
I enjoy that a lot

#s151
but uh you know I agree with you

#s152
the

#s153
and it 's funny because the shows

#s154
like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like THREE 'S COMPANY and stuff I think they they maintained

#s155
people would watch them because there was that uh you know there was really the period that was going on there

#s156
I mean he really was n't messing around with the girls

#s157
but everybody perceived him that way and stuff

#s159
but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died

#s161
and it 's it 's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
