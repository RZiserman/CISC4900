#s1
Okay

#s3
What 's your view

#s5
What 's your view

#s7
Yeah

#s8
Yeah

#s9
that 's true

#s11
You know even if they give it a shot it 's still going to be black market all over the place you know

#s14
I do n't know

#s15
Coming from Texas you 're probably

#s16
I do n't know

#s17
I should n't make stereo types

#s18
but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think

#s24
Oh you 're just live down there

#s25
Yeah

#s28
Oh well

#s30
Yeah

#s31
well I know how you feel

#s32
I 'm uh I grew up in Nebraska

#s33
and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know

#s34
and man there 's no way There 's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons

#s36
That 's just

#s37
I do n't know

#s39
Yeah

#s41
It does n't sit with me very well

#s42
I do n't know I anymore

#s43
I keep a thirty-eight in my truck you know

#s45
Yeah

#s46
I just about all

#s47
well I live in Minneapolis

#s48
and I

#s49
well actually I live in Florida

#s50
but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year

#s51
and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now

#s54
and it 's just you never know who is out there

#s56
You know it 's just for self protection purposes

#s57
and then of course there 's the hunting issue

#s58
so

#s60
yeah

#s61
that 's good

#s62
What do you do Jeff

#s64
Oh yeah

#s66
All right

#s68
Yeah

#s70
I 'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here

#s72
So uh

#s73
yeah

#s74
You guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything

#s75
or

#s79
Yeah

#s80
You know that 's something I miss quite a bit

#s84
Yeah

#s86
Yeah

#s87
All right

#s88
Yeah

#s89
my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit

#s90
but I do n't know

#s91
I guess that what the scale now is it 's zero for uh for a complete

#s93
That 's right

#s94
I guess I am about eight or nine

#s97
Yeah

#s98
no doubt about it

#s99
but uh

#s101
Yeah

#s103
Yeah

#s104
if there 's if there 's a way you know to limited it to people that I do n't know

#s105
they I guess they passed a couple of uh uh laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun

#s107
and then they actually uh

#s108
I know it 's this way in Florida

#s109
They have a waiting period where you buy one

#s110
and that 's a week

#s112
and then they check you out and make sure you do n't have a record you know and things like that

#s113
I think that 's a pretty good idea

#s114
Uh and that 's

#s115
I do n't know

#s116
that 's not a bad idea

#s117
but then again you can always get around that

#s118
You could go through the black market like you say

#s119
You know you always be able to get around

#s120
but uh

#s122
Yeah

#s123
it 's one of things

#s124
but uh I do n't know

#s125
I guess I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled

#s126
just like I 'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon

#s129
Yeah

#s130
I 'm just not

#s131
I think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway

#s134


#
It kind of takes the sport out of hunting

#s140
You know it 's like what can you do with that that you ca n't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve

#s142
You know you might do the same thing

#s144
And so it 's like I do n't know It does

#s145
It takes the sport out of it

#s146
For me I would much rather have a bow anytime

#s148
I I like bows

#s149
You know I have done some bow hunting

#s150
and I uh I get into it

#s151
and I think it 's more of a challenge you know

#s153
But uh I do n't know

#s154
I guess it keeps the shell makers in business

#s156
But uh I do n't know

#s157
Anyway that 's about where I stand

#s159
You uh

#s162
And you uh have you eaten yet or whatever

#s164
Is it seven o'clock there

#s167
You guys central

#s169
Oh it 's not too good

#s170
It 's kind of rainy actually

#s172
Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh I do n't know ten or twenty degrees

#s174
and it 's been up around forty

#s175
So people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature

#s176
Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that

#s177
so

#s179
I am just up here for the year

#s180
and it 's kind of shocking

#
