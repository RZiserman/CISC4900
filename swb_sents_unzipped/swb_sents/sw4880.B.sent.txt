#s1
Okay

#s2
Well uh I 'll let you start I guess

#s8
Uh no

#s9
I mean I 'm not

#s10
my employer does not do that Uh although uh I had an ex-employer that

#s11
uh the previous job I used to have uh they

#s12
after I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test

#s14
Uh I I do n't know

#s15
My feeling is that certain jobs that when there 's immediate threat to life and limb uh if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I I 'd be willing to support that

#s16
For example uh uh well uh uh train engineers

#s18
Because it you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer MUMBLEx you know

#s20
he crashed and killed some people because he was uh smoking some marijuana

#s21
and I guess air traffic controllers I would n't want them to be on drugs And airplane pilots

#s22
But where it 's not necessary uh in that regard where it 's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh I I 'd I would seriously question it

#s24
Uh so

#s37
So it 's the government that 's mandating it to a certain extent

#s46
Yeah

#s47
Well i-

#s53
Huh

#s56
Right

#s57
And

#s62
Yeah

#s63
yeah

#s64
I agree

#s65
I mean it 's well there 's also the issue of uh

#s66
o- out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of

#s67
there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results

#s68
O- or I should n't say high

#s70
I mean several percent

#s76
Kind of a coarse kind of test

#s79
Is that done

#s80
Right

#s82
Now l- let me ask you this

#s83
Uh e- e- at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any

#s86
Okay

#s87
so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
