#s1
I do n't believe that we 're

#s3
The recycling program here is just terrible

#s4
I mean it 's hard to find places to go

#s5
I mean Kroger does a couple things

#s6
They I do n't think they do they do newspapers

#s14
Yeah

#s16
The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything

#s17
They pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff

#s19
They pick up everything

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s31
Yeah

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
I know it

#s36
I know it

#s38
It piles up

#s40
I just do n't know

#s41
I just do n't know

#s42
and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center

#s43
you ca n't really unload all your stuff

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
I know it

#s52
I know it

#s55
Oh yeah

#s58
The

#s60
Uh-huh

#s62
Well I mean it 's real

#s63
you ought to because the the the farmer 's market recycles absolutely everything

#s65
And since we go there all the time I mean

#s67
probably MUMBLEx at all

#s70
Oh by the way may name 's Julie

#s74
Hi

#s76
I 'm from Atlanta

#s78
Neat

#s81
I just think that everybody ought to do it

#s86
The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs

#s88
Yeah

#s90
Oh yeah

#s91
they have uh

#s92
uh what I what I used to uh

#s93
now that I do n't go to the grocery store much it 's kind of moot

#s94
but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over

#s97
A- but also most places like Big Star does

#s98
and I 'm not sure if Kroger does or not

#s99
but

#s101
Yeah

#s102
and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in

#s104
Can bring them in

#s106
I know it

#s107
I know it

#s109
It really is a small hostile planet

#s111
Did you know that

#s112
No

#s113
really not

#s114
Did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world 's landfills is like paper Filled with paper

#s117
Huh

#s119
Well it is it is though

#s122
It is because they

#s126
Well they do treat paper with chemicals

#s127
like yellow paper you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose

#s130
You know you can bury a piece of yellow paper

#s131
it will still be there in a couple of weeks

#s133
Yeah

#s135
it will be whole

#s136
You 'll be able to read off of it

#s138
Yeah um

#s141
W-

#s143
Well white paper 's bad too

#s144
They they treat it too

#s146
I 'm sure that 's fine

#s147
I 'm sure

#s148
Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again

#s150
Maybe

#s152
Yeah

#s154
You think

#s155
I do n't know

#s156
well I mean I think we 've kind of you know

#s158
I mean everybody everybody everybody has a computer

#s161
We would no longer need paper at all

#s164
I would love that
