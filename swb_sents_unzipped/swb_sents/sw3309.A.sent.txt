#s3
What 's your opinion

#s11
Okay

#s12
I I tend to agree with you

#s13
When it comes to government spending there are so many studies done that do n't mean anything

#s15
but we 'll spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on

#s17
And it 's nice to know something does n't work or something does n't exist

#s18
but it could be put to more practical use

#s21
That is true

#s22
I agree with you in that area

#s23
Uh I have a tendency to

#s24
I 'm in from Texas

#s25
and I read you know how our politicians voted each week in the paper

#s27
And it 's you know it 's interesting how the votes vary

#s28
and what they ran on in platform do n't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or Congress whatever

#s53
I work for Plano

#s57

#s62
Our taxes went up tremendously

#s63
Yes

#s68
Yes

#s69
I remember there was about four five years ago

#s71
Yes

#s74
Yes

well did you read in the Dallas paper where they increased the teach- the administrators ' pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers

#s79
Right

#s80
But you know I 'm not going to complain because Plano got we all got a pay raise this year

#s82
You all got a pay raise this year

#s84
Is that correct

#s91
Okay

#s93
