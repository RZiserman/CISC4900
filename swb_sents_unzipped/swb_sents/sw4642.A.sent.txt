I uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair

#s2
Actually uh that is really a sore spot with me

#s3
I I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving

#s4
but uh like ten years ago uh reliability of automobiles at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal

#s5
and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal

#s7
and uh it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea

#s9
But uh I

#s11
Pardon

#s13
Well at that time actually I had a Volkswagen Rabbit

#s15
and uh it was it was a real lemon

#s16
Uh subsequently I got a uh Buick Century

#s17
and it was n't as bad

#s19
But uh last year I bought a Honda Accord

#s20
and I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance

#s21
and that is it

#s22
And it 's wonderful

#s29
Huh

#s33
Huh

#s35
Huh

#s37
So wha- what do you have

#s39
All the more reason to uh have a a Honda

#s45
so you bought a Pontiac

#s55
Now thi-

#s56
wha- how old is the car

#s58
Huh

#s64
Huh

#s76
Huh

#s81
So apparently it was the same one that was on there

#s83
Apparently just uh re- re- uh probably filled the the brake fluid up

#s84
and that was it

#s89
So what 's the solution to that

#s90
I guess find a reputable service

#s92
Huh

#s95
Uh-huh

#s99
Right

#s103
Well that 's wonderful

#s105
You 're lucky

#s113
Oh really

#s120
Huh
