#s2
Uh we do here

#s3
Uh see what do we recycle

#s4
We they recycle

#s5
they have bins

#s7
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and uh plastic bottles

#s8
and I think that 's all they have

#s10
What about you guys

#s13
Uh-huh

#s19
Really

#s21
For smashed cans

#s23
Uh-huh

#s25
Oh can you can you hold on for just a minute

#s27
I 'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because

#s28
okay

#s29
just succeed

#s32
Oh okay

#s33
well I guess I guess

#s35
Yeah

#s36
Okay

#s37
well anyways you guys only get a penny a can

#s38
Well when you buy like uh canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit

#s41
Yeah

#s42
Exactly

#s43
and so it 's like they charge you for the deposit

#s44
so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you 're just like reimbursed

#s46
Type of thing

#s50
That 's sort of nice though

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Yeah

#s57
so you guys can actually get ahead

#s59
But uh they have sort of like uh things that you c- you 're not like reimbursed for or paid for

#s60
Like we can recycle uh clear glass brown glass green glass Uh and milk jugs and uh newspapers you know

#s62
everyone does newspapers

#s66
But that that kind of stuff

#s68
But they they said they ca n't be smashed or else uh it does n't fit in their little containers

#s69
and they 're not reimbursed by the the people who are over them or something

#s71
Yeah

#s72
Exactly

#s73
yeah

#s74
send it to this address

#s75
no

#s76
But uh let 's see

#s77
they said that how ways can encourage recycling uh

#s81
Yeah

#s82
that 's

#s84
Uh-huh

#s86
As likely to do it

#s87
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s89
that 's true

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Yeah

#s96
Yeah

#s97
exactly

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
Yeah

#s104
Uh-huh

#s106
Oh that 's good

#s107
Uh another thing I thought of I guess to recycle would be like clothes because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other

#s108
And one way that we do it sort of in in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops

#s110
And that way you know you do n't get near enough as as much as you bought it for

#s111
but you you got the use out of it

#s112
and what you 're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for

#s114
And so that 's something that I 've never

#s116
I we 're we 're new to Iowa

#s117
so that 's something that I had n't you know looked into before

#s118
But that 's one way to sort of get money and still recycle I guess
