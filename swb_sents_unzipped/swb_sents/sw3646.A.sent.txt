#s1
Okay

#s2
uh so what do you think about the school system

#s6
Uh why did you choose a private school

#s9
Public school

#s10
Oh has he

#s12
Then how does he like it

#s16
So he 's been there all the time

#s20
How big of a school is it

#s23
A hundred per grade that 's a good size

#s26
Kind of gives them the you know

#s27
I get a little leery of the real small ones that they do n't get much interaction with kids

#s28
but uh

#s32
So they do n't

#s33
That 's good

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Huh

#s41
Right

#s42
Still enjoy the

#s43
Right

#s44
Uh one thing I think I 've noticed is uh

#s45
my oldest is in kindergarten

#s46
so I 'm in a little different ballgame

#s48
I 'm just starting her

#s49
but uh seems to me that uh kids these days uh can really get away with murder

#s50
and the teachers do n't have as much are n't respected as much

#s51
and uh they have to be so careful of the things they do and say

#s55
And uh makes me a little nervous that uh students do n't seem to show that respect

#s56
and

#s58
No

#s59
Heavens

#s60
no

#s63
No

#s64
you would n't

#s66
And uh the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what I understand uh I think that 's wrong

#s67
I think we need to get back to the show some respect

#s68
and course I guess the teacher used to warrant that

#s69
but

#s73
Right

#s74
For other people

#s75
and

#s77
Well how do you think that that 's happened

#s78
You think our society 's just uh stopped talking out

#s79
or this uh generation 's just kind of changed a little bit uh

#s83
Right

#s88
Right

#s90
That just is n't coming through is it

#s91
No

#s92
I mean I remember uh well it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi 's

#s93
We used to have to wear dresses

#s96
and then you had to a- go to dresses

#s97
they had to be a pantsuit

#s98
and it was polyester

#s99
and it had to be matching

#s100
and

#s103
Yes

#s105
Exactly

#s106
Yes

#s108
Yes

#s109
so it 's really changed

#s110
It 's uh really kind of gone the rounds

#s111
so I think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree

#s112
They say you kind of act how you 're dressed a little bit

#s113
so I

#s117
Do uh does this school your son goes to do they uh re- require to wear a uniform

#s118
or

#s121
Uh-huh

#s122
Yeah

#s123
there are quite a few of your s-
