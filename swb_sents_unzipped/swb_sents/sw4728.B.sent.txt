#s1
I do n't know what you drive now

#s2
I mean what do you drive now

#s5
Oh okay

#s7
Throw them in the back

#s11
Cab

#s12
Oh yeah

#s15
Yeah

#s18
There you go

#s20
Yeah

#s21
yo-

#s23
Right

#s24
yeah

#s25
I know

#s29
Yeah

#s30
you 're looking at

#s31
I got a Toyota Four Runner

#s32
I wanted a truck that I I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too

#s33
so I got a Four Runner

#s37
You 're just like me

#s38
I 've never bought a new vehicle in my life

#s42
No

#s44
Let somebody else break it in

#s45
right

#s51
Yeah

#s54
Right

#s56
Right

#s59


#
Yeah

#s62
my my MUMBLEx

#s63
pretty much the same

#s64
I I got a like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners

#s66
and uh it pretty much does everything I need it to

#s67
I mean it it 'll tow three thousand pounds

#s68
so I can tow everything

#s69
and it

#s70
I can throw

#s71
I 've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not

#s73
And uh it 's real reliable

#s74
belie-

#s75
I I mean I 've had it for almost four years now

#s76
and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it

#s78
And then of course two weeks ago it decided

#s79
I do n't know

#s80
it 's the strangest weirdest thing in the world

#s81
but it blew a head gasket

#s83
Did n't do any damage to it

#s84
Uh I caught it real early

#s87
Uh oh ninety-seven thousand

#s89
So it 's not real early

#s91
No

#s92
Never overheated it

#s93
I smell I smelled the uh I smelled the coolant

#s95
Went out and looked

#s96
Saw it was saw where it was coming from

#s97
Drove it right to the shop and left it off

#s100
And that was it

#s101
because I I have that

#s102
and then I have a a Kawasaki motorcycle Which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it 's not raining

#s105
I mean that 's that 's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle

#s106
It it 's a

#s107
I do n't know

#s108
people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves

#s115
I know

#s116
but I bet you he really enjoys riding it

#s119
Yeah

#s120
So you know yo-

#s121
h-

#s122
when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving

#s123
Yeah

#s125
And I go out twice a week on the bike so At least Just for the enjoyment

#s129
But yeah

#s130
I I mean the only thing I think I might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car

#s131
uh I would consider going to a a non to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one I 've got Just because there 's a lot of times I wished I had ju- just an open bed to throw stuff in

#s134
I 'm sure I 'm sure that that 's very

#s135
I mean you got one

#s136
It 's that 's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back

#s137
and

#s139
Right

#s141
To have it out of the way

#s142
Right

#s145
I think they last a lot longer than anything else

#s148
Yeah

#s149
yeah

#s150
the trucks do

#s151
Uh even though you know the Jap the little Jap trucks are are good there too

#s152
But so are the

#s153
though I think the Chevies

#s154
I do n't think the Che-

#s155
I do n't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords

#s157
I think they I think the Fords tend to last a little longer At least until recently

#s162
A friend of mine just bought MUMBLEx bought like a year ago

#s163
It it 's a really nice truck

#s164
I mean I do n't like Dodges at all

#s165
but one of the Dodges they have out now has a uh the Cummins turbo diesel on it

#s168
Oh it 's beautiful

#s170
That thing that thing will last forever I mean

#s172
Oh yeah

#s173
that thing 's uh

#s174
it 's got a boat engine in it

#s178
Uh-huh
