#s1
So how is the weather out there

#s5
Oh really

#s8
Um Uh it 's just it 's a it 's about same

#s9
The usual I think

#s11
So nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff

#s12
It 's good

#s17
Oh really

#s18
What part

#s22
Oh really

#s23
Okay

#s29
It 's more humid in Utah than there

#s31
Or there

#s33
Okay

#s34
Right

#s36
Okay

#s41
Yeah

#s42
see that 's how it is in Texas too

#s43
because when it 's cold it 's really cold

#s44
So

#s47
What 's that

#s49
Right

#s50
Yeah

#s51
So the humidity is I think what does it

#s54
Because I I noticed when I got here too

#s55
because like I 'd

#s56
when it would snow in Texas uh I would just I mean we 'd be f- really cold

#s58
and we 'd have to get really warm

#s59
and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it 's snowing

#s60
and you do n't you do n't feel super cold

#s64
It was weird

#s66
But so how long ago did you graduate

#s67
Or did you

#s68
or

#s70
Oh really

#s75
Oh

#s76
So you just barely moved away

#s80
Do you like it out there

#s82
You do

#s83
Yeah

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
So you just moved away a year ago

#s90
Wow really recent

#s95
Oh warm

#s97
Oh man

#s98
it 's got to be like it 's probably fifty fifty-five maybe

#s100
Maybe not that warm

#s101
Probably about uh

#s102
yeah

#s103
It 's not it 's not that cold really

#s105
Yeah

#s107
Yeah

#s108
that 's a big deal in Texas too

#s110
Um

#s112
Yeah

#s113
that 's true

#s114
That makes a big difference

#s115
Huh

#s117
So did you used to ski when you were out here

#s119
Did you used to ski when you were in Utah

#s121
Oh really

#s124
Uh not tons

#s125
but I like to when I get a chance

#s127
I 've only been once so far but had the opportunity a couple times since then

#s128
Just saving my money for Christmas things and that

#s131
Uh no

#s132
this is actually my third year

#s134
Uh-huh

#s136
Yep

#s139
No

#s140
at B Y U

#s142
Yeah

#s144
So but I 'll be here a long time at this rate

#s146
Uh it was nursing

#s147
but I 'm in the process of changing it right now

#s150
Because it 's really really competitive at B Y U

#s152
You have to have like a three seven to get in

#s153
so It 's really

#s155
I 'm going to look into some other fields

#s156
I 'd like

#s157
all the science classes and that I 'm just not really enjoying too much

#s158
so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school

#s160
so

#s163
Did you graduate in a certain field

#s164
or

#s167
In

#s169
Really

#s171
That what my sister did

#s173
Yeah

#s174
you might know her

#s175
Here name is Lori Bird

#s176
Maybe not

#s177
I think she graduated around then too though eighty-seven probably

#s178
but she got her doc-

#s183
Yeah

#s184
yeah

#s185
Because they since uh stopped that program I mean where you can where you can get it double pretty easily

#s188
I mean it 's it 's really
