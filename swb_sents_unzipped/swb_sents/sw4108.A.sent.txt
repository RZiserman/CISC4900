Uh so what do you think uh about putting the elderly in a nursing home

#s4
Huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s9
That 's true

#s10
Yeah

#s12
Huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s19
That 's true

#s20
I never thought of that

#s21
Yeah

#s23
That 's true

#s24
until they get over that hump of whatever it is they 're dealing with

#s27
Yes

#s28
They really are

#s29
They do n't like to keep them longer than a week

#s31
Yeah

#s34
What do you mean

#s37
Yeah

#s38
that 's true

#s41
Yeah

#s42
and it depends on how how sick the person is too

#s43
What you 're capable of

#s44
like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own

#s46
Yeah

#s47
uh I would personally like it

#s48
if my parents were to get ill I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help

#s49
That 's not always possible

#s51
But uh to the best of my ability I 'd like to do it until it gets impossible

#s54
Right

#s55
Uh-huh

#s56
Yeah

#s58
That 's true

#s59
Yeah

#s61
But I think nursing homes can be good

#s62
It just depends on what kind they are

#s63
You know you need to check them out ahead of time

#s66
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70
Yeah

#s71
that they 're

#s74
Yeah

#s76
Right

#s77
Who know what they 're doing with that

#s80
Yeah

#s81
well my uh grandmother 's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it

#s82
And she really liked the idea of of moving there

#s83
She 's not ill yet

#s85
but uh she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years

#s86
and then she decided that uh she 's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she does n't want her family taking care of her and being a burden

#s87
She 's very independent

#s88
So she 's in this nursing home

#s89
It 's out in the country

#s90
and uh she really enjoys it right now because she does n't have to wash dishes or cook

#s92
Uh-huh

#s94
Right

#s95
Some support

#s96
And then there 's also uh sort of a wing for those people that do get sick

#s97
and what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now

#s98
and then so if she ever does become ill uh it will be like family around her

#s101
Yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
Yeah

#s105
Sh-

#s107
Uh-huh

#s108
No

#s109
she loves it

#s110
She has a great social life

#s111
and she travels

#s112
and uh it 's in in the very in the mountains

#s113
and it 's beautiful

#s114
and uh I I hope that I have something like that when I get older

#s117
Uh-huh

#s118
Uh-huh

#s119
Oh definitely it 's

#s122
Right
