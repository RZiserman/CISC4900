Well here in Logan Utah we 've got a nice little valley here

#s3
and it 's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in

#s4
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley

#s12
Yeah

#s13
Yeah

#s14
Definitely

#s15
Here in Utah up along the Wasatch MUMBLEx along the western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan 's up in the valley a little bit further north we get a lot of pollution

#s16
and it 's like seventy percent of it is from cars

#s18
And uh it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion And when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above

#s19
and it just sits and sits and sits

#s20
and we 're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago

#s22
It 's not it 's almost sad

#s23
Because when I grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys

#s24
and now it 's not in the mountain valleys

#s30
Huh

#s32
They 're getting serious about things like uh mandatory

#s33
well they 've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you 're in certain counties

#s34
emissions

#s37
Yeah

#s38
They 've actually started doing it down along the

#s39
not in Logan up here cause we 're doing a lot better

#s40
We have a lot population is a lot lighter up here

#s46
Yeah

#s47
Yeah

#s48
They 're ge- eliminating that out here

#s50
They 're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun Where they 're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust

#s51
Kind of like a radar gun

#s52
And

#s55
Yes

#s56
Yeah

#s57
Do it remotely just looking at the

#s58
what they do they do several different types of things

#s59
Sometimes they put a source light

#s60
and they look at the source light

#s61
and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it

#s62
and you can look at the emissions actually

#s64
And

#s66
Like across the street

#s67
They 'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense

#s69
And they 're also looking at uh other you know ways of monitoring this and cause they 've found out something basically that uh

#s70
and a poorly tuned car can emit something

#s71
it 's an incredible amount

#s72
It was like four hundred times as much uh of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a properly tuned car

#s74
And and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know you it 'd be one way to cut the pollution in half

#s82
Uh-huh

#s85
Huh

#s87
Yeah

#s88
And they 're
