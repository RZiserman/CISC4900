#s4
Uh yes

#s5
I think so

#s6
Uh

#s9
Yeah

#s10
I do n't kn-

#s13
Yeah

#s14
I believe that 's right

#s16
And uh and I do n't know that that 's really what we 're talking about

#s25
Yeah

#s26
for for kids in high school it could be in the summertime

#s29
Uh you know um it it could even be done while they 're doing another job while they 're doing you know a job to make money

#s31
But uh it 's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it

#s32
I think the family would have to be involved in it

#s34
And people would have to be convinced that you know

#s35
I I think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving

#s38
And that 's not the kind of society we have right now

#s43
There 's lots and lots of volunteer programs

#s44
and uh but most of those are at l- least it it 's my opinion that most of those involve adults Adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire to to give

#s49
It 's not uh you know it 's not uh

#s50
maybe the maybe it cou- uh

#s51
younger people feel like it 's not open to them

#s52
I do n't know

#s53
But it should be if it 's not

#s57
Yeah

#s58
it is kind of an introspective time of life

#s60
But some schools some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to uh you know areas economically uh say less advantaged areas

#s63
And uh they they promote service on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people

#s64
So at least that 's a step in the right direction I guess

#s70
It 's really it 's really unfortunate because when you do

#s71
I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association

#s73
And I have have done uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society

#s74
And there 's there 's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved

#s76
Uh it 's it 's really a gift to yourself

#s77
and and that 's I think that 's a really important lesson to learn

#s79
And and maybe that 's why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy you know

#s81
Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you 're just kind of down the tube you know

#s84
Uh really is better to give then to receive
