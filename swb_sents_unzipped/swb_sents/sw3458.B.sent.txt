Okay

#s2
you ready

#s5
That 's it

#s8
What what kind do you subscribe to

#s9
or do you

#s14
I uh take a computer magazine And uh also uh BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS

#s18
And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside And the cardboard pages

#s34
Well that 's true

#s35
I uh I like it when they have short stories

#s36
Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it

#s40
And I have n't bought a REDBOOK in a while

#s41
so I guess

#s43
I I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore

#s46
Yeah

#s47
I think it is

#s48
Surely

#s49
it 's an institution

#s50
surely it would have to be

#s52
But

#s58
Right

#s61
Mine too

#s62
This was it my last chance

#s67
Well I I I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh to uh ENTERTAINMENT

#s71
And I was real disappointed with it

#s73
I I do n't know

#s74
it just

#s75
not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into

#s77
It 's little short articles more than anything else

#s79
And that 's one thing I do n't like about PEOPLE

#s80
Uh it 's just you know does n't seem to have enough story to it

#s83
If you 've only got a short time to read

#s85
No

#s86
that 's true

#s93
Uh no

#s94
not really

#s95
I mean not the one I take now

#s96
It 's a it 's a magazine

#s97
and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes

#s100
And uh I 'm a real movie buff

#s101
so that 's why I thought I might be interested in it

#s102
but it just has n't been what I thought it would be

#s104
And uh my mother has subscribed to is the reason I get uh the HOME JOURNAL and the uh computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me

#s106
Otherwise if if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf I 'll pick it up then Rather than having them delivered and think oh I really need to read this

#s112
Yeah

#s116
Well I I do like recipes and crafts

#s119
That 's true

#s123
Do you uh
