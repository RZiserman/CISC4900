Hi

#s4
My name is uh Donna Donahue

#s5
and I live in Plano Texas

#s9
Oh okay

#s10
Um do you want to start

#s11
or should I start

#s13
Okay um

#s14
I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in

#s15
We have um three children

#s16
and um they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball

#s17
and well my little girl goes to tap dance

#s18
and my little one goes to preschool

#s19
and um I 'm home with the children

#s20
just do a lot of running around

#s21
It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type I do n't know life

#s22
Um what about you

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
Uh-huh

#s28
Okay

#s30
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Was sort of maintenance free

#s37
Yeah

#s38
Oh yeah

#s39
well um that that sounds that sounds pretty good for

#s40
I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds

#s41
and it 's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it

#s42
It 's

#s44
sometimes I think um it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility

#s49
Right

#s52
Oh that sounds lovely

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
So in in your area then there 's probably a lot of um career type people that have those type homes

#s59
and

#s62
uh-huh

#s63
and um the area that we 're settled in is um definitely young young families with with kids

#s64
They 're still doing um a lot of building in the neighborhood

#s65
So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we 're from um the northeast

#s66
and um seems like a people just do n't or also do n't have any family around

#s67
So it um also gives you a common bond when you do n't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors

#s68
and you know um But um MUMBLEx

#s70
Uh-huh

#s72
Right

#s73
right

#s74
Uh-huh

#s75
Now it 's um is it very wooded around where you are

#s76
there lots of pretty trees and

#s78
Yeah

#s80
Oh how pretty

#s82
I do miss that

#s83
Around here in Plano there are very few trees

#s84
and it 's pretty flat and and kind of barren

#s85
and that 's the only thing that we do n't like about living in Texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall

#s86
and and um uh the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is you know in the north Um or even where you are

#s88
A lot of leaves to rake up too I bet

#s91
Does that

#s92
well see that 's another plus

#s97
That 's right

#s98
that 's right

#s99
they are

#s100
I 'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done

#s101
We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not not much

#s102
Just just a little

#s103
kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks

#s104
and if you did n't do anything about it then they 'd probably the leaves just blow away

#s106
It 's not too bad

#s107
Okay

#s108
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time

#s111
Okay

#s112
Okay

#s113
It was really nice speaking to you

#s115
Okay

#s116
and have a happy Thanksgiving

#s119
Bye-bye
