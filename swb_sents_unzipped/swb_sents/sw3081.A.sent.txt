Okay

#s2
well I I I guess if I was having a dinner party I depending on the number of people I might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish

#s4
and um I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a a potato dish

#s5
and we usually serve fresh fruit and uh then make a dessert

#s7
So that makes

#s18
Well that sounds good

#s20
That sounds good

#s25
Bread do you have bread to go with it

#s29
Gosh

#s32
Oh well lasagna 's always wonderful for large crowds

#s34
I 've heard you know I 've heard a lot of people say it the short cut on the cooking for lasagna

#s35
they they 've told me that they go to Sam 's and buy a great big pan of lasagna

#s37
So

#s39
Did you

#s41
Well I I know people that have have served it

#s42
and they say gosh if you have company coming when you do n't want to be always in the kitchen it 's easy

#s44
and she said it 's they said it 's good

#s46
So that that 's always sounds good to me um

#s48
I feel like I feel like I 'm in the kitchen cooking a lot

#s50
I cook guess I cook a seems like I cook a lot of dinners oh not always for company just for just for family

#s52
So feels like I 'm often in the kitchen

#s54
But a time consuming place

#s55
Yeah

#s56
right

#s57
right

#s58
so

#s64
I do n't know

#s65
what that is

#s66
No

#s67
I do n't know what that is

#s70
Okay

#s71
Right

#s76
Right

#s88
Right

#s94
Right

#s95
Right

#s96
Do you like to make your own guacamole

#s98
Yeah

#s99
we we do n't make it very often I guess

#s100
but uh

#s104
Oh do they

#s106
Gosh

#s109
Gosh

#s110
Oh that 's good

#s111
that 's good

#s112
or it 's always good on top of something in the sandwich

#s115
Oh well we made I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day

#s116
and and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad

#s119
Well I do n't know

#s120
I guess they do n't have it at home

#s123
They must they just said they never had it at home

#s124
So I I was concerned that

#s125
I thought oh taking this you know taking this as a dip I thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly

#s127
so I just

#s129
Oh does that help

#s132
Okay

#s133
well

#s135
Well I 'll have to remember that

#s136
Well I just I that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top

#s137
and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would

#s139
so

#s141
I thought maybe that was the trick

#s143
Yeah

#s144
yeah

#s145
so Oh well I guess we bought a lot of

#s146
we 've been buying turkey lately instead of beef

#s147
so

#s149
even though you know

#s152
the ground turkey it 's the meat is softer

#s153
and I

#s154
everybody seems to like it

#s156
So Sometimes it seems to be cheaper too

#s157
so we often buy it

#s160
we buy it

#s162
Yeah

#s163
yeah

#s164
so we bought that

#s165
or we bought the the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets

#s166
and I do n't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them

#s169
Or in

#s175
Yeah

#s176
yeah

#s178
Less cho- less cholesterol Yeah

#s180
right

#s181
right

#s182
Well I guess that 's probably all we need to do for tonight

#s186
I always like dessert

#s190
Right

#s191
right

#s193
that 's always good

#s194
Probably probably the only family recipe that we we make and it 's really for special occasions is cheese cake

#s195
and we take a recipe from my grandmother you know

#s197
it 's probably fairly typical

#s198
cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a
