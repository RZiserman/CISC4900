#s4
Uh-huh

#s8
Well we have it just opposite here

#s9
My wife works in you know at at at the T I

#s10
and she 's uh sedentary all day long

#s11
so when she gets home she likes to mow

#s14
And we have about ten acres

#s15
and she tries to mow about half of it

#s18
Well yeah

#s19
it keeps uh well

#s20
it 's doing real well

#s21
because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed

#s23
I mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places

#s25
and now you know since we 've been mowing it

#s26
and you know of course we water a little bit

#s27
that 's just too much to water all at once

#s28
but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we 've reclaimed a lot of it

#s31
Yeah

#s32
but we do n't do much in the way of uh flowers

#s33
We have one little flower garden that we that we work with

#s35
The rest of it is just like wild flowers

#s37
and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers

#s39
They 're about oh I guess a third the size of your palm of your hand

#s41
and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush

#s48
Yeah

#s49
Well my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing

#s51
Uh she enjoys mowing

#s52
I ca n't believe it

#s55
I mean I hate it

#s66
Right

#s69
We do n't even have any concrete or asphalt

#s78
Uh-huh

#s79
Yeah

#s80
but you know we do everything together

#s82
This this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the

#s83
actually this fall I was talking about

#s84
two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people

#s87
and uh we 're in the process of of planting

#s89
and we 're building a stand uh just to the north of our house and along the east uh property line

#s91
and I uh I think what we 're what we 're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because I tell you in the winter time when that when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you 're not even there

#s94
So

#s97
On the other side of the house though that 's where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums

#s98
and we have morning glory

#s100
and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers

#s101
and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water

#s103
and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long

#s106
And well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house

#s110
Well yeah

#s111
they do n't like it in here because there 's nothing to eat

#s113
and when you 're as busy as one of those babies you 've got to eat most of the time

#s115
And we got a few you know

#s116
we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders

#s118
But you know for the most part gardening for us is

#s119
well we got asparagus

#s120
and uh we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries

#s122
Man we get the best strawberries that you just ca n't believe

#s124
We just got our last tomatoes

#s126
Yeah

#s129
Well these are accidental tomatos

#s131
Well last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes

#s132
of course you 're going to lose some that way

#s134
and the seeds go right through them

#s136
And wherever they pooped
