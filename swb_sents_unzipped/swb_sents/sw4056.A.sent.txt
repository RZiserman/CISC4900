#s1
Okay

#s2
should begin

#s5
Uh I can begin this um

#s6
basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis

#s8
and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good

#s9
I 'm I 'm pretty pleased with it

#s10
They cover uh just about everything vision dental medical

#s12
uh you name it

#s13
and for me this is the first job I 've had where they 've covered that much

#s14
so I 'm pretty satisfied myself

#s16
Um what 's your situation

#s19
Oh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s25
Are you a professor there

#s29
Oh I see

#s30
okay

#s32
Oh no doubt

#s35
Right

#s36
Well that 's good

#s38
Yeah

#s39
that 's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell is uh

#s40
I used to work with the Army Research Institute

#s41
and being a uh a government organization you got quite a few holidays off

#s43
But here you do n't get that

#s44
You maybe get two or three a year

#s46
So it 's really

#s47
unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time

#s49
So that 's that 's kind of a drawback I think

#s50
But uh I do n't know

#s51
What do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
Yeah

#s60
Yeah

#s61
I do n't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night they uh they basically reviewed Oregon 's plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing

#s64
It 's kind of an interesting plan

#s65
It 's kind of cold though

#s66
They 've essentially made up a list of uh oh all the different uh medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff

#s68
about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care

#s69
and the ones above would

#s70
Um

#s71
So it 's kind of like drawing this line

#s72
and and if you have it great

#s73
if you do n't you 're kind of out of luck

#s75
but um it was kind of an interesting show

#s76
Um

#s77
I think you 're right

#s78
I think health care is probably the the most pressing uh the pressing one

#s79
Right

#s80
but I 'll tell you I I do n't mind having dental you know

#s81
sometimes dental costs can be um just about as expensive if not more

#s82
and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
but I 'm not sure that 's that 's widely followed any more

#s85
I 'm not sure

#s86
how how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it

#s90
Um

#s93
Great

#s95
Is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh professors and and also staff and administration

#s96
is that generally across the board do you think

#s101
Right

#s106
Uh-huh

#s107
Oh okay

#s109
Right

#s111
Yeah

#s112
I 'm kind of interested because I 'm actually that 's the route I 'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to uh is to teach in a university

#s114
Uh-huh

#s115
I 'm a doctoral student in Florida right now

#s117
but uh

#s118
yeah

#s119
that 's that 's interesting

#s120
That 's one of the things I 'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that

#s122
Oh is that right
