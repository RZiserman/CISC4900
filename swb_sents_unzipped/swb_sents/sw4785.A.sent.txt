#s2
Yeah MUMBLEx

#s6
Well twenty-seven up

#s7
Uh

#s8
And we had five

#s10
Oh yeah

#s11
And how about yourself

#s13
Oh

#s14
well

#s17
Yeah

#s18
Well when mine were growing up I did some traveling and but not that extensively

#s19
but I always MUMBLEx just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them

#s21
So it was an hour you know

#s23
But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them

#s25
Six years

#s27
Yeah

#s30
Oh yeah

#s31
We look back and wonder how we did it

#s33
No

#s34
she never did

#s36
MUMBLEx

#s38
Well yeah

#s39
yeah

#s43
Yeah

#s45
Well that 's plenty though

#s53
Yeah

#s54
Right

#s55
Well you know with kids you 're not going to have a neat house

#s57
And you know it it 's tough to find time E- espec- especially with both of them working

#s62
And you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it

#s66
Right

#s69
Right

#s74
Well that 's good too

#s75
Yeah

#s76
that 's good that way too

#s79
Yeah

#s80
Well that they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day

#s82
And you know and as the kids got older I made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too Or whatever

#s85
and

#s87
Oh yeah

#s90
And uh well yeah

#s91
if

#s94
Yeah

#s95
Just keep them talking that way

#s98
But uh another thing we used to do is have family councils Every Sunday night

#s102
Discuss everything that did n't agree with them

#s103
And we 'd take turns being president

#s105
And everyone would get one vote

#s106
And I always thought we 'd get outvoted five to two

#s108
but it never worked that way

#s110
Yeah

#s111
Well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too

#s114
And that was always good time

#s115
Boy we really got to know the kids well

#s118
Oh yeah

#s119
In fact they were all in uh over the weekend for Easter

#s124
Well we did too

#s126
And I remember the one daughter saying

#s127
we had a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree

#s129
and she said hey I do n't make fun fun of your friends

#s130
so why make fun of mine

#s132
Kind of r- kind of hit us between the eyes

#s136
No

#s137
But that that was always good quality time for us

#s140
And then never attend

#s141
but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules

#s143
Yeah

#s144
and boy they they 'd show up

#s146
And we 'd usually take notes

#s148
and you know the younger kids uh or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another

#s150
And uh but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us

#s151
And they loved it

#s154
Yeah

#s156
Yeah

#s158
Yeah

#s159
But uh boy I I feel for you and your husband

#s161
Well my my uh two of my uh
