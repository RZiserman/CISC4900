I uh get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio

#s2
Uh that is one of my big sources for current events information

#s3
Uh I really like that coverage

#s4
My wife uh on the other hand is home most of the day

#s5
and she watches a lot of the cable news network

#s6
Have you seen uh h- have you uh ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED

#s9
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s19
I 'm uh interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it

#s20
Uh how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world uh compares with the American coverage of

#s21
how do you think that uh the viewpoints differ

#s24
Uh-huh

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Do you think then that uh the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts

#s39
Uh-huh

#s40
Which uh which approach do you find to be uh more useful the

#s41
the interpretive approach or the straight reporting

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Uh-huh

One of the things that I found interesting last year during the uh the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available

#s51
Uh there was a there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely uh uh hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory

#s52
and while he was being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda

#s53
but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that th- you know this is n't a baby milk factory

#s54
how could he say it was uh

#s55
I I think that that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
