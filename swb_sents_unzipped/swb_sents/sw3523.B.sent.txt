#s2
Okay

#s4
Oh I guess the first thing has been the uh for the right for women to vote

#s5
I think that has been a major change and also the fact that uh there are so mu- many more women in the work force nowadays than there were

#s6
and that 's probably going to increase You know

#s9
I 'm sorry

#s11
It sure does

#s12
Yeah

#s13
there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays

#s15
Role

#s16
Right

#s18
That 's changing

#s20
Right

#s22
Right

#s23
yeah

#s24
I I agree

#s25
It definitely has changed

#s27
Uh-huh

#s29
Yeah

#s30
yeah

#s32
Well you know they 've been talking about

#s33
and I do n't know uh what the status is on it

#s34
but you know women get maternity leave and stuff like that

#s35
and I know that they 've there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out

#s37
but you know I have n't really heard much about that recently

#s39
Uh-huh

#s42
Oh is that right

#s43
Oh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s50
Huh that 's interesting

#s51
That 's a bummer though

#s54
I mean You got to take the time off

#s59
Yeah

#s61
Uh-huh

#s63
I think that we 're probably going to see a lot more companies uh run by females

#s66
And we 'll prob-

#s67
I 'm sorry

#s69
Right

#s70
right

#s71
upper management

#s72
more women in upper management

#s73
and probably uh we 'll see more females in political roles

#s74
More governors and I think you know roles like that

#s76
Well we 've got in Texas we have a female governor

#s79
And we had a female mayor here in Dallas

#s80
and she just her term just ended

#s81
and uh so I think we 're probably going to see more of that in the future

#s85
Uh-huh

#s88
Right you know

#s89
I mean and that 's fine with me

#s91
but sometimes

#s92
I mean I 'm not a women 's libber by any means

#s93
but I do

#s95
there are issues that you know as far as like equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff I totally am for

#s97
But I do n't get into the uh the real women libber movement you know

#s101
Yeah

#s103
Right

#s104
right

#s106
Yeah

#s108
Right

#s111
Yeah

#s112
I I 've heard of that

#s113
Uh I have n't really talked to anybody that 's you know too involved with that

#s114
But I mean I think that is a

#s116
Like the cottage industry

#s117
Is is that what you 're talking about women working out of their homes

#s119
Yeah

#s120
uh I think it 's wonderful

#s124
Yeah

#s126
Oh I kn-

#s127
By the phone and all that

#s130
Right

#s133
Right

#s134
Yeah

#s135
I would n't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up

#s140
Right

#s142
Right
