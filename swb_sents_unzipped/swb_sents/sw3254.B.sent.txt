#s3
Oh I generally go to the quickie places just because they 're cheap

#s6
Uh we have four

#s7
but most of them are gone now

#s9
so there there might be

#s10
but we were taking you know uh four five and six people out

#s13
Yes

#s15
I 'm in Texas

#s19
And we live- we lived in Ohio prior to this

#s22
Uh we were up near Cleveland

#s24
Yeah

#s25
uh but I look for service even at the quickie places type things

#s27
Uh I do n't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong

#s29
and then you 're stuck

#s30
and it 's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave

#s32
so I really do n't like the drive-thrus that much

#s33
I I like to go and eat there

#s34
But I would say service uh atmosphere and whether the food is good

#s35
and on going out I like steaks

#s36
So we try to hit those places when we can

#s39
Uh-huh

#s42
Yeah

#s44
Uh yeah

#s45
and in in in the countries unless it 's a large city I guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main

#s48
That 's what you find

#s49
right

#s51
My husband likes uh Dairy Queens

#s52
He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs I guess

#s54
so he 's a fan of of Dairy Queen

#s55
and and we 'll go even in town here at times just as a a change although I 'm not that excited about it

#s57
But we 've eat we eat out so much it 's gotten so I do n't like to really eat any place

#s58
but yet I hate to cook food at home

#s60
so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we 're eating out probably five nights a week maybe

#s63
Or we eat junk food at home

#s65
uh now my husba-

#s67
Oh we 'll go to them all

#s68
We sort of take turns

#s69
And we uh

#s70
I sort of favor the ones

#s71
if I have a coupon we can go there

#s72
and if not we ca n't because it 's cheaper

#s74
so mine is monetarily I guess strongly monetarily based

#s75
Uh we 'll go get pizza and uh at Little Caesar 's although the kids prefer Domino 's

#s77
Right

#s79
But it 's just a lot cheaper than than Domino 's

#s80
so that 's

#s81
We go to Grandy 's quite a bit I would say

#s84
McDonald 's uh we 've sort of been off of that for a while

#s85
and no particular reason

#s86
and I

#s87
maybe we avoided Wendy 's the last few years because our daughter worked there

#s88
and she never wanted us to show up there

#s90
so I do n't we do n't go there that much

#s92
A nice meal oh

#s94
It 's usually when we 're out of town

#s96
and I 'll order steak or steak and lobster combined

#s98
so it 's really not in town

#s101
No

#s103
Uh-huh

#s108
Uh-huh

#s112
Right

#s116
But well we do n't go out that much

#s117
I gue- well I guess we do go out without kids

#s118
We 're usually picking things up quickly

#s119
though we just do n't dwell on food too much

#s121
and uh with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places

#s124
so it does n't really matter to him

#s125
He 'd probably just like to stay home

#s131
Well I think I I never have liked to cook food

#s132
but I think it all began eating out when we had uh the boys in in different uh baseball on baseball tea-

#s134
it was mainly baseball teams

#s136
and my husband would coach

#s137
so we were never home at the same time

#s139
I 'm not one that 's going to fix you know the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they 're there

#s141
If they 're not there in between five and six well then I guess we do n't eat today

#s142
or you go you know you fend for yourself

#s144
You go somewhere else

#s145
So that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when I started to sub make money

#s146
I went Oh well

#s147
I 'll just sub to

#
