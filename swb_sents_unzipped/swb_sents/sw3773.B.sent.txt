Homes

#s4
yes sir

#s5
uh-huh

#s6
What are are you settled in a place

#s11
Right

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
Okay

#s17
Well we uh left here in seventy-six

#s18
Uh we were here for a few years

#s19
then we uh have come back just this summer

#s20
Right now we 're looking for housing uh somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area

#s21
Are you familiar with that

#s24
Yeah

#s25
it is

#s26
The kids are in school here in Duncanville

#s27
We 're in a temporary place right now

#s28
and uh so they 've enjoyed the school

#s29
so we 're kind of trying to stay here

#s30
but

#s33
Well what the problem we got is that we 've got five children

#s35
and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house

#s36
and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing

#s38
so we uh we look at the paper

#s39
we look at our talk to our realtor

#s40
and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five

#s41
Sure

#s42
Are you looking

#s43
or you settled

#s44
I mean

#s48
H- having

#s52
Oh great

#s54
That empty nest syndrome is going to set in I guess

#s57
Great

#s58
Okay

#s59
Okay

#s60
you are you from Florida originally

#s64
Yeah

#s66
Oh yeah

#s68
Yeah

#s69
yeah

#s70
We 've got five

#s71
and the oldest is uh ninth grade

#s72
and the youngest is second grade

#s73
and I think they 're going to be uh with us forever

#s74
I do n't know if that 's true

#s75
but it 's sure you know

#s76
we 're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size

#s77
We 're we 're trying to find

#s80
Oh yeah

#s81
In fact six would be real good

#s83
My wife and I can share a bedroom

#s85
Either

#s86
Oh I do n't think it 's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that

#s87
Oh I know

#s91
Oh yeah

#s92
Yeah

#s93
it is

#s94
yeah

#s95
MUMBLEx

#s96
Uh we 're having

#s97
actually if we find something for uh I 'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we 'll be doing all right you know

#s98
Right

#s99
That 's uh

#s100
but I think the thing 's out there

#s101
it 's just a matter of uh you know looking you know finding the right place uh

#s107
Wow

#s110
Oh yeah

#s111
yeah

#s112
I think once we get into a place it will be just fine

#s113
but you know it 's until then it 's uh oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing

#s120
Oh yeah

#s121
Maybe that 's the case

#s122
At least she 's got more opinions you know

#s123
there 's uh seems like there 's more constraints more things that she thinks about You know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know

#s127
So What kind of business are you in

#s131
Oh yeah

#s132
great

#s134
Uh we 're with an organization called uh Wycliff Bible Translators

#s136
It 's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing

#s138
Uh it 's got an office down here in uh in near Duncanville

#s139
and we just moved down to be on staff down here

#s140
so

#s143
Right

#s145
Uh we were uh really surprised to find that they 're higher here Uh

#s147
When we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh I guess almost two or three times as high as we 'd expected

#s148
And then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower

#s149
and they 're not

#s150
I guess uh really prices for housing are just
