Hi

#s4
Uh books

#s5
I 've actually I am reading a couple of different books uh

#s6
one wa- is uh a story

#s7
well it is not a story

#s8
it is a collection of uh of memos supposedly written by Howard Hughes uh

#s10
that was uh that was

#s11
it came out a couple of years ago

#s12
and I have just now gotten around to reading it

#s13
I have had it a couple years

#s14
but uh jus- jus-

#s16
Oh I do not remember the man 's name

#s17
he was used to be a reporter for uh I think the NEW YORK TIMES or the WASHINGTON POST one of the two

#s18
and he supposedly got this this story uh I mean this uh was contacted by this guy who had these these memos he wanted to sell

#s19
and they were they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the uh corporate headquarters in uh in Los Angeles

#s21
They

#s22
on I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something there in Los Angeles they used to have a or I guess they still do uh had a uh uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices

#s23
and it was sort of nondescript for a uh you know for the size of the company

#s24
which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected

#s25
he he was uh a great collector of everything

#s26
he he he did not he did not throw anything away

#s27
and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for awhi-

#s28
he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile and uh And had ended up

#s30
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect

#s31
and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from from Hughes to uh to his main uh main a- assistant back uh in the fifties and si- well I guess in the sixties up until his death

#s34
So it 's pretty interesting work

#s35
so

#s37
Yeah

#s38
it 's a it 's a little it 's a little hard MUMBLEx

#s39
you have to plod through it

#s40
and you know it does not have a real story or any plot

#s42
you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on

#s44
No

#s45
I have not seen it

#s46
But it 's but it is it is real interesting

#s48
uh I also reading uh the uh

#s49
it 's a an old another old book that I happen to have

#s50
I am sort of rereading it

#s51
It 's uh a book about uh the Bermuda Triangle

#s52
but it 's uh it 's about it 's a real good book that a guy uh wrote who was uh a research librarian

#s53
he wrote uh sort of debunking many of the uh uh MUMBLEx the stories about the uh Bermuda Triangle You know

#s54
he he was thinking many many of the the myths many of the myths of the triangle were uh actually could be explained

#s57
and you know Uh and the rea- reason I was MUMBLEx picked it back up was in light of all the uh MUMBLEx Well when they found the uh the airplanes on the in the Atlantic thinking they were Flight Nineteen

#s58
And I do n't know if you are familiar with that at all

#s59
but it 's uh

#s60
Flight Nineteen was one of the uh was a a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two Right after World War Two

#s61
and they were they were lost

#s62
and uh

#s64
Yeah

#s65
they were

#s67
And so and in the book you know even

#s68
he wrote this book back in the seventies

#s69
and even and even then he he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water

#s70
And uh because he he mentions he he goes through and brings out points from the Navy 's findings and so forth

#s71
And uh it 's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and could not find their way back

#s74
Uh no

#s75
I have not

#s78
Yeah

#s79
I would I would like to too

#s80
because it 's a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of he- of where she MUMBLEx

#s82
Uh

#s85
Yeah

#s91
Right

#s93
Yeah

#s94
So that is pretty much for right now

#s95
that is what I have been reading

#s97
I kind of like to read different stuff

#s98
and uh I like to read a novel every now and then

#s99
but uh I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time

#s103
Yeah

#s106
Yes

#s109
Yeah

#s110

#s111
I got it uh right after it came out

#s112
My uh you know

#s114
he was an an assistant district attorney in Chicago at uh and while he was writing the book

#s115
and uh my sister-in-law lives in Chicago

#s116
