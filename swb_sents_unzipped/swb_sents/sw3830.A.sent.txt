#s34
Yeah

#s36
Because I I work for myself

#s38
and so uh there 's a lot that I that I guess I do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation

#s39
I miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come

#s43
But uh

#s48
Oh is that right

#s50

#s54
I uh I own part of a roofing company

#s56
In the in the Dallas Fort Worth area

#s58
And uh you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company

#s60
and they uh you know we we had all the benefits there

#s61
and and I do miss that You know

#s63
but uh on the other hand I I uh I enjoy having the the time that I have with my family and being able to you know work when I want

#s67
and

#s71
Uh-huh

#s74
Oh is that right

#s76

#s84
I 'll tell you what

#s85
that is the single most uh benefit that I that I enjoyed and I do miss

#s87
because I looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just

even at a group rate

#s96
Uh it 's it 's unbelievable

#s97

#s98
and and if you want to add dental to it I mean that 's that eats even more

#s102

#s105
and course these days you ca n't count on that because

#s107
uh you know I feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh M deal there in in Arlington

#s109
and I 'm sure it will be you know quite a few people are affected by that

#s110

#s137
really the

#s139
Yeah

#s140
really the ones it 's going to hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area

#s144
