#s11
and you know when when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants

#s13
I do n't I do n't particularly

#s14
I think it 's sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant

#s16

when when I go out it 's it 's normally to get um some specialty type of food

#s169
besides you know because y- chicken and steaks and everything I grill at home
