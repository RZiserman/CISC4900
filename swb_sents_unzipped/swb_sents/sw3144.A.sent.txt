You ready

#s3
Okay

#s4
What have you seen lately

#s10
Oh I 'm dying to see that

#s13
Oh

#s15
Uh-huh

#s20
Oh my goodness

#s22
Oh well I am just dying to see it

#s23
I went to dinner with some friends last weekend

#s24
and they said get a baby-sitter

#s25
and we 'll all go see REGARDING HENRY

#s27
and I said ooh I want to see it so bad

#s29
Oh

#s32
Yeah

#s34
Oh my

#s35
Well let me see

#s36
Was it

#s37
well we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS last weekend

#s38
and that may be

#s39
no

#s40
right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on

#s41
we 're going to the movies

#s42
And we wo n't

#s43
well she goes all the time

#s44
but I go maybe once every couple of months

#s46
And when I go I go see two at a time

#s47
So we went to see SOAPDISH

#s48
and

#s51
Oh hysterical

#s52
We laughed so hard

#s53
it was just

#s54
you could n't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard

#s58
Yeah

#s60
that 's the other one that we went to that night

#s62
And my face hurt so bad from laughing because I love Billy Crystal

#s64
And course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff so much of that was so true

#s65
and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles

#s66
It was so funny

#s67
Both of them were great

#s70
Oh they are are

#s71
we just laughed so hard

#s72
And like I said with CITY SLICK- I mean with SOAPDISH it is so cornball

#s73
and it is so overacted that you 're just hysterical you know

#s75
Just they just carried it off to the tee

#s77
No

#s79
How neat

#s84
Shoot

#s85
yeah

#s89
Oh yeah

#s95
Yeah

#s96
I think it is

#s97
I think it is

#s101
Yeah

#s103
Oh gosh

#s104
I never laughed

#s105
And people were just screaming and applauding

#s106
and you know it was just hysterical

#s108
Oh me too because I do n't even know if I could live through it now

#s110
I mean I 'm getting around real good

#s111
and I 'm just still real sore

#s113
And today I was I course I went back to work two weeks after uh

#s115
but see I do n't have permanent work

#s116
I right now I 'm working with a temporary agency

#s117
And so the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free

#s119
Oh so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that 's what everybody wants

#s120
and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed

#s122
And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day

#s123
And I said yeah

#s124
and I went

#s125
and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that

#s126
And uh I worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week

#s127
And so I went to my doctors last Thursday

#s128
and this was my fourth week checkup

#s129
and he said well gosh you 're just healing really well

#s130
I just ca n't get over this

#s131
He says in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things

#s132
If you want to play ball you can go play ball

#s133
He says now I 'm not going to say you 're going to feel like playing ball

#s134
but you can if you want to

#s136
And uh you know he was teasing me

#s137
and he says yeah you 'll be out there waterskiing

#s138
I can just see it now

#s139
And uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks

#s140
You 've only got two more weeks

#s141
I said okay fine I I will

#s142
I will

#s143
Whatever you call easy I 'll do it you know

#s144
But and I 've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it

#s147
And so I do n't I 'm real glad that we did n't go see those funny ones when I was when I 'm still sort of on the sore side

#s149
But

#s150
well wha- what 's your next

#s151

#s155

#s195
Oh yeah

#s202
I would n't think

#s203
Well my kids are going to their Dad 's tomorrow night

#s204
