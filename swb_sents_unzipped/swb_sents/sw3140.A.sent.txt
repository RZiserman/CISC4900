Hello

#s5
Hi Nola

#s6
I 'm Steve

#s7
I 'm in Dallas Texas

#s9
No

#s10
that 's unusual

#s11
Seems like usually

#s13
Oh yeah

#s14
I think all mine have been East Coast people so far

#s17
So

#s19
S- social changes

#s21
what 's that mean

#s23
Yeah

#s25
Yeah

#s26
Yeah

#s27
I definitely

#s28
I mean there 's plenty of things to talk about there

#s29
That 's a

#s31
Yeah

#s32
sure

#s35
Uh I was hoping that you would

#s36
but oh

#s38
In social changes is that

#s39
uh it seems to me that uh

#s41
Does that

#s42
Y- Yeah

#s43
Like a lot

#s44
it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today You know

#s47
S-

#s49
Yeah

#s50
It 's like people are starting to give up hope

#s51
and they start out very poor

#s52
Let 's see

#s53
that 's a bad tangent to get on

#s54
What else has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties

#s56
No

#s65
Yeah

#s70
Yeah

#s71
It seems so that

#s72
yeah

#s73
that is a pretty big change

#s74
It seems even not just single parent families but with no guidance

#s75
but it seems like some of these even ladies that that 'll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work You know

#s79
well that that I mean that 's very young for a baby

#s84
Yeah

#s87
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s89
Yeah

#s90
I mean they 're going to

#s91
like you said I mean there 's they might be saving money

#s92
I mean even if they had to pay more now I mean in the long run it 's going to cost society more to force two people to work Even though it 's higher productivity is short-term

#s97
Yeah

#s102
Y- yeah

#s104
Oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment

#s108
Huh It

#s109
Yeah

#s110
It 's interesting how w- uh

#s111
home study Is that what you said

#s113
Home school

#s115
Is that uh is is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or

#s118
Oh I s-

#s119
Oh well you sound busy

#s120
So you 're teaching them completely

#s123
Huh

#s128
Yeah

#s132
Yeah

#s133
Yeah

#s134
That 's pretty sad because I mean I do n't know something 's got to change with the schools

#s135
That 's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway

#s137
When they 're young

#s138
Yeah

#s144
Yeah

#s146
Changing people 's expectations
