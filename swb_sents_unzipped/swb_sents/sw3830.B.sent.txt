Hello

#s4
Fine

#s7
Okay

#s8
Let me ask you something

#s9
can I run a minute and shut my radio off

#s11
Okay

#s13
Okay

#s16
Arlington

#s17
Arlington Texas

#s19
Yes

#s21
Yes

#s22
not all good stuff

#s24
No

#s26
No

#s27
I 'm not not personally

#s30
I 'm going to school right now

#s32
I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband 's or what I think

#s35
I 've got a lot of

#s37
Uh-huh

#s40
Yes

#s41
Right

#s42
Yes

#s44
Yes

#s45
I 've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact

#s46
I 'm selling in out now to go to school full time

#s47
and I enjoyed the freedom of having that you know

#s49
go to work when I wanted to or not

#s51
but you know the benefits were n't there

#s53
So

#s55
Oh do you

#s57
Uh-huh

#s59
Uh-huh

#s62
Yeah

#s64
Right

#s65
Yeah

#s66
uh-huh

#s68
I think today the thing that I uh would appreciate the most

#s69
uh because my husband gets his medical through his company

#s70
but we have to pay for mine

#s72
and we 're the only one I 'm the only one that 's being insured

#s73
and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has I mean

#s75
so it 's kind of

#s77
And I would

#s78
I really

#s79
and the way medical expenses are I think that 's probably one of the biggest benefits to ha- you need to have

#s86
Right

#s89
It 's out of sight

#s90
Right

#s91
it 's out of sight

#s93
Even at a group rate I could n't believe how much is our

#s99
Right

#s100
it goes up

#s101
Right

#s104
Uh-huh

#s106
Right

#s108
Right

#s111
Right

#s112
it 's going to hurt the city

#s113
although uh I will personally tell you I used to work at a bank

#s114
and I would see the G M people come in when they were they would shut down to retool

#s116
They were paid that whole time

#s117
and I do n't know if you 're aware of this r-

#s119
Yes

#s120
they come in there

#s121
just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and every Friday and go to the safety deposit box

#s122
and I 'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know

#s123
and And they had all these gr-

#s125
I I really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked

#s128
And right now anybody 's that 's laid off from G M will have a full year 's paycheck

#s129
I just read this in the paper the other day

#s131
Plus probably an additional six months through the the worker 's stuff that they have at at uh through the company

#s132
so I 'm sor- you know I 'm sorry it 's happening because it 's going to hurt

#s134
but I do n't feel as sorry for them

#s136
If my husband were laid off tomorrow we 'd get one more check

#s138
and that would be it

#s141
Yes

#s142
Oh yeah

#s143
that 's already hurting

#s145
But I think there 's a case where benefits have gotten

#s146
they voted them in

#s147
and they got so good I mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know

#s150
and it made the prices of cars go up

#s151
and and you know the

#s153
I we I believe in unions

#s154
but they went too far

#s157
I mean I ca n't make eighteen dollars an hour

#s159
I mean I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
