Oh

#s8
Oh I am after our last summer 's vacation I am antibeach

#s10
Uh-huh

#s11
We went to uh Cape Hatteras

#s13
Well we we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland

#s14
and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days

#s16
And uh uh the the waves were huge

#s17
I 've never quite seen waves like this one

#s19
and uh I was standing in water not more than in barely above my ankles

#s21
and uh you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of

#s22
all of a sudden you 're in sand above your ankles

#s24
And I was standing there talking to my daughter

#s25
and this really big wave came and totally threw me

#s26
and one foot did not come out of the sand

#s27
and it tore the ligaments in my knee

#s29
So I 'm never going to another beach again ever

#s30
I 'm ma-

#s35
Well I I love to go and play around

#s36
At least I always did but although actually my I like the mountains

#s37
I uh I do n't really like hot weather

#s39
that 's my biggest gripe about living here

#s41
And I basically do n't want to go to a hot place on vacation

#s44
Oh

#s45
I my dream vacation is Alaska

#s47
This is just someplace I 've always wanted to go

#s49
and someday I hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
Yeah

#s56
I 'd I 'd like that

#s57
Uh I have n't been to Yellowstone for a long long time

#s59
and I would uh we 've been talking about going there next summer

#s60
Uh I do n't know

#s61
we 'll have to to

#s65
It 's been a long time

#s66
But you know it seems when your family is is different places a lot of trips involved going to visit

#s70
Oh I 'm

#s71
we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from

#s73
And my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here

#s76
And uh we 've got

#s77
one of our our kids lives out on the east coast

#s78
and so we have to you know go to those

#s80
Well I know

#s81
but I 'm tired of them

#s83
I want to go someplace different up there

#s85
Uh my my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with uh money be no object You know so just absolutely you know first class fly where I want to rent a car if I want to Uh you know just the really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says well let 's take this little side trip you know and not have to sit there and figure out um you know again we we fit that in there or not

#s91
And uh that that 's what I um you know that 's what I would like to do

#s92
I have no interest for example in taking a cruise

#s94
To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling

#s97
Yeah

#s99
Uh-huh

#s100
Yeah

#s101
I just uh

#s102
that that does absolutely nothing for me

#s104
But uh I do n't know

#s105
I can say that I think my my favorite spots are still to go to go where there 's mountains and and a lot of trees and and wildlife to view

#s106
and and uh I like that kind of stuff

#s107
I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery

#s113
Uh-huh

#s118
Yeah

#s119
Uh I I guess I 've never really thought about it that way

#s120
Our uh

#s121
we have a daughter who 's almost thirteen

#s122
but she 's uh a very picky eater

#s124
and our our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is you know gee Holly would starve to death if we you know we took her into the country

#s126
so So but I I would like if you know it was anywhere in the world to go I guess even though it 's hot

#s128
I would like to go to Africa
