#s13
Well actually uh I 've I 've had a couple of different situations

#s14
My current one has been the most successful

#s15
Uh at a certain point in life

#s16
an- my husband my ex-husband was an alcoholic

#s17
And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies

#s18
and that left me with three teenagers

#s20
It certainly is

#s21
But at any rate what happened was that I I just absolutely put away all the credit cards

#s22
I did n't rip them up

#s23
I did n't send them back

#s24
Nothing

#s25
I just put them away

#s26
Because there was one that it was really handy to have

#s27
If I absolutely had to have something I could go use it

#s29
But uh mostly we just spent cash Whatever we had

#s30
And if we did n't have it we absolutely did n't spend it

#s31
But then as things improved you know

#s32
Once once I got them all through college uh it came to the point where uh

#s33
my parents came through the depression

#s34
I 'm not sure how old you are

#s37
But my

#s38
Late thirties

#s39
yeah

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
And uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house

#s43
And that 's kind of the way I was raised

#s44
And so I 'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect

#s45
So for quite a period of time I just flat did n't spend any money

#s47
Now meanwhile I got had a a building bank balance

#s48
And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there And not ever have to spend any money on interest

#s51
And that that 's the way I 've operated ever since then

#s52
It

#s53
and you know if if something goes on sale and I do n't have the money I still do n't buy it

#s56
Oh my

#s58
Oh my

#s60
Oh my

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
And that 's the way I do my credit cards now

#s69
Yeah

#s70
I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards

#s72
But it 's the fact that I have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full

#s80
Oh my

#s81
I 'm envious

#s82
Well I

#s84
Uh-huh

#s86
It 's time for you to do these things then Right

#s98
This is so funny

#s99
That 's wonderful

#s100
But you 're lucky to have her because if you 're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it

#s102
I mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not
