#s1
So do you have P C -s

#s6
Uh-huh

#s10
Uh-huh

#s13
Um well I sort of own a computer

#s14
We have two P C -s at home

#s15
but neither one do we really own Um

#s17
No

#s18
both of them are sort of work related

#s19
and

#s21
Yeah

#s22
that 's the nicer way right

#s24
No

#s25
no

#s26
Um I actually I 'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby

#s27
and my husband 's working at Bell Labs

#s28
but he 's really from France

#s29
and these computers actually are from France

#s31
One of them 's a Compaq

#s33
it 's a three eighty-six

#s35
and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible

#s36
it 's a three eighty-six

#s37
I guess it 's twenty-five

#s38
yeah

#s39
three eight six twenty-five C maybe

#s40
I do n't know

#s41
no

#s42
we do n't have the MUMBLEx

#s43
MUMBLEx we decided not to get the MUMBLEx which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing

#s44
and

#s46
Um well I actually do some work working at M I T and at NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington

#s48
and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while

#s50
Um well it depends

#s51
it 's very different in the different places

#s52
but

#s54
Yeah

#s55
yeah

#s56
Program related

#s57
research related

#s58
and I work in the speech field

#s59
and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech

#s61
and I do that type of stuff typically for other people

#s62
and we like here we use the P C -s to do that

#s63
Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that

#s65
Well more uh

#s66
do you know Latek Wo- Word text processing

#s69
so I do n't I do n't use I mean

#s70
you can call it word processing

#s71
but I do n't usually use a word processor to do it

#s73
and we do n't have too much standard software

#s74
Like I have n't bought we have n't really bought any commercially available software at all

#s75
So we do n't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that

#s76
We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or um doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also as a just as a terminal

#s77
and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that

#s79
Uh neither one has a modem

#s80
but we have a modem

#s82
Neither one

#s83
Right

#s85
Yeah

#s86
we have

#s88
Uh-huh

#s90
Uh-huh

#s93
Uh-huh

#s98
So that was it

#s100
Oh I did n't hear it

#s101
Do you hear the the beep in the background

#s103
Oh that 's a an ambulance or something going on here I think

#s106
I have n't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually

#s108
In Manhattan

#s110
Yeah

#s111
I 'm at home

#s113
Uh-huh

#s114
So it 'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean because there 's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear

#s115
So it 'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up

#s116
Um yeah

#s117
and often times that

#s118
I ca n't talk on th- ca n't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud I ca n't even hear the phone call

#s120
Uh about twenty after four

#s123
Okay

#s124
yeah

#s125
we 're Eastern

#s126
And um what did did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems

#s133
Uh-huh

#s138
Uh-huh

#s139
yeah

#s140
I 've never tried using that

#s141
I do n't know too much about it

#s142
What about

#s143
have you did you use commercially available software

#s144
or

#s147
Uh-huh

#s154
Uh-huh

#s156
Uh-huh

#s159
Uh-huh

#s162
I 've never used D Base um

#s163
but I 've heard both good things and bad things about it

#s165
Uh-huh

#s169
Yeah

#s170
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use

#s173
Uh-huh

#s175
Uh-huh

#s176
Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more

#s177
Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days

#s180
But uh

#s181
yeah

#s182
I did n't mean compatible

#s183
I meant comparable

#s184
My brain is going to mush

#s186
And what do you work on at T I

#s188
Uh-huh

#s189
Uh-huh

#s191
Uh-huh

#s193
Uh-huh

#s196
Right
