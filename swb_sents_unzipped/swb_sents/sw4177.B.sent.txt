#s3
Uh actually no

#s4
because because I 'm in school I I kind of miss out on most of the current events

#s5
I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it

#s7
Uh I do n't watch a lot of it

#s8
but that 's the on-

#s9
basically that 's my only major source of information

#s11
What about what about you

#s24
Yeah

#s30
And it 's more in depth

#s37
Yeah

#s39
I know

#s40
where they 're just trying to fill in

#s43
Yeah

#s45
I know

#s46
I do I do too

#s48
Yeah

#s49
you may find one little uh news item interesting

#s50
so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it

#s54
Yeah

#s55
actually y- you mention NEWSWEEK

#s56
I I I do like uh U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT

#s57
I do n't get to read it as much as I like

#s58
but that 's I think that 's a good magazine

#s64
Well right now trying to keep abreast of uh what 's going on in Europe you know with all the U S S R 's satellites breaking off trying to become independent and you know European community coming together

#s66
That 's going to affect our uh economy quite a bit

#s73
Oh yeah

#s75
Yeah

#s77
I 'm I 'm pretty sure it is because uh once once Europe becomes unified and uh their economy becomes one big economy we 're going to be uh kind of hurting

#s82
Yeah

#s83
definitely

#s86
Oh yeah

#s87
so they have a toe hold

#s88
I good toe hold

#s92
Yeah

#s93
because when they first start off they 're going to be highly protectionist

#s94
so

#s96
Yeah

#s99
Yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s106
Yeah

#s107
I I can understand their viewpoint

#s108
they 're just they 're starting off

#s109
their economy 's a little bit weak

#s110
so you want to get established before they com-

#s113
Yeah

#s114
totally

#s117
Actually I 'm not really into sports

#s118
