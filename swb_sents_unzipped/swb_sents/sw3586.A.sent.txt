#s1
I 'm sorry um

#s4
hobbies

#s6
Let me see

#s7
I do n't know if that took or not

#s8
I 'll do it again

#s10
Okay

#s11
What are your hobbies

#s12
I hear you have kids right

#s15
That 's your full time uh hobby right

#s20
Uh-huh

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Um I try to do some painting although I 'm not very good at it

#s26
Well no

#s27
not really

#s30
Yeah

#s31
I I have you know I inherited the genes that make me think I 'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be

#s33
So I always try

#s34
I I do some sewing mostly out of necessity

#s35
Um I 'm making drapes for my house just because I 'm

#s37
Yeah

#s38
well it is n't

#s39
and it is

#s40
It is you know

#s41
actually the sewing is n't the hard part

#s42
it 's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room

#s46
Yeah

#s47
I 've been doing that

#s48
and That

#s50
yeah

#s51
that

#s52
but usually have to do the pleats by hand

#s53
So that at least I can do you know watching T V or whatever

#s55
but

#s58
Yeah

#s59
and I 've I 've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through

#s60
but

#s62
Yeah

#s63
so that 's not really my favorite thing to do or anything

#s64
but I I need to do it

#s67
I have let 's see

#s68
I have a dog and a lot of fish

#s69
Keeping fish I guess is my biggest hobby

#s72
Um yes and no

#s73
It depends on how frequently they die and how much that bothers you

#s77
That 's

#s78
you do n't have to do as much as as I thought

#s79
In fact my problem

#s80
I had fish as a kid

#s81
and they always died immediately

#s83
and what I 'm what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean

#s85
because you have

#s87
Right

#s88
you need to let the bacteria build up

#s89
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance

#s91
And I would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water

#s93
and it would kill all the bacteria

#s94
and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again

#s96
so

#s97
Right

#s98
That 's right

#s99
So now only I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing

#s102
and I do n't try and sterilize things

#s105
That 's right

#s106
That 's right

#s108
Well I 've had them

#s109
I guess it 's been two years now I 've had a a tank here

#s110
and then back at home I used to have a small you know five gallon tank

#s111
But that never worked well

#s112
And I have fifty-five gallons now

#s115
It 's a lot easier

#s117
No

#s119
No

#s120
not yet

#s122
That 's right

#s123
I really do

#s124
But you know

#s127
Yeah

#s128
I just have you know what they call community fish guppies and platies and and basic things

#s130
I do n't get into the

#s132
right

#s133
right

#s134
The expensive ones

#s137
They are

#s138
They 're very expensive

#s139
and you know when you die it 's like when they die it 's more like an investment

#s142
You lost an investment

#s143
so

#s145
No

#s146
not really

#s147
Only if there 's baby fish

#s149
You always have to isolate those

#s152
You get a

#s155
well no

#s156
they have breeders

#s158
It 's a little plastic things that sort of floats

#s160
and you put the mother fish in there

#s161
and then it 's got like a trough underneath her

#s163
so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough

#s164
and there 's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother ca n't get to them either

#s166
And that 's you know

#s167
it kind of works

#s168
but it 's also got slots in it so the water can circulate

#s170
and on occasion if you get a real small one it 'll fit out the slots

#s172
That 's right

#s173
so But you know it works I guess

#s176
Oh they 'll eat them

#s178
Yeah

#s180
Yes

#s182
It and it 's funny because the one I have every single month without fail she has babies

#s184
Oh no

#s185
All the time

#s186
and um I

#s187
and she 's supposed to

#s188
her variety it says they wo n't eat the babies

#s189
and I 've seen her do it

#s190
So

#s192
Oh it 's ter-

#s193
well it makes you understand that you know things are different

#s195
We might right We might decide what 's proper and what is n't

#s196
but you know that 's the way it is for them

#s199
Yeah

#s200
That 's it

#s202
Yes

#s203
because if the baby is strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide

#s207
So

#s208
Yeah

#s209
Yeah

#s210
yeah

#s212
No

#s213
not really

#s214
I I try

#s215
I also I play a couple of instruments
