#s2
Okay

#s4
Yeah

#s5
yeah

#s6
Well first of all I I ha- have to ask you how how old you are

#s8
Twenty-seven

#s9
okay

#s10
Well I am quite a bit older than you are

#s11
But no

#s12
I think exercise is extremely important

#s13
and I I do exercise on a regular basis

#s16
Well I do uh jazzercise which is an aerobic uh program that

#s18
are you familiar with it

#s20
It 's uh you know a national company

#s21
and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long

#s22
so you can

#s25
No

#s26
it 's really it 's an aerobic routine

#s27
Yo- you warm up

#s28
and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate

#s29
and then you gradually go down again

#s32
No

#s33
I only do it probably two or three times a week

#s35
The minimum they want you to do is three times a week

#s38
Well it 's really a

#s39
I mean it 's called a center

#s40
and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time

#s41
and then you just go in whenever you can

#s42
So like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning

#s43
or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings

#s46
No

#s47
I go by myself

#s48
and that 's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me

#s50
and most of my friends that are my age do n't exercise

#s51
or they might play tennis

#s53
and since I am not a tennis player uh you know I do n't get that

#s54
but I am you know I am between I am in my late forties

#s56
so uh there are n't many people you know that want to do that

#s58
Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers You know with with children between the ages

#s61
Young mothers

#s62
You know young women with small children are the ones that I find

#s64
Well what do you do

#s69
Oh great

#s70
Yeah

#s71
Do you play every day

#s75
Well now who do you play with

#s76
Do you have friends that play with you

#s77
or just

#s80
Yeah

#s88
Well see that 's that 's th- really good

#s89
and I think that keeps a lot some people from exercising

#s91
I mean I do n't have a problem with weight either

#s92
but I think I do n't have a problem because I exercise You know

#s94
I mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin

#s95
and it 's because I exercise

#s97
but I also watch what I eat You know

#s99
but you 'll come

#s100
being twenty-seven you do n't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet

#s103
but as you get older you will

#s106
Well it might not

#s107
Mine

#s108
because everybody 's been telling me that too

#s109
and so far it has n't happened you know

#s110
and I I just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high

#s115
Yeah

#s116
But you do n't play any other sports but basketball

#s121
But do you ski

#s122
Being in Utah I was wondering if you ski

#s126
Oh did it really

#s128
Cause I know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great

#s131
Yeah

#s134
Yeah

#s135
Well I have never skied before

#s136
but I have friends that go to Utah all the time

#s137
and they think it 's really

#s139
and they ski

#s140
I guess there 's a place where you can ski

#s141
well is it Tahoe Where you ski from

#s142
no

#s143
that 's Nevada to California I guess

#s146
Yeah

#s147
I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line

#s150
But there 's a fun- there is a place in Utah called a funny name

#s152
But it 's like Oh Heavenly

#s153
Is that it

#s155
Yeah

#s156
I think it 's called Heavenly

#s158
You 've never heard of that

#s160
Well maybe it is n't in Utah

#s161
But they said they 've skied Heavenly

#s162
and it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place

#s163
It 's kind of funny

#s167
Oh yeah

#s168
You can get really sore

#s169
I know you

#s170
I mean I 've talked to people

#s171
but most of these people ski enough so that they do n't get sore

#s175
And then is it your quadriceps that are the worst

#s177
In your legs and

#s179
Yeah

#s180
Yeah

#s183
Well

#s184
and it 's strange that you can do

#s185
like I did aerobics you know all the time

#s186
and then I went horseback riding

#s187
and still I was so sore

#s188
and I could n't get over
