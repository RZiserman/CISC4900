We 're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis

#s2
and probably the first question would be whether you 've ever had to go through that process

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
So it was pretty much a physical decision

#s15
Um

#s17
Yeah

#s19
My husband 's family are reaching that point

#s20
but it 's it 's so difficult

#s21
Was she in favor of it

#s22
or or was she kind of opposed to it

#s27
Uh-huh

#s32
Yeah

#s39
So often I think though elderly people do n't realize that their diet is that bad

#s40
I work with a lot of elderly people

#s41
I 'm a trust officer

#s43
and so often they think they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating very much or very balanced meals

#s47
Yes

#s48
Well you know that 's part of the aging process That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste

#s50
It really is

#s52
Yeah

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
Yeah

#s59
And the portions

#s60
people do n't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals

#s61
I do that right now

#s63
and I 'm not near nursing home age

#s65
Yeah

#s66
Uh-huh

#s67
So as a family you all just visited nursing homes

#s68
or probably in College Station there was n't a whole lot of choice

#s73
Uh-huh

#s79
Uh-huh

#s81
Uh-huh

#s84
Oh yeah

#s85
That 's a given

#s88
Uh-huh

#s89
And sometimes the the help there does it I think

#s92
Uh-huh

#s95
Uh-huh

#s100
Adapt

#s103
Yeah

#s104
I as I think I mentioned I was in the trust business

#s105
and I 've seen so many elderly people

#s106
Usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you 're financially if if you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money

#s107
but the the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting

#s109
They 're able to move in while they 're still independent and still social

#s111
and and they do group things

#s112
And then if health or or mental capacity deteriorates they 're able to take the next steps without so much change

#s113
and oh I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they 've always been in

#s114
It 's really kind of difficult

#s122
Yeah

#s126
Uh-huh

#s131
Well and it 's the first step in in actually accepting that you are failing and and aging

#s133
You know once you make that step you know that it 's just going to be downhill from then on

#s134
and and I 've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change

#s136
They they became

#s137
in fact that 's probably what 's going to happen with my husband 's mother

#s138
She 's going to endanger herself before she 'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision

#s139
And that scares me the the thought of forcing somebody to do something

#s143
Yeah

#s146
Uh-huh

#s150
Not as independence

#s152
Yeah

#s154
Uh-huh

#s155
Uh-huh

#s160
Yeah

#s161
And the quality of life really is n't there

#s163
Oh it 's tough

#s164
it really is

#s167
Uh-huh

#s169
Well they fear being dependent on somebody

#s171
They they fear being a burden to to family members

#s173
My husband 's mother will have major surgery

#s174
and we 'll find out about it in a casual conversation

#s175
She 'll let something slip

#s176
and we 'll say wait a minute

#s177
And and that 's it

#s178
she just well

#s179
I did n't want to bother you

#s180
She ca n't accept that we want to be the care givers

#s182
Yeah

#s183
Well she stayed she stayed in a temporary nursing home Until she was okay

#s185
You know it 's just

#s186
but it 's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her

#s187
She 's down in Temple

#s189
and we ca n't see her often enough to really know what 's going on

#s191
So it 's difficult

#s192
it really is

#s193
and we 're all heading that way

#s194
and

#s200
Uh-huh

#s202
Yeah
