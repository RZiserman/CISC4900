#s1
Well uh I do n't know

#s2
I think the budget is really out of hand right now

#s3
and especially in this election year I think that uh there ought to be so- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this

#s7
Right

#s8
Right

#s9
and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts

#s10
Uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering

#s13
Yeah

#s14
ninety-seven cents a week

#s15
Now what

#s16
that 's really not going to do a lot of good it does n't seem to me to your average middle income person you know

#s18
Another ninety-seven cents

#s19
hell you can buy a coke or something for that

#s23
Yeah

#s26
That ninety-seven cents really is n't going to do it for me either

#s28
Uh I I have n't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either

#s29
especially the Democratic candidates do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point

#s33
I believe it was Dukakis

#s36
but I I ca n't

#s38
Yeah

#s39
I mean that 's better than George Bush who came out and said No

#s40
I will not

#s42
read my lips or whatever

#s43
and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know I I ca n't follow through on this

#s46
But it seems to me that uh that the budget is so out of hand

#s47
and especially now that they say Okay the cold war is over

#s48
and we 're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year

#s50
Well I 'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go

#s51
because in my opinion I do n't think I 'm ever going to see any of this peace so-called peace dividend

#s55
I mean if they could actually put something together and make

#s56
I 'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because I feel that they waste money also

#s58
but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever

#s62
Right

#s63
ex- Exactly

#s66
and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country

#s70
Yeah

#s71
and and there 's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we 're in right now unless at least I feel unless we focus on the infra structure

#s72
and I surely do n't hear anybody saying that right now

#s79
So am I

#s82
Uh I U

#s85
Uh-huh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
Right

#s95
Right

#s97
Uh-huh

#s98
Right

#s100
You you just have to wonder what they 're thinking in Washington

#s102
Yeah

#s103
uh well it 's it 's more than a loaded

#s104
it 's a loaded cannon

#s105
I mean they 've got trillions of dollars to spend every year

#s107
and they in my opinion do n't do a very responsible job of spending that money

#s111
Oh no

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
For for the moment

#s115
and that 's what really is getting me about what George Bush 's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you 'll be happy come November and you 'll elect me again

#s118
and then I 'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said

#s120
or you know it does n't seem that it 's going to make much of a difference

#s125
No

#s126
no

#s127
not at all

#s129
No
