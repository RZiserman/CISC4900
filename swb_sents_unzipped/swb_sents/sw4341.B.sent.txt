Well I think that in some cases it is warranted

#s15
And I do n't

#s16
I think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not

#s21
I mean I mean I 'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer

#s23
or

#s25
Well for some things

#s27
I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood

#s31
I mean you ca n't guarantee that they would n't escape from prison and do it again

#s35
And I do n't think that that rehabilitation is effective

#s44
But then you know I think that that some murderers do n't really warrant capital punishment You know just like for example uh you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them

#s49
and I do n't think that would really warrant capital punishment

#s54
Uh it is to a certain extent

#s56
but I think

#s57
I do n't know because

#s60
I think in s-

#s61
and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available

#s73
Well I think that would be kind of drastic punishment

#s75
And

#s78
But one thing I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance sh- should be investigated

#s81
But like I said if if someone is is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society

#s89
But

#s92
And a lot of people that are a danger to society that are n't in prison

#s101
Well I know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment

#s103
And I 'm in I 'm from South Carolina
