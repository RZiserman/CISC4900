I 'm Nevin from Sunnyvale California

#s5
Pretty good

#s8
Yep

#s10
Okay

#s12
Well I definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous

#s16
It 's probably the safest thing

#s19
Yep

#s21
No

#s22
And even like you know two-thirds majority I mean it 's

#s27
Yep

#s30
Yeah

#s34
Yeah

#s35
Like Gives them a little too much power

#s40
Plus you know you may be you know doing you know a a guilty verdict

#s41
but it may not be you know it may be for technical reasons

#s44
Yeah

#s47
I know MUMBLEx

#s50
Yeah

#s51
It

#s52
there would be much more of that

#s56
No

#s57
But I I tend to follow it just to just to know what 's going on

#s63
Yeah

#s64
I do too

#s65
so

#s68
No

#s70
Yeah

#s71
I know a little more about civil cases when than criminal cases Which is

#s73
it 's more in how you present it versus you know who 's right

#s76
Yep

#s80
I know

#s82
When I was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and

#s84
like you know you go say okay we ca n't bring up this point because then they 're going to you know

#s85
the opposition will say this this and this and

#s88
Yep

#s90
And it 's like the the truth is n't really important anymore

#s91
It 's

#s95
Yep

#s100
That sounds like a little abuse of our system

#s101
but

#s103
Yeah

#s104
but it 's for the more general

#s105
people do n't want to take responsibility

#s107
You know it 's

#s109
Yep

#s112
Uh yeah

#s113
Well originally from Chicago

#s114
but

#s119
I really

#s123
Uh-huh

#s124
Yeah

#s127
Yeah

#s128
I have n't either other than

#s133
Yeah

#s134
I 'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better

#s135
MUMBLEx

#s141
I know

#s143
Yeah

#s144
And if it 's criminal cases we you ca n't put them in jail because there 's no room left

#s149
Yeah

#s152
Huh

#s154
Not at all
