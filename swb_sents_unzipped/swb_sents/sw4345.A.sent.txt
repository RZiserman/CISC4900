No

#s8
we do n't have the uh national public radio in in my area

#s10
I can hear it at the uh uh oh the college town nearby when I 'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away

#s11
but the F M signal does n't reach this far

#s13
Uh I 'll listen to shortwave quite a bit

#s14
It gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin

#s16
Uh I agree with you too on the uh uh the cable channel C N N and HEADLINE NEWS

#s17
Uh I 'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why I rely on shortwave and and then the cable cable C N N

#s22
I think a lot of it is just uh the fact that in the U S you 're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts

#s23
or or it 's not happening in your backyard

#s25
so it 's it 's more of a it 's not as a personal uh

#s26
the news is n't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what 's on shortwave

#s27
It 's B B C is uh oh I do n't know the right word is is almost uh

#s28
they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it

#s30
and it just

#s31
they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions

#s33
Uh very much so

#s34
very much so

#s35
and I I think a lot of it is uh especially T V news

#s36
they do n't really have the time and a lot of them do n't have the education and the background to uh oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it

#s37
I mean I you know I think it 's important to interpret it

#s38
but a lot of times the person does n't have the experience to to do the interpreting

#s42
Oh I like the straight reporting

#s43
Uh and then I I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it

#s44
It 's it 's nice to hear someone 's interpretation of it

#s46
uh I always think it 's humorous when when the President gives the State of the Union and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard

#s47
And a lot of time I do n't hear exactly what they what they write into it

#s49
So I overall I think I would rather hear just straight reporting

#s56
Yeah

#s57
I I think people are people have that opinion

#s58
They they want to sit down in front of the TV and uh or at a read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every-
