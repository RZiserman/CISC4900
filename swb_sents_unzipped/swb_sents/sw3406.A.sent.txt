So what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution

#s6
Uh-huh

#s11
Yeah

#s12
I uh I

#s13
it 's hard to put the finger on uh what 's worse you know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion um with uh your hydrocarbons uh causing the damage in which

#s17
Well I notice on one of these uh home shopping networks they were selling these uh halogen uh fire extinguishers

#s19
and the halogen is uh an ozone depleter

#s20
and it got hydrocarbons in there

#s21
It 's a very clean uh fire extinguisher

#s22
but it 's you know really bad on the environment

#s28
Yeah

#s31
Yeah

#s33
I know

#s34
uh in the Twin Cities area

#s35
I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right

#s36
but they had a new policy where in order to get your uh your license uh your car license uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards

#s38
and uh

#s44
Yeah

#s45
Yeah uh

#s46
yeah

#s47
I guess that was just mainly in the cities there

#s48
and as far as where I live I do n't have to do that

#s49
but I have an old car which I doubt would uh would uh pass the inspection a seventy-six

#s51
and uh you know there 's no way I would put in a lot of money to to repair it to meet standards

#s54
Yeah

#s55
So although I do what I can to to cut down pollution

#s56
but uh

#s58
Yeah

#s61
Yeah

#s65
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s79
Yeah

#s83
Yeah

#s87
Yeah

#s89
Yeah

#s90
well well around here I we get uh

#s91
well it depends you know

#s92
either in the in the winter time it it blows it your way

#s93
and in the summer time we probably get yours

#s103
Yeah

#s107
Yeah

#s108
well it uh

#s109
th- that 's a big thing too

#s110
I know it has nothing to do with air pollution

#s111
but I kind of look at the way people treat our
