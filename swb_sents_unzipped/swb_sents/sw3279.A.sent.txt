Okay

#s2
I 've got a you know

#s3
I have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing

#s4
and then that 's get half of the government rid of the half of the government payroll

#s7
Not all

#s8
I you know I do n't know if you 've ever been to Washington D C

#s11
Uh you you 've seen that which was on there and the offices

#s12
and in light of these uh hearings we 've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed

#s14
They really do n't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses at in their own business of what they 're doing

#s16
And the other thing is uh besides that I think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid

#s17
I have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us

#s19
I find that a total waste and part of the defense budget

#s20
Uh again being just a voter and a taxpayer you know working through our congressman I do n't think there 's too much that I 'm going to be able to do about it

#s21
but I believe in taking an active part in politics

#s22
so

#s27
Uh-huh

#s29
Right

#s34
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s38
they do n't they do n't seem to

#s39
well I really think the biggest problem

#s40
and then the Taft-Rudman Act is supposed to help that

#s41
The biggest part is they have no accountability for what they 're doing

#s43
I mean this nonsense that 's coming through now about uh uh lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order t- to boost the economy because people have n- more money as it 's gets it 's ridiculous

#s45
If they do n't have that money now bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government

#s49
No

#s50
Yeah

#s51
and thank God we do n't operate our budget the way they operate theirs

#s52
or we 'd all be in in dire trouble

#s54
But that 's uh

#s55
yeah

#s56
I do n't know what we 're going to be able to do about it

#s57
but I guess it 's sitting around so long that it 's sort of like our mortgages

#s58
I do n't ever expect to pay mine off before I die

#s59
so I guess why should the government

#s60
Is n't

#s61
that 's the way they 're thinking these days anyway

#s66
I I do n't think it ever will really

#s67
I

#s68
maybe if they ever get to the point

#s69
the biggest you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense

#s71
Really

#s72
If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic you know inter- intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might

#s74
I I believe in paying my share

#s75
and I do n't mind uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to

#s76
But I just I just sometimes feel like I 'm being used

#s77
But uh again I do n't think we 'll be able to do anything about it

#s78
so

#s83
Yeah

#s84
Bite the bullet

#s85
It sounds like you have a baby there

#s88
Uh-huh

#s91
Oh really

#s93
Oh that 's a shame

#s94
She 's not the one going to Washington huh

#s98
Oh

#s100
Okay

#s101
Okay Geri

#s102
We 've probably been on long enough

#s104
They did n't cut us off

#s105
but I think that will probably do it

#s106
so it was nice talking to you

#s109
Okey-doke

#s111
Bye-bye
