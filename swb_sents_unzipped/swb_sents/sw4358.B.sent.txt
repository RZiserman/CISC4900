Uh basically they 're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup

#s10
Well here they and

#s11
uh live in an apartment complex

#s13
And they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters

#s14
So a lot of the people who live up front do n't bother to recycle because you know it 's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins

#s26
Right

#s27
They Th- here they 're trying to push through a bill

#s29
and a lot of people are against it

#s30
And it 's going to create a lot more work for the uh the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff

#s31
Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything

#s42
Right

#s43
I think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate

#s55
Uh I know uh I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books

#s56
Uh usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones

#s57
Usually just get dumped out with the trash

#s58
And phone books are a large volume of annual trash

#s67
Well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper

#s69
They contain the glue and stuff

#s70
and they used to have to take out all the uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them

#s72
Now I think they 've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
