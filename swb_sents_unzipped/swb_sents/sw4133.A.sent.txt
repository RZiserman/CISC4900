#s1
So uh you know my feeling is that uh it 's really being used today

#s2
it it you know it it really is n't doing any real good purpose for anything because it 's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal

#s5
Right

#s6
because y- you you 've got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses

#s8
Uh and you know it certainly does n't seem to be a deterrent Uh for one thing because it 's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly do n't think the people that are committing the c- crimes that would be eligible you know really care

#s13
Right

#s14
I mean it 's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know

#s15
I 'm invulnerable

#s16
I do n't need to care about this

#s17
You know I I I 'm never going to get caught

#s25
Yeah

#s26
one one way or another

#s28
Yeah

#s29
but but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there 's a chance that he might do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself

#s33
Well You know so that you know

#s34
the the question is you know the other qu- problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent you know

#s35
There are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops I 'm sorry

#s36
guess we killed the wrong guy

#s41
Right

#s42
you you can apologize nicely

#s43
but you know you know I think you know the the price you know

#s44
it I 've heard quotes you know it 's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned I think i- is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works

#s49
Yeah

#s50
and you know the I I think that you know

#s51
and the way it 's being used now it 's like you listen to Bush is you know

#s52
well where are we going to impose d- you know

#s53
it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in

#s54
Tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer

#s56
And again I do n't thing these people care

#s57
They risk their lives every day

#s60


#
Yeah

#s62
and and you know uh especially now I live in in Massachusetts you know

#s63
w- w- we 're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something

#s65
So you know

#s66
but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like Texas or someplace that does you know it it it 's impossible to make a case that it 's it 's affecting it in any way

#s68
I think it 's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it

#s71
Because you know

#s75
Oh yeah

#s76
it 's mainl- lot of blacks

#s77
Also a lot of young people

#s78
You know a a a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I 've seen

#s80
And you know I I think when you listen to like the uh the the victims ' families and things they 're always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like they 've gotten something out of it

#s81
I mean my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it should n't make any difference to the uh the victim 's family

#s82
The only thing that should really

#s83
I mean obviously if someone of mine who has close died I 'd probably feel differently

#s84
but you know th- you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society

#s89
Right

#s90
I mean the

#s93
Right

#s94
and the the other thing is that you know

#s95
I was reading through a book on uh geneo human geneo research

#s97
and there more and more things like schizophrenia

#s98
and why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin

#s100
So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say well the problem is you you 've got an endorphin imbalance

#s101
and you know if you take this regularly you 'll be a sane and productive member of society you know

#s103
you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions

#s107
Society made me do it

#s108
Yeah
