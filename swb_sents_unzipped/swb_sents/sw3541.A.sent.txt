Okay

#s2
You think you 're getting your money 's worth

#s5
Well that 's probably the next year 's agenda

#s9
Oh yeah

#s10
They 're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around

#s11
and I I think one way or the other we 're going to pay for the bureaucracy I guess

#s12
Uh it 's one area that is really I I think hurting the economy more than anything

#s13
I think the taxes have just every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products

#s14
and I I I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now

#s17
That 's right

#s18
That 's right

#s20
Yep

#s21
that 's right

#s25
Well I think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is it 's an unfair tax across the board uh as far as ability to pay which a- allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards

#s26
But uh now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy

#s27
and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they are n't going to be paying taxes on you know

#s28
And uh that 's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue

#s29
but I do n't think it is anymore

#s30
not in Texas anyway

#s33
That 's right

#s34
that 's right

#s37
That 's right

#s38
that 's right

#s39
And that 's the unfairness of the thing

#s40
but uh I think taxes generally are unfair

#s41
so

#s43
Well you know like other things if they do n't affect you you do n't worry about them too much

#s44
I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still

#s45
so it does n't

#s46
I I think uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know

#s48
And uh I guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh that 's their prerogative you know

#s49
I I I do n't have a whole of sympathy on that

#s50
You maybe you buy that you know

#s51
and I do n't mean to be knocking uh

#s57
Yeah

#s58
there are

#s59
there are

#s60
And the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that I guess you know unless they really want it

#s61
buy something that you know more

#s62
well it it 's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know

#s63
It 's a way of increasing the population

#s64
that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes

#s66
And where you exempt things like uh uh

#s67
one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards

#s70
Now I do n't know if that 's true or not

#s71
but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know a- any kind of interest that you 're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers

#s73
So that 's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they do n't you know to a degree

#s74
well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze

#s75
it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you know

#s76
They quit buying it
