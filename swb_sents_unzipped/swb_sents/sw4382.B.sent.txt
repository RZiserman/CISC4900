Huh

#s6
Well here in Seattle uh it 's g- the air 's getting more and more polluted

#s7
We 're uh we 're in kind of a basin

#s8
And uh Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains

#s9
And uh there 's been a lot a lot of growth population growth around here

#s10
And uh it 's uh it 's getting worse

#s11
I think most of it is from cars

#s17
Uh-huh

#s21
Oh

#s25
Yeah

#s26
Yeah

#s27
I live in the university district

#s28
and uh uh it 's supposed to have about the worst air pollution

#s29
I think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school

#s31
And then we 're right next to Interstate Five also

#s35
Oh yeah

#s36
MUMBLEx have they started doing that yet

#s41
We have that here

#s42
and uh they 're they 're expanding it to uh more counties here Uh as the population spreads out

#s43
and I think they 're also going to be making it uh mandatory for more cars

#s44
Th- th- there was uh something in the law about if your car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you did n't have to get it done anymore

#s45
And I think they 're eliminating that uh that loophole

#s49
Yeah

#s53
Oh really

#s54
You mean they could do that remotely

#s63
Huh

#s65
Now where does the source light go

#s68
Oh I see

#s73
Jeez

#s75
Yeah

#s76
That 's neat

#s77
But it 's also been uh oh you know

#s78
everybody is talking about using more mass transient here

#s79
but it uh it 's tough you know

#s80
Like I 've I 've looked into riding the bus to work

#s81
and I can drive to work in uh and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges

#s83
But if I uh if I take the bus it requires several transfers

#s84
and it takes over an hour

#s86
So so it it 's it 's not hard to see why why I keep driving

#s89
And you know I feel guilty cause I 'm driving a
