We 're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it

#s5
They 're usually pretty broad anyway

#s7
Where do you live

#s9
Okay

#s10
so a

#s12
I 'm in Richardson

#s13
so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at uh Maceo High School in Dallas

#s18
It is you know

#s20
No

#s21
mine are already in college now

#s22
so I do n't have to

#s24
at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages

#s31
That 's true

#s37
Yeah

#s38
well I just I just do n't understand how of course in my little world how guns could be so available

#s44
Oh my heavens

#s49
Well maybe that 's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution

#s51
You know because I do n't

#s52
now I somehow I feel we 're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen you know across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped

#s53
and people do n't do anything

#s55
A woman was raped in Richardson I read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now

#s56
And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help

#s58
But nobody nobody did anything

#s60
You know I mean they heard someone calling for help

#s61
Nobody even called the police to say you know I hear a strange screaming

#s63
I 'm afraid you know if you

#s64
I do n't blame people with today 's society about going out to help themselves

#s68
Yeah

#s70
I just you know

#s71
it 's it 's really frightening that we 're not we 're trying to live in our own little cocoons

#s72
and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention

#s80
Yes

#s82
Yeah

#s83
well you know the call for help is what scares me now because it it just

#s84
I do n't know

#s85
people just do n't

#s86
I do n't know

#s87
I ca n't say they do n't care because people just have to care about another person

#s89
But it 's that not getting involved that impersonal society I think we live in today

#s93
Yeah

#s95
Let me ask you

#s96
getting back to your son 's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police are n't doing

#s97
he did n't have a license for the gun correct

#s102
Uh-huh
