Hi Ed

#s3
Hi

#s9
Oh

#s15
Who wrote that

#s20
Huh

#s29
I see

#s32
Well that is interesting

#s33
Right

#s36
That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that

#s41


#
And they have not made a movie of the week of it yet

#s47
Yeah

#s55
Uh

#s56
Explained MUMBLEx

#s63
Supposedly scooped up by the triangle

#s66
Yeah

#s72
Yeah

#s73
On that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the Amelia Earhart story whatever happened with her

#s76
I I think that would be

#s77
I am sure there is something out there uh MUMBLEx

#s81
I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years

#s83
Well whatever

#s84
this is one aspect of it

#s86
Of course you know it is so weird

#s87
cause no one will ever really know

#s88
it 's it tha-

#s89
so but it 's entertaining

#s90
and it makes you think about things

#s92
That is for sure

#s96
Yeah

#s100
Right

#s101
Well I I guess I just have not read anyth-

#s102
I mean usually I just if I find a good book I will sit you know for two days until it is finished If it 's that good

#s104
and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow 's

#s105
and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT

#s107
And I just really really liked the way he writes

#s108
It 's just incredible

#s113
Yeah

#s118
Uh

#s123
That was good I think

#s125
And and the other book I am trying to think you know like was in the last year

#s126
and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY uh

#s128
BON

#s129
yeah

#s131
Uh

#s132
Yeah

#s133
I

#s134
that was really really good

#s135
the movie was nothing compared to the book

#s138
And

#s139
Yeah

#s142
Oh the movie was a joke compared to

#s143
I mean because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing uh so- so- society 's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things

#s146
and and so it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie

#s149
And anyway we are not talking about that

#s150
but uh gee I just I like to read gardening books and things like that Just to tell me what to do with my garden

#s151
and uh And uh

#s157
Yeah

#s161
Like what is a book on your list

#s162
you know I have a list too

#s163
and I have never gotten to it

#s173
Oh
