Do you ever think that there 's a crime that 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just does n't deserve to live anymore

#s6
Uh-huh

#s9
Of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um I I like the statement made by Cuomo

#s10
Cuomo I believe is

#s11
um he 's he 's governor of New York

#s12
but uh he 's uh against the death penalty

#s13
But um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife

#s14
And that 's

#s15
but but even even in that circumstan- in that uh uh situation he would b- he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh keep him from doing the doing the things

#s17
Right

#s18
exactly

#s21
Uh-huh

#s23
Yeah

#s25
See I do n't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do

#s26
Are they reformatories where we 're trying to take people who ca n't survive or or that that are n't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together

#s27
Or are they

#s28
is it a penal institution

#s29
Is it is is it designed for punishment

#s30
Um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you 're trying to punishment

#s31
Uh perhaps not in the manner that we do it

#s32
but but it in in theory it fits in

#s33
In reforma- system in a reformatory I mean

#s34
if you if you put someone to death you obviously ca n't reform them

#s36
So

#s43
Yeah

#s44
I do n't think it 's done

#s45
I do n't think we run it as a deterrent

#s46
I mean people say that

#s47
but I mean if it was really a deterrent I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while

#s49
And if we really w- if it was really seriously going to be a d- deterrent I would think that it would be public

#s50
I mean I do n't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it

#s51
If someone ever

#s52
if you know

#s53
like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by a firing squad or something like that

#s54
I would think you 'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there 's there 's protestors out here at the you know
