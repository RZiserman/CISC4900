#s2
Yes

#s3
I do

#s5
China painting and ceramics

#s7
I enjoy it

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
I enjoy the china more

#s12
And now that I have my eyes corrected to the point that I can see the delicate part of china painting I do enjoy it

#s15
My husband kept begging me

#s16
and he 's been dead now for twenty years

#s17
so you understand that this was a long time ago

#s18
But he finally brought me the china the book the brushes

#s19
and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons

#s22
And I said I 'll do it for three months

#s23
and if I do n't like it that 's it

#s24
Well I painted an awful lot until his death which was several years

#s25
And it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable self-satisfying thing I 've had

#s26
I

#s30
I have sold quite a bit

#s31
I give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home

#s32
and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it

#s33
Uh-huh

#s36
I have just retired

#s38
Yes

#s40
No

#s41
it 's not

#s43
It 's a great hobby

#s44
but do n't retire

#s46
Oh

#s50
Oh have

#s51
well

#s57
Wow

#s63
Oh uh-huh

#s65
Well my sister is the seamstress of the two of us

#s66
And but she does n't china paint

#s67
so we both have our expertise side

#s69
What part of Ohio are you in

#s76
Oh what 's

#s80
If you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can I mean a large flat plate

#s81
Um that way you can get the feel of

#s82
you 're not cramped on these smaller objects

#s85
That 's right

#s87
In Abilene Texas

#s89
She just taught china painting

#s90
Uh-huh

#s91
and

#s93
Then then we had so much fun there

#s94
I had a friend from Albany which is about thirty-six miles away

#s95
and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor 's home because she did our firing for us

#s96
and she would help us

#s97
and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies

#s98
and it was just such a delightful time

#s99
And then after I

#s102
Beg pardon

#s104
I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband 's death

#s105
So I have put it aside for a little while

#s106
but I 'm I have just found me an instructor to get started again

#s107
uh-huh

#s110
Uh-huh

#s111
Of course I just have one beautiful p- with peonies uh umbrella stand

#s112
and I have two daughters

#s113
and they 're both
