#s1
What

#s2
Do you want to start

#s6
Right

#s7
You are right

#s8
Yeah

#s9
I I suppose I should have

#s12
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh yeah

#s14
uh I uh I guess I I hate to see anyone die uh

#s16
but uh I guess these people that go around and and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse uh I do n't think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Yeah

#s32
Yeah

#s36
Well and even even that I do n't really know if that would help

#s37
I think a lot of these people do it uh mainly because of of T V

#s38
and a-

#s40
the double reason ma-

#s41
they they see it being done on T V

#s42
and also the fact of of notoriety

#s43
I mean they become well known

#s44
They are almost like like a big star

#s47
Yeah

#s49
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s55
Right

#s58
Yeah

#s59
Well I I I think if they went according to uh the BIBLE where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life

#s62
uh you take a life you give yours

#s64
Uh uh that 's for sure

#s65
there 's exceptions to the rule

#s66
I mean if if it 's an accidental taking then uh you look at that

#s67
but you know most of these people that down right go right and and do it out of pure pleasure uh I do n't uh like to see that

#s69
I guess also the fact that they say it 's not a deterrent

#s70
it is a deterrent in the in the sense that that person will never do it again

#s73
Not not not if he 's killed he ca n't do it again

#s80
The death penalty

#s81
Uh-huh

#s84
Right

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
yeah

#s88
Well I I guess I 'm also looking at beyond even that

#s89
I I I guess I been thinking about it

#s90
and I do n't have a definite opinion

#s91
but uh repeat uh crimes uh maybe not the the more mild ones but you know a more severe ones especially on on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but beating them half to death

#s95
Just for pleasure too

#s96
and I guess you 've got to look at something like that

#s98
Do they deserve to uh remain on this earth too

#s102
Right

#s105
Right

#s108
Yeah

#s109
Uh-huh
