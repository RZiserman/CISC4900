#s3
Okay

#s4
So are you a a a golfer

#s5
or are you a spectator

#s9
Well I 'm the same way

#s10
I I go out there and hit the ball

#s13
Yeah

#s15
Um uh well in the Carolinas it 's it 's just you know we 've got a bunch of golf courses around here

#s21
Uh well I mean I 'm not a serious golfer at all

#s22
uh uh a friend of mine goes golfing a lot

#s23
and he drags me out every now and then

#s24
and I uh I do n't have a I do n't really even have a game

#s25
I usually

#s26
when I go out and play golf it 's usually like at a at one of these par threes that you know you

#s28
but um I like watching it on T V

#s31
Uh Well I I I if I can I can hit a great deal like um they they my friends

#s39
to get me they they say I hit worm burners because I I ca n't hit it up in the air

#s41
So I 'm pretty bad

#s42
but I I I get great distance hitting it you know MUMBLEx across the ground

#s43
and if it 's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I 'm

#s44
but I 'm getting better

#s45
I 've got where now I can hit it in in the air some of the time

#s47
Yeah

#s48
Uh so I 'm kind of a novice at it

#s57
Well that I I guess that 's what I need to do is is get some kind of lessons or something

#s58
Because I my my tee off is not bad

#s59
I mean I 'm I 'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that

#s60
it 's just that that initial tee

#s69
Just walking around the hollow and making sure there 's not really

#s70
you know checking the ground and and so forth you know

#s72
See how it 's going to break or whatever

#s74
Yeah

#s76
If you get if you get down on the ground you really can

#s78
Um well if you know if it 's up on a slope that you 've got to hit it not kill it

#s79
but you 've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it 's it 's you know

#s80
because when it 's going up a hill it 's going to break in a direction

#s83
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s90
Yeah

#s93
But I

#s95
The the

#s96
it 's it 's like I said

#s97
once I get up on the green I 'm fine

#s98
but that that tee shot uh it you know

#s99
when teeing off i- I 'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground

#s100
so it it takes me awhile to get to the hole

#s101
but

#s103
I 'm all set

#s107
that sounds good to me

#s113
Well it it it usually takes me about probably two two or three to get it there

#s114
and and then that 's according to the hole

#s115
and it ju-

#s116
uh uh maybe one or two putts

#s117
It 's according to where I 'm at on the green

#s120
But the friends I play with uh they play all the time

#s121
and and they 're really good

#s123
Uh they 're not Joe Pros

#s124
but they they golf in the high sixties low seventies

#s125
so I guess they 're pretty good

#s128
Yeah

#s129
For eighteen

#s132
Yeah

#s135
No

#s136
no

#s137
no

#s138
that 's not my golf

#s139
That 's my friends

#s140
Mine mine

#s141
I 'm I 'm usually in the eighties or nineties

#s142
so I 'm I 'm not good

#s148
Well I either teeing off I either slice it or I hook it ever single time

#s149
and and I alternate
