#s1
So what do you think about it

#s3
Right

#s4
Yeah

#s5
I guess that 's so

#s7
Um uh I think there 's some problems

#s8
but they 're not really big ones

#s9
I think that um in general the whole immigration policy is n't quite as open as it should be That it 's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they 're educated and will be a good asset to America

#s10
It 's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that

#s15
Okay

#s17
Uh where did you come from

#s18
Okay

#s19
Okay

#s20
so where did your parents come from

#s22
Okay

#s23
And

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
Yeah

#s29
Uh-huh

#s32
Yep

#s33
Uh-huh

#s37
I 'm from Pennsylvania

#s40
Yeah

#s42
Right

#s43
and uh a lot of

#s45
Uh-huh

#s46
Yeah

#s48
Um I think that 's all right

#s49
I um

#s50
at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing

#s51
Do you have an opinion about it

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
No

#s58
okay

#s60
Right

#s61
Well a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who 's Chinese and immigrated from China

#s62
And um you know he um got a green card is and is in good standing in America and China

#s63
but only because he was always MUMBLEx nice to the Chinese government and all that

#s65
and he was always on pretty good terms with them

#s68
But um their

#s69
my sister just had a baby

#s70
and they 're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing

#s71
And it 's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem

#s72
It 's just very difficult to get a woman who does n't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here

#s74
Yeah

#s76
Uh-huh

#s79
Right

#s81
Yeah

#s82
that 's and I think that 's pretty crazy because I mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back

#s84
and aside for that they 're the best and brightest of China

#s85
so it 's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can

#s89
Yeah

#s91
Uh-huh

#s92
Yeah

#s94
Um

#s96
See these are refujees you mean

#s98
Okay

#s99
Right

#s100
okay

#s102
Right

#s103
Well um I do n't have any problem with that

#s104
Um

#s107
Yeah

#s108
I guess so

#s110
Uh-huh

#s111
Right

#s114
Uh-huh

#s117
Yeah
