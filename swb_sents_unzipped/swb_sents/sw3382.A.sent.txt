#s1
Uh I guess uh I 've always been kind of interested in in space and stuff

#s2
I 've read a lot of the the uh astronomy books and and stuff like that

#s3
Uh

#s9
Uh to a degree

#s10
I have n't kept up as uh much as I would like

#s12
I 've just been so busy

#s13
uh

#s15
I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then

#s16
so

#s22
Yeah

#s23
Well I would n't even mind uh being a pilot on one

#s24
or right now

#s25
but I 'm probably getting a little too old for that

#s27
Right

#s28
Yeah

#s29
Well they they just made leaps and jumps

#s30
I think a lot of our our technology we have is is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel uh uh equipment and stuff that

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Yeah

#s42
Yeah

#s43
I do n't know if you ever watch Gallagher you know

#s44
he 's one of the comedians

#s45
and and you know he he talks a lot on on Velcro

#s49
Wh- i- what would we do without it

#s53
Yeah

#s55
Yeah

#s56
Yeah

#s57
there 's there 's a lot of a lot of little things that have come up

#s58
I know maybe some of the big things that uh uh

#s59
concentrated foods for one maybe

#s60
I don- Uh I do n't know

#s63
it 's also just

#s64
I 've I 've often pictured uh in my mind you know what it would be like to just what would you find if you just kept on going kept on going

#s67
Uh I guess our minds are so uh uh what is it Uh finite

#s69
when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object and it 's hard to to see you know

#s72
I always thought well what do you do

#s73
hit a brick wall eventually

#s74
It 's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely

#s80
Yeah

#s81
But

#s84
Yeah

#s85
I know it 's I think it 's in people 's nature to be the first to do something

#s87
And I I 'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like you know

#s92
Yeah

#s94
Huh

#s95
I think that 's what made us uh progress to the state we are is our curiosity

#s100
There must be some better so- better way of doing this

#s101
A better place to be or whatever you know

#s102
it 's

#s104
So you you are always looking for something better

#s107
I know at work uh people always complain to me

#s108
I well you are always whining

#s109
and it 's

#s110
I 'm always looking for something better

#s111
Uh

#s113
There 's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it

#s117
Yeah

#s119
Well they are always finding easier ways

#s120
and you know just because they do n't talk about it or something like that

#s122
And they are doing it un- you know unconsciously

#s130
Uh-huh

#s132
Right
