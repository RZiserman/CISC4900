Uh pets

#s5
Do you have pets

#s10
Oh my goodness

#s12
We have three dogs and two birds at this point

#s16
Parakeets

#s19
Oh have a ball with them

#s21
Well no

#s22
because my dogs chase them

#s24
So in order to have the birds not stuffed I have to keep them in their cages

#s29
Uh-huh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s32
Well we had that happen once um

#s33
my son had the bird back in his room

#s34
because it 's his bir- well the first one that we had was his bird

#s35
and I had a ceiling fan put up

#s36
and it the bird got away from him one afternoon

#s37
and I mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall

#s38
I thought oh so much for the bird

#s40
No

#s41
he 's still alive and kicking

#s45
No

#s46
I guess we did n't have it high enough or he did n't get hit in just the right spot

#s47
but it threw him up against the wall you know

#s48
and he slid down the wall

#s52
Oh gosh

#s53
Oh I hate them

#s58
Oh my goodness

#s64
You 're kidding

#s72
Oh well that 's pretty good

#s75
Oh yeah

#s76
oh yeah

#s82
Oh you 're kidding

#s83
Oh

#s87
Oh my gosh

#s88
I can not ima-

#s89
I just I do n't

#s90
in fact my brother has a uh a exotic pet shop out in California

#s91
and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know

#s92
I 'm going do n't do that because they wo n't come in my house

#s99
Uh-huh

#s103
Oh my gosh

#s104
Oh my gosh

#s105
That is wild

#s106
Oh I just ca n't do those and the lizards and the all those those things

#s108
they they need to stay outside far away from me

#s112
Yeah

#s118
Oh yeah

#s119
they are so expensive

#s120
Well my son was just dying for a bird

#s121
and I 'm really allergic to them

#s122
so I try to stay away from them except I 've gotten real attached to this one

#s124
and and uh we went down to Canton one time oh gosh two or three years ago now

#s126
and he 'd saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird in a bird cage

#s127
and and that stinking bird when I brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you

#s129
clamped onto my finger and would not

#s130
I mean I had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage

#s131
and he has tried to bite me for two years

#s132
and all of a sudden this bird and I have become wonderful friends

#s134
He gives me kisses

#s135
he talks now

#s137
and it 's just hysterical

#s138
I 'm the only one that pays attention to him

#s140
And I 'm a substitute teacher

#s141
and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom 's making me get rid of the bird

#s142
we have too many pets

#s143
I thought yeah right come tell me about it you know

#s145
They knew the sucker when they saw one

#s146
So now we have two parakeets
