What what

#s2
how do you get your main source of current events

#s8
I either watch the news

#s9
or or occasionally I 'll read the paper

#s11
Um no

#s12
I think the media 's a little bit too manipulative

#s13
They allow you uh

#s14
they they try to lead you too much I believe

#s15
and sometimes they 're not very open

#s16
I I do n't know

#s17
I think they 're a little bit biased sometimes

#s18
Like for example the Kennedy the Kennedy rape case

#s19
The coverage on that was you know

#s20
when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty

#s21
You know they try to have you form opinions or whatever

#s22
and then I I did n't like the thi- the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that

#s23
You know basically I I I think they do n't present the the whole sides of of everything

#s25
Right

#s26
It 's it 's it 's instead of reporting the news it 's more like an editorial I believe on a lot of issues

#s30
Yeah

#s32
Well when when I was in school I um I was a communications major

#s33
so I I I 'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and and so forth

#s37
I was

#s38
and um I we- I ventured off in a whole entire different field field

#s39
I went with the state

#s41
And uh I um went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability

#s42
calculate benefits

#s44
Yeah

#s45
So the

#s46
so and you know working you know working for state government you hear all about current events about things going on within the state itself

#s47
So that that 's another source that I I where I keep up with current events

#s48
and

#s54
It 's a lot of money

#s56
It 's a lot of money

#s62
No

#s63
well no

#s64
I I I primarily deal with the state employees

#s65
but I I find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the like the state of North Carolina 's budget and stuff like that

#s66
And I really know what the budget is

#s67
and and uh uh when they were saying we were so poor and they could n't pay taxes and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that

#s68
and you know I 'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has

#s69
and it it 's just funny

#s70
You know so that 's that 's that 's

#s71
so I do n't have a whole lot of faith in in you know the news

#s72
Course it 's

#s73
they they get what they hear from

#s74
but you know it 's not always I I think one hundred percent reliable

#s76
I think they need to do a little bit go into a little bit more depth uh before they would just report like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that

#s77
because I mean another example is the uh AIDS issue or whatever

#s78
You know someone said Oh I found a cure

#s79
They immediately

#s80
the headlines on the news or whatever is Someone says they found a cure for AIDS

#s81
And then two months later it 's discovered it 's not you know

#s82
before they before they come out with something like that they need to to research the matter I believe a little bit more

#s84
Well that

#s85
well yeah

#s86
I I

#s87
it

#s88
I think the
