Hi Nancy

#s4
Well do you do a lot of dining out

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Well we do s- some dining out

#s11
Um I I do a lot of cooking

#s12
so um mostly like when we go out you know it 's my husband and I

#s13
I we do n't go out too often as a family um unless it 's like a fast-food kind of thing

#s14
But um but we do enjoy dining out

#s15
One of our favorite places here in in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe

#s16
I do n't know if you

#s17
have you ever been there

#s21
Um well actually there 's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and uh

#s24
Have you

#s25
Th- now that 's down in uh Highland Park

#s27
It 's Highland Park Village

#s28
Did you like it

#s31
Oh I love it

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Oh it is it 's fabulous

#s38
It really is a great place

#s40
Atlantic Cafe is down on I believe it 's on McKinney

#s42
Um and o- originally the two the the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and th- the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe

#s43
And then they they separated

#s44
and the guy started Cafe Pacific

#s45
And I loved them both

#s46
I really do

#s47
I think they 're wonderful

#s48
That 's our favorite

#s49
You know what we 'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is Houston 's

#s50
Have you been there

#s54
It 's wonderful

#s55
The only thing is you have to wait

#s56
You have you have to expect to wait at least an hour

#s58
So you have to go knowing you 're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in

#s59
And a- as long as you know that it 's okay

#s60
But they have I think one just about the best prime rib um anywhere in the area

#s63
I love it

#s65
And my husband really likes their ribs

#s66
So it 's hysterical

#s67
We go in

#s68
and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in

#s69
and then we get there

#s70
and we do n't even look at the menu

#s72
I know right away what we what we want

#s73
Yeah

#s74

#s78

#s83
I 've nev- I 've I 've been there for like you know lunch

#s85

#s86
And it was good

#s87
yeah

#s90
Oh that 's great

#s91

#s92
Another nice place for for prime rib is Baby Doe 's

#s94
Maxwell 's nice

#s95

#s98
And I did n't think we ate out very often

#s99
See

#s100
Baby Doe 's is nice

#s102
And one place I 'd never been that I would really like to go to uh is Lawry 's

#s103
I 've heard that 's real good Lawry 's Prime Rib

#s107
I 've I 've never been there

#s108
but I 've heard it 's real good

#s111
Yes

#s112
Yes

#s113
actually they have one in Richardson that I 've been to

#s114
Uh they have real nice lunches

#s115
Have you have you been there for lunch

#s116
Or

#s118
Yeah

#s122
Really

#s123
Really

#s126
Uh-huh

#s129
The specials

#s131
Have you ever been to Biffin 's

#s133
I keep hearing about it

#s134
I keep hearing the advertisements of it

#s138
and and they keep saying you know oh it 's wonderful

#s139
it 's wonderful

#s140
I have not been over there

#s141
and I was thinking you know it 's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl

#s144
And uh I 've I 've not been there

#s151
I 've been there

#s153
That was nice

#s162
Oh

#s163
I 've heard of it

#s164
Where where it 's made

#s165
it 's like it 's like a

#s166
it 's all chocolate like made like a paper bag

#s168
and it 's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something

#s170
Yeah

#s172
Oh

#s174
Oh

#s177
Oh

#s179
Oh I bet it was

#s180
I bet it was

#s182
The last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father 's Day

#s183
and we took another friend with us

#s185
and uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves

#s186
And so we had they had uh like a berry assortment

#s187
It was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom

#s189
And you know they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the

#s190
you know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it

#s194
and it was outstanding

#s196
It was really really relatively simple

#s197
but oh it was good

#s198
It was really good

#s204
You ca n't find them

#s205
Yeah

#s207
Yeah

#s208
yeah

#s209
yeah

#s210
You know i- I 'm originally from Connecticut

#s211
and uh I was home a few years ago

#s212
and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner

#s213
and uh I was really amazed you know

#s214
the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint

#s215
You know they were real real pretty

#s216
but they lacked the service

#s217
and they lacked the at- the just the

#s218
I do n't know

#s219
The restaurants down here seem like they have uh

#s220
I guess there 's so much competition that they really have to be good

#s222
And I thought I would really miss that

#s229
Uh-huh

#s230
And you know in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good

#s232
Because the ones that are n't so good do n't just do n't make it

#s239
Oh really
