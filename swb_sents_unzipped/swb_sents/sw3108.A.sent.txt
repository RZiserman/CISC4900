Well what movies have you seen recently Valerie

#s4
Oh we have n't seen that one yet

#s6
Oh it was n't that good

#s11
The most recent one that uh my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER

#s13
That was excellent

#s14
It was just a really a really funny movie

#s16
At the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves

#s17
There were parts that were sad

#s18
I mean it just ran the gamut of emotion

#s22
And but it was just enter- all around entertaining

#s24
Uh it 's still on to the best of my knowledge

#s27
Oh

#s29
Uh it 's I think it 's less than two hours

#s33
We we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever

#s35
Yeah

#s36
but this one it was fairly long

#s37
I I 'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes maybe

#s41
But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby

#s44
uh who was the

#s45
oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy

#s47
So we really enjoyed that

#s51
Yeah

#s52
I think that uh I can highly recommend that movie this to see

#s56
Yeah

#s60
Uh we generally rent a couple a week

#s61
Uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you 've got to rent it on Thursday

#s64
They get they get taken up at the store

#s66
so

#s69
We will rent two or three movies on Thursday

#s70
and uh with luck you 'll have one or two that are good

#s74
Most of them are a coin flip

#s82
Yeah

#s84
Yeah well

#s85
Quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends

#s87
and uh we 'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see

#s88
and Uh Uh generally try to stay in the at least P G range

#s94
The uh the oldest is nine

#s95
the youngest is three

#s96
He does n't really pay attention

#s99
The five year old does n't have the attention span either

#s102
But the the nine year old will watch anything that 's on T V

#s104
So

#s112
Yeah

#s113
my wife took uh I think the kids to see that one

#s114
but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch

#s119
The

#s120
uh oh we saw this movie

#s121
PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented uh last weekend

#s124
Harrison Ford

#s127
It 's uh he is a prosecuting attorney

#s128
and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered

#s131
and he 's trying to find it

#s132
but course it 's one of these with a twist where it looks like he 's the one that wound up killing her

#s133
so it 's And it 's an extremely long movie

#s136
It 's it 's over two hours long

#s139
Which

#s140
uh my wife enj- she likes the suspense movies

#s141
I enjoy them to a degree

#s146
Save that for another day

#s149
Yeah

#s151
Yeah

#s152
I think you it 's uh it 's something I think you would enjoy

#s153
yes

#s157
It it 's like most suspense movies

#s158
what was

#s159
it was on T V recently uh

#s160
FATAL ATTRACTION

#s162
It 's one that once you 've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really ca n't see it again

#s165
so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened

#s167
so once once you seen one that 's a suspenseful type movie like that then it 's it 's not good for a second watching particularly

#s172
At least I do n't think so

#s176
I do n't know

#s177
we 've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE 'S any number of times

#s179
It 's just slapstick comedy

#s182
Sit there and laugh

#s183
and my one grandson and I

#s184
my wife ca n't understand it

#s185
but we like BILL AND TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which is another funny one

#s191
Yeah

#s192
we like to laugh

#s194
I I have a theory

#s195
I like movies for entertainment

#s196
I do n't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie

#s202
Life 's depressing enough

#s204
Well I 've certainly enjoyed talking with you

#s206
Okay

#s207
bye

#s210
Have a nice weekend

#s212
Okay

#s214
Bye
