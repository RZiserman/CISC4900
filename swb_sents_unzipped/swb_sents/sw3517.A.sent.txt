Okay

#s6
I 'm in Dallas Texas

#s8
What about yourself

#s10
Okay

#s12
Uh-huh

#s15
No

#s16
I 've lived here for almost five years now

#s18
And I 'm a uh

#s19
before that I was at school in Rochester New York

#s20
and I 'm originally from Boston

#s22
That 's right

#s23
but I like it

#s25
Well I missed it at first

#s26
but now I go back there

#s27
and I 'm a real wimp about the cold

#s28
So I like it here

#s30
It 's nice

#s33
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s40
I know

#s42
Uh tell me where that is uh

#s44
I probably do know

#s46
but I do n't know it by that name

#s48
Okay

#s49
Sure

#s51
Oh okay

#s52
yeah

#s53
I know that area

#s54
That 's a nice area

#s59
Uh Oh that 's quite a range

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
yeah

#s68
Well I am uh I 'm gosh I 'm barely in Dallas

#s69
I 'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway

#s72
And I guess we have a similar situation

#s73
I mean we 've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand

#s75
and then we 've got Bent Tree right across the street

#s76
so I do n't I do n't even know how high those go

#s78
but some of those are pretty big

#s81
Yeah

#s82
So it 's that 's the strange thing about I guess Dallas because back where I 'm from you would n't have that sort of a variation at all

#s83
They 'd all be pretty similar to one another within a a couple miles

#s84
So

#s86
Yeah

#s89
Uh-huh

#s90
yeah

#s91
I 've noticed that

#s93
Uh-huh

#s95
Uh we 've got a house

#s96
let 's see

#s97
we moved in about four years ago

#s98
and it was it had previously been unoccupied

#s99
but it had existed for three years

#s101
This is a whole block of homes that uh a builder built all of them

#s102
and I guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away type of deal

#s103
So the whole block was all foreclosed

#s105
And so some were vacant for quite a while before they you know they finally sold them because there were so many

#s108
Yes

#s109
no

#s110
the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they 'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open

#s112
But

#s113
yeah

#s115
So we just you know we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that

#s117
And uh we 're really we have n't had any problems

#s118
and you know we had originally thought we 'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we could n't afford anything

#s119
But the prices are much lower here

#s120
and this was definitely not a fix up special

#s121
but I 'll tell you

#s122
it takes all my time

#s123
Between we put in our own sprinkler system and I just finished repainting the exterior and you know making drapes and buying furniture it 's just a money pit

#s124
Really is

#s127
So

#s128
Uh-huh

#s132
Uh-huh

#s135
Oh no
