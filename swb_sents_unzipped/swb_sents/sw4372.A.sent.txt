Well actually I do n't think they 're out of line

#s6
De- Devil 's advocate possibly

#s7
but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes

#s8
and whe- whether or not you agree with that law i- you 're still circumventing it

#s9
You are legal in in your circumvention of that law

#s12
Really I I I do n't think that 's a valid argument

#s13
I think that most people are quite aware they 're not paying that six percent sales tax

#s14
Um s- s- naturally some some things you just ca n't find in your local K-Mart or or uh Bryn Mawr stereo dealer

#s15
Uh but th- th- th- then why not pay pay the sales tax MUMBLEx

#s16
Corporations have to

#s17
why should an individual just because it 's just because the state ca n't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax

#s20
Yes

#s25
I I 'll agree it it 's not your responsibility

#s26
but b- is it also legal for you to do that

#s27
W- w- fr- from what I understand from v- v- various net readings i- i- it the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes uh in into place in the next few years

#s28
It is it is a lost revenue stream right now

#s29
and states c- can use all the revenue they can get

#s30
With some with something like that d- do your arguments still apply

#s34
Which is exactly what businesses do at the present

#s40
And I I I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it

#s42
That 's my understanding of the way uh the way it works

#s43
Usually the the person ordering does n't pay

#s44
But the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay

#s45
And there r- there are s- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that

#s47
I- MUMBLEx

#s48
No

#s49
Businesses uh if purchasing things mail order

#s50
if if I 'm a computer consulting firm and I see these this great deal on forty-six mother boards uh from from say Utah Um I I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax

#s51
My a- accounting department will at the end of the month

#s52
I think that i- i- I think that 's the way things work in Pennsylvania

#s53
And I know they work that way in uh say here in D C

#s56
Yeah

#s59
That 's true

#s60
I- i- a r- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh I I forgot that

#s61
There there is no well defined mechanism at all

#s62
and and that it is a a l- loss I I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju- just to do just that in or- in order to gain the revenue that 's being lost

#s63
Uh I mean I I do n't know if I agree with that

#s64
But it but
