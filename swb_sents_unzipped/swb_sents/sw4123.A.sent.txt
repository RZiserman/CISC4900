Jimmy so how do you get most of your news

#s6
Oh wow

#s7
So when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when

#s9
Oh okay

#s10
Well I would probably be a junkie or s- watch C N N a lot

#s11
but I do n't uh I do n't uh subscribe to cable be- because of the poor service and also uh because

#s13
well I uh I give to the United Way

#s14
and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that

#s17
Yeah

#s18
I take away a uh addiction

#s19
Oh something

#s21
Well I

#s29
Oh

#s30
What what uh newspapers do you read

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
For a while there I I I uh subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES a- actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance

#s35
well she was unemployed for a while

#s36
so she you know really needed to look at the the want- help wanted ads

#s38
and so often they they tr- the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspape- uh news

#s40
And I do n't know

#s41
NEW YORK TIMES is okay

#s42
but uh and when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so

#s43
but uh I mean they they say it 's like the sixth grade reading level

#s45
but I swear it 's at least second or third grade sometimes

#s48
But I do n't know

#s49
uh I think if you listen to like N P R or something like

#s52
That 's pretty good

#s53
Uh and I like listening to that on on uh

#s54
when I get a chance when I 'm in the car a long enough time to to listen to it

#s55
because I

#s61
Uh

#s64
Well McNeil Neil- and Lehrer

#s65
I guess he 's leaving

#s66
one of them is leaving

#s68
Uh they 're they 're pretty good too

#s69
Uh I guess a year ago you 're probably watching C N N a lot

#s70
right

#s73
Had that invasion or whatever it is

#s75
Uh but I I do n't know

#s76
I guess a lot of it 's still a lot of hype

#s77
Look at the the Smith trial

#s79
I mean that was a joke

#s83
Oh yeah

#s84
the N P R doing that

#s85
yeah

#s86
I know

#s87
I had uh some visitor

#s88
and he was just in- just I do n't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly

#s90
Uh and I guess that 's good when it 's live if you if you 'll really want that

#s91
but that 's not really providing you news

#s93
It 's it 's more like a media event rather than reporting

#s95
Oh really

#s96
That 's kind of boring to me I think

#s103
Yeah

#s104
Yeah

#s105
I guess that 's true

#s106
But one of the ways that I get information is uh every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this this thing

#s107
it 's free inside the company

#s108
it 's called INTELLECT

#s109
and and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really literally

#s110
I 've I 've actually read the actual articles

#s111
they 're pretty g-
