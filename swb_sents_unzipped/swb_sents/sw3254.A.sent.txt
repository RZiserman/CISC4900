Okay

#s2
Where do you enjoy dining out

#s4
Yes

#s5
do you have children

#s8
Uh

#s11
Yeah

#s12
that makes a difference does n't it

#s14
What area of the country do you live in

#s16
Yes

#s17
I am too

#s18
But

#s20
I did too

#s21
I 'm from the Dayton area

#s23
Oh

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
That 's right

#s31
Yes

#s37
When we travel we look for Wendy 's because we have kids

#s38
and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals

#s40
and then that way they can get their burgers and fries

#s41
and we can have a salad bar

#s43
so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy 's because it 's all either McDonald 's or Dairy Queens

#s46
Right

#s47
that 's right

#s50
I know

#s53
Uh-huh

#s56
Uh-huh

#s59
Oh

#s61
Uh-huh

#s62
Um

#s64
Yeah

#s66
Well what are some of your your favorite inexpensive places

#s73
Uh-huh

#s76
Oh we are Little Caesar fans here

#s78
that 's where we always go

#s82
Yes

#s83
we like Grandy 's too

#s89
Oh

#s91
Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out or a big meal

#s93
Where do you go for steaks

#s95
Oh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s99
Oh

#s100
You ever been to Houston 's on Belt Line

#s102
That 's where we go to get steaks

#s104
they have a teriyaki steak there

#s105
and when we have something to celebrate we head to Houston 's

#s106
They do n't take reservations

#s107
and you wind up waiting about an hour

#s109
but the food is good

#s110
and they 've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five o'clock

#s111
then you can go right through

#s113
But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks

#s114
so that 's our nice place to go

#s115
We do n't usually take the kids when we go there

#s120
Yeah

#s122
Right

#s123
That 's right

#s126
Yeah

#s127
that 's the way with my husband

#s128
He 's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends

#s129
and I 've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere

#s130
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend

#s133
Right

#s135
Yes

#s138
Uh-huh

#s140
Right

#s143
Yep
