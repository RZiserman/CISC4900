Uh I I do n't think so

#s7
Possibly in the jury selection would be the only

#s8
just for example what we 're seeing in California I guess

#s9
It makes you wonder uh had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome

#s10
Uh and and the problems that that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating Uh just makes you wonder I guess whether or not they

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
That 's that 's bad

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
No

#s20
It

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s26
Oh yes

#s31
That 's right

#s33
They 're only going to suffer

#s35
T- they 're only going to suffer

#s36
They they 've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence

#s37
Uh I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that are n't black or uh do n't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape

#s38
and uh

#s46
I know

#s47
Yeah

#s48
it 's really ridiculous

#s50
Against forty other people being

#s55
Those deaths

#s56
Uh-huh

#s60
Or just a by- an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what

#s63
Um

#s65
MUMBLEx Or or beaten

#s68
Um

#s70
Right

#s71
That 's that 's exactly how I feel too

#s72
I would n't have uh they would n't have stopped my car for any anything had I seen them coming

#s73
But I was just wondering since you 're you 're in you 're back east uh and a little closer to the the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here

#s76
Oh

#s81
Uh-huh

#s83
Oh

#s84
In what uh section of the government do you work

#s86

#s87
