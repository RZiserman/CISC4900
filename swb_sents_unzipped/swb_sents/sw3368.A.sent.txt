Okay

#s2
What type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day

#s4
Yeah

#s5
that 's right

#s6
That is really an invasion of privacy

#s8
I I find it very annoying when I 've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly

#s9
the solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and

#s11
Does that happen in your part of the country

#s14
I uh I come home

#s16
and I am trying to get a few things done

#s17
and I ca n't do anything but answer the telephone

#s19
Some evenings are worse than others

#s20
but I wish I could put a stop to it

#s21
but I do n't know what to do to stop it

#s25
Uh-huh

#s26
They would think it did n't mean them I guess

#s29
Everybody but me

#s31
Oh goodness

#s32
Are you stil- do you live at home with your parents

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
So your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family

#s41
Now what can you do to stop that

#s46
No

#s48
Just have to live with it I guess

#s50
Try to remember to respect their privacy and maybe they will respect yours

#s51
and

#s54
Do you have brothers

#s59
Oh okay

#s60
I was ra-

#s61
I had two younger brothers

#s62
and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations

#s63
and

#s67
I would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they could n't hear me

#s68
and then they would go get on the other extension

#s70
and I could hear them

#s71
but I could n't get them to hang up you know

#s75
Even it in the office I uh find that people walk up

#s76
and and when you 're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy they 'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up

#s80
Uh-huh

#s87
Yeah

#s89
Let 's see

#s90
I ca n't think of anything else I 'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors

#s92
About the only thing that really bothers me

#s93
I do n't have that many people coming to my door

#s96
Uh-huh

#s98
And I guess that 's really th- the thing that really bugs me the most

#s99
I ca n't think tha-

#s100
our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me

#s101
but they 've all gotten grown up now

#s103
and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up

#s105
but What else would be an annoyance

#s106
Well I guess traffic could be an annoyance

#s109
Do you have a lot of traffic in your area

#s113
Uh-huh

#s114
Some days it 's real real bad here

#s115
and you would like to feel like it 's an invasion of privacy because you ca n't even ride down the road without people all the way around you you know

#s118
But

#s123
It really is

#s124
and pretty noisy

#s126
It really is

#s128
I live right on a main thoroughfare

#s129
so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy

#s130
because it at first you 'd hear a lot of noise especially at night you know when you go to bed

#s133
And every time a a fire truck or anything went down the road I would wake up

#s134
but I guess I have gotten used to it because I do n't even hear it anymore

#s137
And uh I just close it out I guess

#s138
because I do n't I do n't remember waking up in several years at night when I 'd hear a fire truck go by you know

#s141
I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me

#s146
They would have to chop down the door and get you out I guess

#s149
Let 's see

#s150
What else is an invasion

#s152
Oh

#s154
Well did you have has name all over them

#s159
That was yours

#s160
Yeah

#s163
Yeah

#s166
Yeah
