#s1
Do you have any

#s9
Did it work

#s12
No

#s13
right

#s15
I um I had a for many years I had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel

#s16
I just love them

#s17
Her name was Molly

#s18
but she is n't alive any more

#s19
We had her for um fifteen years I think my family did and just loved her

#s20
She was the greatest greatest um went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle

#s22
Yeah

#s23
I have a cat now

#s24
He just turned seven also

#s25
and he 's I um got him in Arizona and when I used to live there

#s27
and he is huge

#s28
He is eighteen pounds

#s30
Just

#s31
um I got him

#s32
he was um he was born in the wild like in a in a shed and had never been in a building when I got him

#s34
So he

#s35
and he 's he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he 's very long and lanky

#s36
but he 's a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that I 've had him for seven years

#s38
No

#s39
no

#s41
he 's

#s42
yeah

#s43
he 's great

#s44
and uh he 's uh he 's really spoiled though

#s45
So but he 's really big

#s46
so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights

#s47
and when he was younger I think he started them

#s48
and now I think he barely makes it

#s49
I think he gets beat up even though he 's big because he 's pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then

#s52
yeah

#s60
Oh I 've seen them

#s61

#s66
actually I ca n't remember

#s67
they were used to be used on ships and in for for mousers you know

#s69
so they 're very nautical too

#s72
Yeah

#s73
I just

#s74
uh I think I 'm I think I 'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore

#s75
but I 'm not sure

#s77
Yeah

#s81
Yeah

#s85
Yeah

#s88
I 'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u- let me

#s89
