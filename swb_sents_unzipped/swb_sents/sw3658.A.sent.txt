#s2
Okay

#s5
That 's right

#s8
What would we like to say

#s9
I think

#s10
Uh-huh

#s11
I think that 's what the subject is about

#s13
In the Dallas the MORNING TIMES

#s15
I guess I did not

#s21
Well it 's been interesting that we

#s23
Yes

#s24
So we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will uh say that they think that everyone has a right to health care

#s26
And yet I do n't think we 've ever quite decided who 's really supposed to pay for it

#s29
Which is why people are talking about

#s30
we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that 's more fair

#s33
You have health insurance

#s36
Through your company

#s42
Oh my goodness

#s44
That 's must have been hard

#s45
How was your care at Parkland

#s48
But yet Parkland is not free either

#s52
Is it affordable

#s53
So you did have a good experience

#s56
Is your wife better I hope

#s59
I 'm real sorry

#s61
Sure

#s63
It does happen

#s64
but it 's very sad

#s67
Well so am I

#s68
Actually uh I 'm a pediatrician

#s70
and I feel very strongly about uh children and uh developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year Where we certainly proved that we 're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most

#s73
So uh I 'm really quite active in trying to uh be proactive at least for children 's issues

#s74
It 's very complex very complicated

#s75
but uh I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits

#s83
Um

#s88
Well and the costs have so much has gone up so much

#s89
The cost of immunizations for example uh and just the legal the legal benefits uh

#s90
that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera

#s92
So well I do n't know

#s93
it 's it is interesting

#s94
in case you did n't know Texas leads the nation in uninsured children

#s95
Thirty-one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid

#s97
So uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care

#s98
And I work in the children 's Parkland system

#s99
and it 's pretty overwhelming to me

#s101
But uh it 's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county
