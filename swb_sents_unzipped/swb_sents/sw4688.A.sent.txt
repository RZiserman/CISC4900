Well we in in in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances

#s2
Uh the uh way back what twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer I did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all this kind of thing

#s3
and we kept that going for about a month

#s4
and it became so onerous that we gave up on it

#s7
You know so uh the only thing we 're you know that we do now is uh I keep a a little spread sheet of uh what I call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth

#s8
Uh and I only update that oh I do n't know maybe once every quarter or so Every three months Just basically when the statements come in You know Just to see whether or not we 're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what

#s11
Uh that 's really about you know the extent of uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that we 're doing

#s15
Huh

#s16
Oh dear that 's terrible

#s19

my next door neighbor just lost his job In a you know one of these uh

#s68
his company went broke I mean went you know bankrupt

#s69
Actually it was a subsidiary of a of an outfit called U S Shoe or something

#s82
Uh it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present

#s83
I mean it sounds sounds terrible to say

#s84
but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than most people probably ar- might be In terms of keeping keeping score of input and output
