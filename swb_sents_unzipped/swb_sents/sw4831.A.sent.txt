See wh- when you 're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good

#s2
and and you know the pay is regular

#s3
but uh you know sometimes you do n't get tuned in to what 's going on

#s4
And I I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that anybody could get in in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what 's going on

#s5
And maybe that 's that 's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do

#s6
What 's what 's your feeling about benefits

#s7
What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s26
Well th-

#s27
I I well I work for the government

#s28
and uh actually I work for the F B I

#s30
And uh and so you know we we do n't there 's lots of things that we do n't get told For good reason

#s31
But uh but basically uh there 's lots of things that that we should know about projects

#s32
I 'm an engineer You know

#s34
I 'm I 'm a COTR

#s35
And sometim-

#s36
and I I worked in the same lab with a guy

#s37
and we did n't really know that much about each other 's projects for two years

#s38
And we should have you know

#s39
we 're we 're now collaborating

#s41
And MUMBLEx

#s43
for two years we did n't And we which was a kind of stupid

#s44
But uh but our organization is doing something else t- on Monday

#s45
Uh we 're having a for all unclassified programs we 're we 're having little tables put up in front of MUMBLEx lab in the hallways

#s46
and every all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do Which I thought was kind of interesting and But uh but that that sort sort of thing

#s49
But if you I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what 's going on

#s51
And and but of course most time most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know

#s52
And you know if you do n't really count If you 're not part of the program you might not get told for months

#s53
Or you might you know if it does n't impact you directly Or if your management does n't think that

#s54
But but regard to benefits You know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing

#s55
In the private sector I would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid-fifties wa- is keeping a job until you retire

#s58
And engineers are uh are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies

#s59
And uh it 's very much like the military

#s60
it windows out

#s61
You know you you think well boy I 'm getting more money

#s62
and I 'm getting more responsibility

#s63
I 'm doing this

#s64
But as you climb up that tree pretty soon you 're the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree

#s66
and pretty soon somebody falls off

#s67
I I 've fallen off twice in the private sector

#s69
And uh and you know I can get up

#s78
Uh-huh

#s79
Yeah

#s84
Uh-huh

#s87
Yeah

#s88
he may be retired
