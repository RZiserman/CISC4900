#s1
All right this is easy for me since I

#s3
Yeah

#s4
well I travel

#s5
I do about forty percent of my time is on the road

#s7
I eat a lot of meals out

#s8
well I 'm also married

#s9
and my wife is an A one cook

#s10
but she enjoys eating out

#s11
so I have to share it with her

#s12
And uh actually it 's very easy for me because I I have a prac- make it a practice when I am out

#s13
I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here

#s15
So I look for just about anything

#s16
and it 's it 's uh it 's a lot of fun

#s17
I do n't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because I you know

#s21
Oh sure

#s22
yeah

#s23
and it 's it 's really great

#s24
I I I like different types of food

#s26
Uh oh you na- okay you name it

#s27
Let 's see

#s28
you 've got one down in uh down near uh Addison

#s29
uh there 's two restaurants that I particularly like that I every time I get into Texas or I get into Atlanta Georgia I make sure I go

#s30
and that 's Houston 's

#s33
Yep

#s34
okay

#s36
It 's it 's great

#s37
There 's a a restaurant in um right outside of Reading Pennsylvania it 's called Alfredo 's that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people

#s39
But it is fab- fantastic

#s40
Uh there 's a restaurant and I do n't recall the name of it uh in uh Panama City

#s41
Of course not too many people want to rush back to Panama City uh Panama the country uh Panama

#s45
No

#s46
this is the country this is the country Panama

#s47
all right

#s50
And uh but I have gotten to quite a few

#s51
And I go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there

#s52
I you know and I know the locations

#s53
and I know the places

#s54
but I lot of times I do n't remember the names

#s55
I 'd have to go back through some expense reports

#s57
But particularly down in your area I 'm looking for some some more restaurants

#s58
So I you know I do n't know what 's what 's down there the ones out in Addison

#s61
Not particularly

#s63
that 's one of the few

#s64
why which one were you going to recommend

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Right

#s71
Okay

#s72
I have a

#s75
Okay

#s76
let

#s77
I 'm I 'm writing it down

#s79
Okay

#s83
I 've been there

#s85
Okay

#s86
I 've been there

#s87
Um one down there is the uh

#s88
I think it 's an old schoolhouse

#s93
Well I like the food

#s94
but I do n't care for the clowning around

#s98
Oh really

#s99
Oh I 've had

#s101
That 's it

#s102
that 's it

#s103
I 've had excellent food there

#s106
True

#s107
True

#s109
Uh-huh

#s110
Yeah

#s111
all right

#s112
well that 's great

#s113
Uh no

#s114
Italian is fine

#s115
I make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi 's which is right down there in Ad-

#s117
Oh yeah

#s119
All right

#s120
Really

#s127
Uh-huh

#s129
Good

#s131
Well this is great

#s132
This is going to give me some more places to go

#s134
Okay

#s135
fine

#s136
I guess our time 's about up

#s137
so

#s139
Uh well they do n't always

#s141
Yeah

#s142
I they 've been doing that when uh the circuits are busy

#s144
and other than that they you know leave you go about five minutes

#s145
and then that that 's about it

#s146
I guess that 's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat

#s147
so

#s149
It was a pleasure talking to you

#s151
Okay

#s152
You bet

#s154
Bye-bye
