#s5
Do they feel that way

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
Well I I think it 's a good idea just because I 'm opposed to to the drugs

#s11
I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it

#s13
It 's uh

#s14
I do n't know

#s15
I do n't really liken it to alcohol

#s16
but yet that can be carried to an extreme too

#s18
So I think it 's a good idea

#s19
and I think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you 're

#s21
I do n't know that their job would be at risk

#s22
because I think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs

#s24
I would think that

#s25
is that how they do it at T I maybe

#s26
That

#s32
Uh-huh

#s34
Well I guess I I draw a hard line

#s35
but you know I would I 'm I 'm in favor of of that type of thing

#s36
That uh you you have people out there that are responsible for certain things

#s40
and you expect them to do their job

#s41
and it it is possible that you know that they ca n't do as good a job uh as they might do

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Right

#s48
and you never know

#s49
they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that whatever they 're taking at the time

#s52
and and it would be uh you know out of the question

#s54
Also I guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds

#s57
I sub in the schools

#s59
so I 've you know had a

#s60
they they talk a lot about drugs there

#s63
and I think it 's good that they 're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools

#s65
But you know I think they can test all they want for drugs you know

#s66
and if they need to do that as a condition for employment

#s68
and I know many of them are doing it

#s69
I know my son has had to do it for both Sam 's and Wal-Mart

#s71
and I do n't know how many others are doing that

#s72
and and I think that 's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age

#s76
and uh I do n't know

#s77
it 's just a problem that p- no one is sure just how to handle I think

#s81
Really

#s83
It 's that high

#s87
Oh

#s89
I did n't realize it was that expensive

#s92
Uh-huh

#s96
Uh-huh

#s98
Just lucky to have jobs

#s102
Uh-huh

#s105
I just I did n't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period

#s107
and Sam 's and Wal-Mart are are owned by the same people

#s109
he took one for for uh Wal-Mart for job hiring

#s111
and then Sam 's called him

#s112
and and he took another one

#s114
and I you know I do n't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together

#s116
I can see if

#s117
because you know if it 's a thousand dollars that 's a thousand dollars they wasted

#s121
Well maybe they run

#s122
I do n't know you know

#s123
that 's just guessing it

#s124
Maybe they run a lot of other tests

#s125
or maybe it 's under a health type program that it it it would catch a lot of things

#s128
I I just ca n't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them
