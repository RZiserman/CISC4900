Uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers

#s2
And we keep the newspapers in a in a

#s3
they 're collected twice a month and the trash and and this bottled stuff that is put in a in a little blue bin that 's picked up and sorted out into a truck

#s4
So they ma- actually have about three passes at this collection One for the regular trash one for the uh uh you know the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers

#s7
No

#s8
they they do that on the truck

#s10
They separate them as they as they you know dump them

#s11
And you know one guy comes around with his truck and and dumps it all in there

#s12
And I think they 're they 're running out of uh you know

#s13
The sanitary landfill I think uh is you know running out

#s14
Of course uh you being from New Mexico you 've probably been n- to Washington Especially if you 're your present location

#s16
You must have come to Washington at least once

#s24
My you 've got a lot a a lot of nothing out there You know

#s26
they got

#s27
I mean there there 's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could you could use for landfill MUMBLEx

#s30
Well what other we- we- what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what in Los Alamos

#s32
Uh other other than nuking it

#s37
Well is n't that a that 's a that 's pretty uh upscale uh trash uh uh situation

#s38
I do n't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals

#s41
Huh

#s44


#
Huh

#s48
Well that 's certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things

#s49
I I think it should be i- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy

#s50
you y- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know

#s51
Uh but more than that every week uh you 've got to pay by the pound

#s52
I I think I think people would be would get very very you know they 'd be very careful about how they bought stuff

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Uh-huh

#s60
Well of course that uh you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
