What kind of woodworking do you do

#s9
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh well I like to think of it as a hobby

#s14
but I I guess also partly out of necessity Just repairing things around the house

#s15
Uh a few years ago uh we needed uh they needed some book shelves

#s16
and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves

#s17
and uh it actually worked pretty well

#s18
and over the years I 've I 've refined those plans

#s19
I got myself a router

#s20
and I 'm I 'm very good at making book shelves

#s22
It 's it 's also a way of relieving stress

#s23
My wife kind of laughs at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we 've got more book shelves

#s33
Uh well yeah

#s34
I mean little by little

#s35
I I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things

#s37
Uh gotten a a good belt sander

#s38
and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router

#s40
The latest project that I 've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a a cabinet to to put a T V in

#s42
Right

#s44
And it that 's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipment you have

#s45
so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment

#s49
And uh that 's worked pretty well

#s50
Uh with uh with the router you can make nice uh

#s51
I guess dado joints is what it 's called

#s57
Uh And it 's uh

#s59
That 's right

#s60
That 's right

#s61
So

#s64
But what I need next is a good table saw

#s66
And I I debate whether it 's better to get a uh just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws

#s68
Radial arm saw is I guess what they 're called

#s70
Uh it t- seems to me the radial arm saw is is better

#s71
well it it takes up less room

#s73
I mean you you set the wood down

#s74
and you move the saw

#s76
Whereas if you 're ripping wood you 're probably better off with a a table saw

#s80
Yeah

#s82
Uh that that 's partly my problem now

#s83
I do n't have room for this

#s84
I uh I

#s85
where uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common

#s87
and I used to put all the stuff in my basement

#s88
but not so here in Texas

#s96
Yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s108
Have you ever used a lathe
