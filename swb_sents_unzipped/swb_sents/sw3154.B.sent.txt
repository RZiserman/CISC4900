Okay

#s2
Well let 's see

#s3
well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and glass and uh plastics

#s4
and uh we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they 're full

#s5
I guess we collect m- milk cartons and whatever p- other plastics are acceptable

#s7
No

#s8
no

#s9
I did n't think that anybody had those at all yet

#s13
Right

#s14
Well no

#s15
I have n't seen any

#s16
so I I thought that it all had all been delayed several times

#s17
So I have no idea what they look like

#s18
and I 'm kind of anxious to see them

#s25
Oh right

#s31
Right

#s32
Right

#s35
Oh

#s36
Oh of course

#s37
That they did

#s38
You know actually we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles

#s40
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house

#s42
You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed

#s44
and so you just put the empty ones back out there

#s45
and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there

#s47
So uh yeah

#s51
Right

#s52
right

#s53
it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here

#s54
It seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away

#s55
so I hope that this time it it stays

#s56
Just To see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing

#s58
So uh you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them

#s59
seems like there 's a pretty well there 's a p- pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics

#s61
so that 's kind of encouraging

#s62
I did n't know you know I did n't know if we started to do that

#s63
I did n't know what to expect

#s66
Right

#s70
Well I guess they will shortly

#s71
I uh

#s74
Oh right

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Right

#s79
Do you know I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday I saw the return to the uh the small Coke bottles

#s81
And I do n't know if there 's a deposit on those or not

#s85
They were glass they were the glass uh

#s86
well let 's see

#s87
they 'd be I do n't know maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce Sort of a small size sort of a small size

#s88
and and we anyway we just we did n't stop and look them look at them a long time

#s91
but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down you know uh sort of sort of a basket type thing

#s94
Right

#s95
right

#s96
so I had n't seen that in a long time

#s103
Yeah

#s104
yeah

#s105
well

#s107
No

#s108
he does n't like the paper sacks

#s109
and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too

#s110
He does n't Does n't

#s118
Right

#s119
right

#s121
That 's nice

#s122
I guess they dump it the same place

#s123
I wonder where they dump that

#s134
Yeah

#s135
yeah

#s136
well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in

#s138
They have this day now that it 's you know separate from the other trash pick up

#s143
No
