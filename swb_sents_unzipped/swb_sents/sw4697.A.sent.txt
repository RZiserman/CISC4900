#s1
Well th- the question was talking about the juries

#s2
and uh one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that uh

#s3
maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again

#s4
Uh so that uh a judge I think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day

#s7
Right

#s9
Right

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Yeah

#s14
See I agree with you

#s15
Uh one thing I heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court

#s16
I mean it 's supposed to be all legal and everything

#s17
Uh you go

#s18
and you present your case

#s19
the other side presents their case

#s20
and you 're done with it

#s21
It 's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V

#s23
Uh and uh but it 's not that we have uh such

#s24
it did n't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending

#s25
Uh so I

#s26
that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way

#s29
Yes

#s30
Yes

#s31
Now

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Sure

#s42
Oh yes

#s43
and and I was n't I did n't mean that

#s46
I I did n't mean that

#s47
no

#s48
Because I mean gee whiz if I was uh uh did n't have that right you know not to have a jury that

#s49
oh

#s50
yes

#s51
I would feel uh you 're right that my civil rights had been violated

#s52
But I meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we 're going to have a judge here

#s53
We 're not going to have a jury you know

#s54
let 's get it over with

#s55
Sort of like car accidents you know

#s58
Yeah

#s62
Right

#s63
right

#s65
Uh-huh

#s68
Right

#s69
Giving a different sentence

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
The take

#s72
Right

#s77
Well I I i- we 're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it 's all on the same theme

#s79
Uh-huh

#s83
Right

#s84
Right

#s87
Uh-huh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s90
Uh-huh

#s94
Right

#s95
Right

#s96
Yeah

#s97
bu- well you can tell I have n't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that

#s99
N-

#s100
well I was called once when I was nineteen

#s102
and uh but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me

#s103
and I was doing school and things like

#s104
they they let me out

#s106
An- I 've never had to it since

#s107
and that was almost twenty years ago

#s113
Uh-huh

#s118
Uh-huh

#s121
Huh

#s123
How interesting

#s126
Uh-huh

#s127
Uh-huh
