#s3
Yeah

#s4
I at first I

#s5
it took eight times to find you

#s6
so I told my husband uh you know

#s7
what should I say

#s8
and then he reminded me

#s9
but uh uh hi- in his family uh what they usually do on his dad 's side his mom or uh the aunts will send out little postcards like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the the where to meet and you know just to bring anything

#s10
and so they just notify everyone by mail

#s11
and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short uh or a small uh dinner type thing

#s14
Uh they come from well they all meet in Portland

#s15
and they come as far as oh Seattle

#s16
and and sometimes we 've gone

#s17
and we were f- we were living in Utah at the time

#s19
And uh the his his dad 's family is all around the area

#s20
and his mom 's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern Utah

#s21
and people would come from Seattle to there and uh let 's see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah

#s22
and they would uh assign a different person each time they had a reunion they 'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody

#s26
Yeah

#s27
yeah

#s28
and the people who are down there like they 'll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area

#s29
and that person can call you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too

#s31
And then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone 's sort of involved

#s35
Oh well that 's my husband 's side

#s36
and my mom my mom 's or my family uh we all live in southern California

#s37
so we just have to either or give a formal invite

#s38
and we 're all there

#s39
so

#s41
Yeah

#s42
well I mean L A Orange County area

#s43
I mean everyone 's you know mostly not farther than an hour away

#s48
Uh-huh

#s52
Oh

#s54
Wow

#s64
Well you know that 's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband 's mother 's side together is uh they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time

#s65
and uh inevitably everyone is just very interested

#s66
and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know

#s67
someone 's been born

#s68
or someone passed away

#s69
or you know something like that

#s71
and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever

#s73
Uh I do but not to very much compared to my mother-in-law

#s79
Um

#s83
Oh

#s86
Really

#s87
Is it your your grandma 's own sibling

#s88
and she

#s91
Oh I see

#s92
Oh so

#s95
Well maybe uh they just moved away and then sort of lost contact
