#s1
Well this is a subject that you never think you 'll be assigned to One that kind of comes up when you 've lost it the others other subjects

#s3
Um as I was sitting there I thought the weather 's been perfect

#s4
I do n't know much to say about it

#s5
It 's uh it 's you know

#s6
for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous

#s8
Are you

#s9
It could n't have been better

#s11
I mean it did n't foul one launch

#s12
and that 's kind of unusual

#s13
and it 's kind of cold in the mornings

#s14
so you dress up warm

#s15
but by

#s17
That 's the only thing wrong I can find with it

#s20
Oh how fun

#s22
I miss that

#s23
yeah

#s28
Yeah

#s30
Yeah

#s34
Ooh

#s36
I guess you have to take some things and leave some things

#s38
Yeah

#s39
I 'm from Utah area

#s40
and they you know they have tons of canyons where the leaves change

#s41
and they 're gorgeous

#s43
you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area

#s50
Yeah

#s51
it 's kind of hazardous for driving

#s53
that 's for sure

#s54
But I ca n't complain

#s55
I do n't know if I 've been spoiled

#s56
I 've been thinking it 's getting cold sooner than normal

#s57
We 've only lived here a couple of years

#s60
Huh

#s62
We 'll have to see how it goes

#s63
a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal

#s64
but then we 're back to being warmer than normal this week or last week

#s65
so

#s67
I do n't have to live through many any of those really

#s68
a bad

#s69
I mean nothing comparable I guess to what you 've had before

#s75
You 're right

#s77
Well they get ice

#s78
and no one can drive on ice

#s80
I mean we used to think they were pansies

#s81
but then when you decided what ice was

#s84
So well I think we 've discussed it good enough today

#s86
It was It was good talking to you

#s88
Maybe we 'll get the next time

#s90
Take care

#s92
Bye-bye
