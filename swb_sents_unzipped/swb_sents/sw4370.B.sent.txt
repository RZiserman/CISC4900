#s2
Uh I certainly ca n't argue with that

#s3
Definitely does need some improvements

#s4
Uh

#s5
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to

#s9
I think it 's Four or five

#s11
I ca n't remember which

#s12
I was on a jury trial last year

#s13
only I got kicked out as uh the last selection that the uh defense got

#s17
Um

#s19
That uh

#s22
Right

#s23
but it still has to be a group of your peers

#s25
See

#s27
So if it 's your peers and you 're not educated then

#s29
You want you want a nincompoop jury because they 'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them

#s31
So that 's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant

#s33
So uh I think the jury selection process is pretty neat

#s34
but I do n't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards

#s36
I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have

#s37
M- you 're talking about the person 's already been found guilty right

#s40
and many times I 've seen on trials they have on T V

#s41
the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever

#s42
but I think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be

#s44
Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who know what the system is and what it 's all about and believe in the system

#s48
Uh and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure Also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure

#s51
Well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime

#s52
But when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person 's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they 're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side

#s53
and the jury 's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury

#s57
At least in California they 're supposed to be

#s58
Not during the trial

#s59
during the trial as to whether they 're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background

#s61
But when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going to lay down I think that uh that they should

#s63
I do n't I do n't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial

#s64
They get too boring

#s67
Well if it 's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time

#s69
So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better

#s70
When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing I 'm all for that for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant

#s71
you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things

#s73
I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are

#s75
Yeah

#s77
Well uh say embezzlement right

#s79
You get a guy down the street who comes up uh carrying a kni-
