#s1
seems to be a a topic that 's going to probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two

#s2
And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up

#s3
Uh it does seem to be a lot of habits to break

#s4
I uh was n't raised as a kid on it

#s5
but my kids are

#s6
and so they they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do

#s7
and we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out

#s8
and they were n't worth anything anymore

#s10
And we

#s11
it took us almost a year to get a garbage sack full

#s12
We just do n't drink that many

#s13
So as far as at home use uh we 'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something

#s14
and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in uh

#s15
at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound

#s16
and we came out with about a dollar

#s17
it just really was n't worth it

#s20
Yeah

#s22
So they they realized you know

#s23
well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old

#s24
That was n't uh that was a big deal

#s25
but we decided it was n't worth us keeping it

#s26
and then uh T I started keeping up with uh cans there

#s27
so occasionally I 'll bring whatever I 've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there

#s28
Least it gets back into the system

#s29
but as far as a habit at the house uh I have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up

#s30
Have you all got the individual containers yet

#s35
Um

#s39
Right

#s40
Yeah

#s41
it seemed like uh

#s42
if if I recall it 's been a long time

#s43
They 're way behind schedule on that particular part of it

#s44
They were fine on the green big green containers

#s46
but uh seems like they said they were just going to have a bin and all different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed

#s48
It it seemed that there was

#s49
at the time anyway it the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at at the collection sites where everything 's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting

#s50
But when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses uh

#s51
the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor

#s52
so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than than having a household try it

#s54
But I I do n't know

#s55
that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week 's worth of trash for a house

#s57
Yeah

#s58
yeah

#s61
Right

#s62
That 's true

#s66
Right

#s72
Yeah

#s73
They do n't do that

#s74
We live next to a set of railroad tracks

#s75
and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them

#s77
but uh they were n't that successful

#s78
so there were a lot of bottles to be returned

#s79
and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day

#s81
and

#s86
Yeah

#s87
just a little bit of begging will

#s92
Right

#s93
Well I wonder

#s98
Yeah

#s100
Right

#s101
yeah

#s103
Where do you take your cans
