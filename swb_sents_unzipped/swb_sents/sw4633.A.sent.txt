#s2
Well I have five

#s4
Right

#s6
Well five are I mean four of them are grown

#s7
they 're in college or just out of college

#s8
so I really have just a thirteen year old at home

#s11
Well I work at it

#s14
I try to fool everybody

#s17
Uh-huh

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
I think you are right

#s25
because I was an only child too

#s26
And that 's one reason I have so many because I really I enjoy the big family

#s28
And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters

#s29
and so she is sort of like an only child

#s30
and it 's the same type of thing uh

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s40
Right

#s41
That 's exactly how it is you know

#s42
She 's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her

#s43
When things do n't go right she just calls one of them you know

#s45
But uh yeah

#s46
it it 's a little bit difficult though

#s47
I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more

#s48
And

#s50
We we really did not

#s51
My next oldest daughter that 's in college in California is a world twirling champion

#s52
She twirls a baton

#s53
and we did a lot of things together

#s55
She and I did a lot of things together and flew

#s56
we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform

#s58
And that was a lot of fun

#s59
But that that I guess you could consider that organized

#s60
I mean there is a competition all the time

#s62
We were very heavy into that

#s63
Other than that they were pretty much

#s64
and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that

#s68
Uh-huh

#s70
Well you ca n't afford to

#s74
Right

#s81
Right

#s82
That 's right

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
Yeah

#s88
Well I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter

#s89
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice

#s90
She had to go with me

#s92
So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing

#s93
and of course the competing itself really did n't matter what it was

#s94
it was making the friends and going all the places

#s95
and it was a really neat experience

#s96
but it took our total time

#s97
I did not work uh when I did this

#s98
Now I do work full-time

#s100
And it 's just my thirteen year old and myself

#s101
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other

#s102
So

#s108
Yeah

#s119
Really

#s121
Well things cost a lot more

#s122
I do n't know how it is in Georgia

#s124
and I do n't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some

#s126
Is it

#s130
Really

#s134
Right

#s135
That 's what I 've heard

#s141
Huh

#s142
Yeah

#s145
I 'm surprised to hear that

#s146
I 've heard very positive things about Atlanta
