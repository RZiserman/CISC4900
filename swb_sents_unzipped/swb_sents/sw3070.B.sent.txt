Does your family normally have a reunion

#s2
Do you have one

#s4
that 's been

#s6
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s12
Right

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
Well it might be a good time for you to be- to to start a tradition

#s19
You could be responsible for that yourself

#s22
Sure

#s24
Well in my family let 's see last October was the forty fifth annual uh reunion

#s27
The first Sunday in October the Jordan family gets together

#s29
And all of the descendants of the Civil War I mean yeah the Civil War veterans come together

#s30
and they come as far away from California

#s31
and there 's usually oh between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people

#s33
Uh there 's a big community hall in Vernon Texas

#s35
and uh that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Right

#s41
uh-huh

#s42
A lot of the older family lives in Vernon

#s44
Um all of his direct descendants descendants have now died

#s45
and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties

#s47
So we 're talking about second and third great children here

#s49
Uh I take my boys well I took them up until this year

#s50
they 're grown and gone from home now

#s52
so they they take their family

#s54
But uh let 's see

#s55
that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather

#s56
okay

#s57
so it would be the second great grandchild

#s58
And so they

#s61
Well it 's a community center it 's a community hall

#s62
It 's a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in

#s64
and uh you just bring the covered dishes

#s65
Every every family brings a a dish of some kind

#s66
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years

#s69
Well we try to stay away from those things which might have uh salmonella in them

#s71
And we choose to bring congealed salad

#s72
You can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad

#s74
And we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of of uh sanitation aspects whatever you 've got to carry for any distance

#s76
I always take home baked bread

#s78
Uh that happens to be my specialty for that family

#s79
I do other things very well

#s81
but there are others in the family who do them better

#s83
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s90
Uh-huh

#s92
Uh-huh

#s94
Uh-huh

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
Right

#s112
Well it 's uh

#s113
we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization

#s115
and they plan the reunions

#s116
the organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who 's going to rent the tables who 's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer

#s117
Uh and each year it 's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles

#s119
We have a biographer who who continues every year to save clippings on any family member

#s120
and they 're entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone

#s121
And it keeps the family alive even you know even though it 's very fluid

#s124
And they 're very dedicated to that

#s125
and uh it 's been really wonderful

#s126
It helps you hang onto your roots

#s129
And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging

#s130
My husband on the other hand was not very close to his family

#s131
His family was very scattered and very diverse

#s133
And I asked him I got to talking to him

#s134
I said well how is his nephew doing

#s135
Well I do n't know

#s136
I have n't talked to my brother in three years

#s137
I said Well how 's your brother doing

#s138
I do n't know

#s139
Uh you know my son keeps in touch with him I think

#s140
but I do n't

#s142
I said Hey would n't you like to know what 's happening with these people

#s143
Yeah

#s144
but I 'm you know

#s145
it 's too much trouble

#s146
So I got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family And succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at Lake Tawakoni

#s150
Liked to kill me because I ha- it was I did n't have that group cooperation

#s151
I did it by myself

#s153
And uh nobody brought covered dishes

#s154
We had a great big fish fry

#s155
and you know I fixed a salad in a number three tub

#s157
And and uh it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping

#s158
And uh we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them

#s159
and I told him

#s161
We did it that year

#s162
and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there

#s163
We sent invitations

#s164
We said Please let us know if you 're coming

#s165
It was when uh his mother his step father had died the year before

#s167
and it

#s168
his mother was alone

#s169
and so they came to support her

#s170
and then one by one his broth- you know his sisters he began to lose family members

#s173
and it was difficult to hold them together

#s174
And then of course he died two years ago

#s175
so you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now

#s177
And uh it

#s178
I think that 's what happens when they get scattered

#s179
the the family unit you know falls into disrepair

#s183
Uh-huh

#s185
Uh-huh

#s187
Uh-huh

#s190
Uh-huh

#s191
Well see we manage those people who are at that core group manage to keep keep the vigor alive

#s192
They 'll send out news bulletins

#s193
Two or three times a year you 'll get a news bull-

#s194
hey guess who got you know elected to the legislature

#s195
or guess who our local sheriff
