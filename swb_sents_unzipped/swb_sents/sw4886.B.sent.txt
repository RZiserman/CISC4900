#s2
No

#s3
I 'm not in the middle of anything

#s4
I 've just

#s5
about the last thing I did

#s6
about maybe oh close to a year ago now I guess I I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house

#s7
So I guess that

#s9
Yeah

#s10
That that was fairly large undertaking

#s11
A a it 's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house

#s13
Oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking

#s15
That was the only thing we did n't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that

#s16
we do n't we we were n't sure how to do that

#s17


#
Yeah

#s21
that 's the exact opposite

#s22
We did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up

#s23
We just did n't do any of the sheetrock wall work

#s24
and that 's it because you have you know get those joints to go together

#s26
and whatever you have to put in there to get the s- to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that

#s28
I di- we did n't know a thing about any of that

#s29
and so

#s31
It 's it looked very hard to do

#s32
so

#s33
we figured well just

#s34
I did n't think we could do it and make it look professional

#s35
So we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living

#s36
But

#s38
Probably so

#s39
and I we 'd never done it

#s40
so we just left it alone

#s42
But that 's

#s43
I guess

#s44
I 'm only twenty-one

#s45
so I my my vast experience of home home owner 's knowledge is not very much

#s46
So it 's just what I have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents

#s47
so

#s50
It was brand new

#s53
We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house

#s54
so it was

#s56
Uh well my dad knew how to do most of it you know

#s58
He he 'd we 'd gotten a couple of books

#s59
and then he just started doing it

#s60
I do n't know

#s61
He well he did all the flooring himself

#s62
He put the whole the whole floor in

#s63
and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there

#s64
And then we were put a like a not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that

#s65
after we had the house part made we just decided we 'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less

#s66
It 's not you know it 's not enclosed

#s67
It 's just somewhere to drive another car to to park

#s68
and it 's

#s71
Uh it 's off the ground

#s73
Uh-huh

#s74
It 's on about uh twenty-two inch piers something like that

#s77
So

#s79
Uh no

#s80
those those are

#s81
we did those ourselves

#s82
so

#s84
Yeah

#s86
Exactly

#s87
so It 's

#s89
Yeah

#s90
those ar- those are

#s91
we 'd I 've done one

#s92
I helped somebody do one of those before

#s93
Those are those are you know

#s94
you can buy them in kits

#s95
but we did n't do that way

#s96
But it 's

#s100
Yeah

#s105
Yeah

#s106
yeah

#s107
That 's not near like building a house or anything

#s108
but

#s110
Yeah

#s111
those are nice

#s112
Especially when you get done you 've got something you know

#s113
I do n't know

#s114
I like them

#s115
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever Have a barbecue

#s118
or

#s120
Yeah

#s121
that sounds nice

#s122
All done by yourself

#s123
huh

#s126
Designed

#s129
Yeah

#s135
Yeah

#s136
That 's pretty that 's a good size deck

#s138
So yeah

#s139
That 's

#s142
Yeah

#s143
That 's not

#s145
Yeah

#s146
that 's good

#s147
That 's not bad at all

#s148
Did n't have to

#s150
th- the wood may

#s151
it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know

#s152
To get to get good lumber it costs

#s153
I do n't know about Dallas

#s154
but arou- even in this little town it 's it 's not cheap at all

#s155
I was surprised

#s157
It 's probably more there

#s160
Yeah

#s161
yeah

#s162
that it probably does

#s164
I I 'm not sure

#s165
but

#s167
Yeah

#s168
It 's nothing but woods up here down here

#s169
Yeah

#s170
I do n't I have n't I mean I have n't

#s171
I used to live in Dallas In Arlington actually

#s173
And but that was just when I was a kid

#s174
so I do n't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore

#s175
But it 's I do n't know

#s176
we 're a college town

#s177
so that does n't help us out any

#s180
MUMBLEx

#s181
We have

#s182
gas is a dollar t- dollar twelve a gallon

#s183
so that 's probably about what you 're paying

#s185
so

#s189
Yeah

#s191
You 've got something going all the time
