#s2
Oh boy probably uh robberies people stealing from each other

#s4
Is that what happens up there a lot

#s5
Uh th- that that 's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen

#s6
That 's the most prevalent crime Uh the ones that really you know the ones that really add up after a while I guess you know from s- far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs

#s7
You know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually

#s12
Oh well yeah

#s13
that that that is a crime

#s14
I guess uh when you when you count all the little things that people do like

#s15
uh speeding is a crime

#s17
I break that law every day

#s19
Uh-huh

#s23
Well I 've uh I 've been caught with marijuana before

#s24
so I guess that was a crime

#s25
I got a year 's probation for that

#s26
but uh

#s29
No

#s30
it was n't that big a deal

#s32
Uh when I think of crime I think of stuff that that affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped

#s33
I think rape is one of the worst crimes

#s37
Yeah

#s38
it 's very degrading

#s40
and Yeah

#s43
Yeah

#s44
right

#s45
once once a person 's you know gone then it 's

#s46
but the person that 's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life you know

#s49
Well for for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is

#s50
it 's a pretty good thing

#s52
They they have that down here in Florida still

#s53
They the electric chair

#s54
and uh

#s57
Oh do they

#s58
Yeah

#s59
I think I think that 's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy

#s60
and I guess usually they 're they 're always sure they got the right guy

#s61
but uh

#s64
Yeah

#s65
so do I

#s67
Yeah

#s68
i- if that

#s69
You know the sooner

#s70
a a a year 's plenty of time you know for something to come out I guess

#s72
Then you know there 's been guys in jail for six years

#s73
and the other guy admits that he did it

#s74
and they

#s75
it 's like oops

#s76
But

#s77
Uh-huh

#s83
Right

#s86
Um yeah

#s87
I do n't know if it would or not though

#s88
I I do n't think it 's a so much of a deterrent as as it is a a good uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members

#s89
you know what I mean

#s91
Yeah

#s93
Yeah

#s94
it kind of gets it off their chest

#s99
Yeah

#s100
I know that a a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other

#s103
And they 're the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that

#s104
I do n't think you 'll ever stop all that stuff dead

#s105
but I y- y- you might be able to uh stop people you know

#s106
they 're thinking about it

#s107
they know they 're going to get the chair if they get caught

#s110
Right

#s113
Yeah

#s115
That 's right

#s117
Yeah

#s118
Yeah

#s119
they could p- probably do it again

#s122
That 's right

#s123
they did n't have any time doing it the first time

#s126
No

#s127
it do-
