Are you in the middle of anything

#s8
The whole thing

#s12
Did the framing and all

#s14
Huh

#s18
Maybe you and I should get together Because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing

#s19
and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work

#s25
Ye-

#s27
Yeah

#s30
My wife wishes I had n't done that

#s37
I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy

#s41
Yeah

#s48
Did you you framed it in f- uh on on you framed in new square footage

#s49
or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed

#s51
Brand new

#s52
MUMBLEx

#s55
A- and you knew how you knew how to do the framing

#s57
Uh-huh

#s69
Do do you build on slabs down there

#s70
or did you build it up off the ground

#s72
On the piers

#s75
Did

#s76
You had those poured

#s78
or you did them yourself

#s83
You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete

#s85
Huh

#s88
Well the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of

#s97
No

#s98
I designed it from scratch and did it

#s99
did a pretty good job

#s101
Those are nice

#s102
They 're pretty forgiving you know

#s103
You can always tear stuff out and redo it

#s104
It 's a

#s109
Right

#s116
Yeah

#s117
I I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff

#s119
I

#s124
Yeah

#s125
I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes

#s127
so we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts

#s128
And uh and then the rest of it I just did

#s130
A a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the uh foundation work

#s131
but uh it was pretty

#s132
it was about four or five hundred square feet

#s133
The same size as the addition that I just put on

#s134
so

#s137
Yeah

#s140
It 's uh not that expensive

#s141
I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know no less than that

#s144
Co- cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together

#s149
Yeah

#s156
I 'd be surprised if it was n't uh cheaper where you are

#s158
Well yeah

#s159
It probably comes from where you are

#s163
Most

#s166
When I drive through that area that 's all I see is pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards

#s172
Uh-huh

#s178
Right

#s179
East Texas

#s184
Huh

#s186
Yeah

#s187
my current project is a walkway which I 'm building around the house and out to the backyard to uh you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that

#s188
so

#s190
That 's a lot easier
