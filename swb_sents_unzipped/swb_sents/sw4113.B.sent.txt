#s2
Generally I do n't think they are

#s3
Uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they 're entrenched

#s5
They do n't ever have to go out and get a real job

#s6
They just stay in their current job

#s8
you know what I mean

#s11
I think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems

#s13
Uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too

#s14
I know some senators

#s15
and I do n't know which ones

#s16
but they 've been in office since the the nineteen forties

#s18
and I

#s19
th- they 've never had a job

#s20
I mean they 've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes

#s22
I know they pay taxes

#s23
but they do n't

#s25
you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit

#s27
and you know I 'm going like I I do n't understand how they 're supposed to be my servants and yet they 're paid more than I am

#s29
and they work less you know less than I do

#s33
I think I think that 's true

#s34
however I think that 's always been true

#s36
I mean that 's true of the Presidency too

#s37
and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years

#s38
And uh

#s41
They

#s42
I mean there is a lot to learn

#s43
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up

#s44
I think two years is too short

#s46
I think it would have to be extended uh you know

#s47
a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms

#s48
or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman

#s49
Uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for Congress Senate and the the Presidency and then uh staggering them so that you do n't

#s51
we are n't tackling a massive ballot every four years

#s58
Uh-huh

#s59
I think I think that that 's true

#s60
but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin

#s62
Uh the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency

#s63
I mean the action is n't in West Virginia

#s64
I hate to tell the s- the senator from West Virginia this information

#s65
but it really does n't ar-

#s68
the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh as far as this country is concerned

#s69
the world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics

#s71
and the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency

#s72
and to have it located out in West Virginia

#s73
yeah

#s74
you know it might only be two hour drive from here

#s75
but that 's a two hour drive

#s77
and uh you know it it 's a I think it 's a mistake to move large agencies like that

#s79
or is it the F B I

#s80
I do n't remember

#s81
but I think there 's

#s85
Yeah

#s86
that 's officially

#s88
I mean we all know that that 's not necessarily true

#s89
But I I think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh turn- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years

#s90
I think there are I mean there 's an institutional memory that you need to maintain

#s92
But I think that uh all with all the perks that we 've given them

#s93
I mean I heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago uh during the incidents where they were you know like they are n't paying their their restaurant bills and they 're bouncing checks all over the place

#s96
uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
