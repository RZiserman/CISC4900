#s1
Uh well uh the Cowboys are my favorite team

#s2
That 's pretty easy to say nowadays

#s3
Lot easier than it was a couple years ago

#s4
but they had a big win today

#s5
Uh did you get to watch it

#s10
Oh

#s11
Are you a Cowboy fan

#s15
Right

#s16
yeah

#s18
Uh-huh

#s20
Right

#s22
Yeah

#s24
Right

#s25
Right

#s28
Yeah

#s29
they made it to the playoffs finally

#s30
like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen

#s31
They won like just one game

#s32
and so pretty fast turnaround

#s33
But this year they made it to playoffs

#s34
and today was the first game

#s35
and they beat the Chicago Bears

#s36
so everybody 's really going crazy you know down here

#s38
They 're going crazy

#s39
so so they turned it around

#s40
but you know they have a lot of young exciting players now uh

#s41
I mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired Tom Landry

#s42
but you know now it 's like you know they 're doing good

#s43
so everybody 's forgotten about that

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Right

#s50
Right

#s51
exactly You know

#s53
Uh-huh

#s54
Right

#s55
yeah

#s56
uh you know they have a young team

#s57
It 's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it 's the same old you know players every year and you know same coach same everything

#s58
so now it 's you know like a taste of something different

#s59
They 're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be

#s60
Now it 's like you know tough and dirty team

#s61
so everybody is really excited

#s62
And

#s64
Well it 's supposed to be the Redskins

#s65
but you know we beat them already

#s66
We beat them this year in in Washington

#s67
so you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl

#s68
but you know it 's just that we have to play every game away you know

#s69
it 's going to be tough

#s70
but but every-

#s71
the competition is are teams that they 've already beat this year

#s72
so I mean Atlanta they 're in it too

#s73
and we beat them

#s74
and uh see Detroit we play them next week

#s75
but you know we should beat them

#s76
Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them

#s77
so it 's so everything 's uh looking real good

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
Right

#s82
Right

#s83
Right

#s84
Yeah

#s85
well the Cowboys are on a roll

#s86
They 've won like I think six or seven in a row now

#s87
so they 're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the playoffs

#s88
so

#s90
Right

#s91
yeah

#s92
