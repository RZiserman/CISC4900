Okay

#s2
I guess we 're supposed to discuss the uh school system

#s3
That should n't be too much trouble for the two of us Right

#s7
Right

#s10
Uh-huh

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
That 's really sad is n't it

#s17
Right

#s18
Well just recently in the paper here were articles about students uh working High school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades

#s20
But then the follow-up the next day was

#s21
I was kind of glad to see

#s22
because it it said that you know

#s23
yes

#s24
but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible You know and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors

#s26
You know like what are their plans after high school you know

#s27
And what 's their home situation

#s28
You know that

#s30
Right

#s32
Right

#s35
Right

#s36
Sure

#s38
But there can still be an attitude of

#s40
you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now

#s41
but but that the most important thing is still you know getting your education

#s43
Well when they meant said the the topic you know of what 's wrong with the public schools my my first im- impulse was it is n't really what 's wrong with the public public schools

#s44
It 's what 's wrong with families

#s48
And society in general

#s49
Right

#s53
Right

#s55
Right

#s58
Right

#s60
Yeah

#s62
Huh

#s63
Yeah

#s65
Well we 've got uh you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids

#s66
and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor

#s67
And that 's just really not enough

#s70
And I was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school

#s71
and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that 's when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that

#s72
But you know part of my feeling is that if you solve help them to work through their problems while they 're littler then they wo n't have as many problems up there

#s77
Really

#s82
Yeah

#s84
Uh-huh

#s85
They they do that here

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s91
To change

#s92
yeah

#s94
Right

#s97
Yes

#s98
it certainly is

#s100
Yeah

#s101
That 's right

#s105
Yeah

#s107
Right

#s109
I 'm on that um campus strategic planning committee for my school

#s111
And uh one of the uh you know oh

#s112
they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things

#s113
But anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value

#s114
Then I think they decided to strike economic

#s116
Anyway you know the point was what happens when public education fails

#s117
You know will then people go to private schools

#s119
You know well what kind of a situation do they get there

#s120
and what are you know

#s121
and what kind of state are we in if if most people are going to private schools

#s123
Right

#s125
Right

#s126
Uh-huh

#s129
That 's right

#s130
That 's right

#s132
Uh-huh

#s133
Uh-huh

#s135
Uh-huh

#s136
Yeah

#s138
and one of the Plano school district 's you know goals is that they will graduate every child that uh that is here in the ninth grade

#s139
I believe it 's something like that

#s141
it 's worded

#s142
And uh I do n't know

#s144
Right

#s146
That 's so important

#s149
Oh gosh

#s150
Well that new movie That new movie out

#s152
I um

#s153
really really a frightening situation

#s155
I guess we 're both lucky To be in situations and schools where we do n't see that

#s156
My folks talk about it a lot in Illinois

#s157
My mother was is was teacher for years and years

#s158
and uh they live in Peoria Illinois

#s159
and they 're talking a lot about the you know the school situation there too

#s160
So well shall we wrap it up

#s162
I think we have to

#s164
So I 'll see you when we see you

#s167
Uh-huh

#s172
Oh how exciting

#s173
Is n't that wonderful

#s174
Oh that is wonderful

#s176
