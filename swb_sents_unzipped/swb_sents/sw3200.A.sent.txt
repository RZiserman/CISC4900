Okay

#s2
I 'll let you start

#s3
Do you all keep a budget

#s4
and how do you hold to yours

#s8
Well that 's that 's good

#s10
Especially for these times

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Well that 's a lot of it

#s14
Uh I know we tried several different ways

#s15
One time we tried something that really worked

#s16
but we did n't keep it up

#s17
I passed it on to a friend

#s18
and she wo n't quit doing it

#s19
She loves it

#s20
and that was the envelope system Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend

#s22
and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that

#s23
So you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera

#s24
And then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form uh causes you to realize how much is left

#s25
And she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she 's buying

#s27
And then at the end of the of the period pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment

#s29
And they kind of work it that way

#s30
We tried for a while

#s31
and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we could n't think about

#s33
And those are the ones that will kill you

#s34
You know the accid- the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that were n't supposed to be every month

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
That 's what I mean

#s40
It was a hassle

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
That 's that 's kind of hard

#s50
But do you sort of self budget even

#s51
I mean you would n't like on payday think boy I can go do this and that and this and that

#s52
You kind of think this is got to str-

#s54
you kind of divide it in fourths in a way do n't you

#s57
Right

#s59
Right

#s62
Well that 's true

#s63
What we 're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely

#s65
And we 're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month

#s68
Oh

#s70
Yeah

#s71
we 're not there yet

#s73
Uh-huh

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
That 's right

#s77
That 's right

#s81
Huh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
same here

#s85
Uh-huh

#s88
Well I could say it 's kind of

#s89
you know that 's that 's good

#s90
You ma- you probably have a little extra than you have to have to

#s91
you know what I 'm saying

#s93
And so that that 's the difference there where sometimes like I know if we 've had an especially bad month and we 're just almost getting down to payday then I think if we could really budget

#s94
we tried one tim-

#s95
I know when we were planning to buy the new car and we had n't had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was going to be left

#s98
and that was a real eye opener

#s101
Uh-huh

#s102
But to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes I 'll spend less on groceries but we 'll go out

#s103
So it 's kind of hard to say this is how much you 're going to spend going out for fun

#s104
This is how much you 're going to spend

#s105
It 's kind of hard

#s107
Do you

#s109
Yeah

#s110
yeah

#s111
Right

#s112
Right

#s114
Oh

#s116
How nice

#s117
Uh-huh

#s121
W-

#s122
Well that 's

#s124
and it made a big

#s125
and you enjoyed it better probably

#s127
Yeah

#s130
I think so too

#s133
So if you 're out like in a department store and there 's a sale you 're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you

#s135
That 's that 's excellent

#s136
That 's what I 'm working toward

#s137
I think you 're probably much ahead of me there

#s138
and I 'm working on it

#s142
Same here

#s143
same here

#s145
And I think though that we need to have some liquid around that you do n't have to go through the company to get

#s147
You know

#s149
Yeah

#s151
That came up

#s152
Yeah

#s155
Uh-huh

#s157
Well that 's the best thing to do

#s158
My husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it was n't worth it from the day after

#s161
So

#s163
Rather frugal

#s164
Well that 's that 's going to payoff on retirement

#s165
Yeah

#s167
Well it uh

#s168
I guess we 've completed

#s169
do you think we 've been here to in-
