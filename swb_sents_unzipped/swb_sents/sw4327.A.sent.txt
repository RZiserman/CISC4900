#s1
Right

#s2
uh actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years

#s3
I lived in Germany

#s4
and in Germany they do n't have the jury system

#s5
What they do is they have uh three judges basically

#s6
And you get up there

#s7
and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence

#s8
and your defense attorney presents their evidence

#s9
and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you 're guilty or not

#s15
Uh-huh

#s19
Wow

#s22
Well you know it 's it 's one of those things

#s23
I mean uh uh I would have to look at it

#s24
I- if they did it with the uh just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight

#s25
because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures

#s26
they know what 's good and what is n't

#s27
they 'd be able to say I 'm sorry

#s28
you ca n't use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever

#s29
and you know you would n't have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury

#s30
and then the judge says oh no

#s31
d- disregard that

#s32
Come on

#s33
any jury 's not going to disregard the evidence you know

#s36
That may very well be

#s38
Uh

#s51
Yeah

#s53
That 's true

#s54
You d-

#s56
Well How would you go about changing it

#s60
Leave the details up to somebody else huh

#s67
Yeah

#s69
Well you know uh talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases

#s70
It 's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh V C R or television repair

#s71
If you take your T V in a lot of these T V repair places will say well I 'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars

#s72
and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that 's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it

#s73
He he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars

#s74
Now if he comes in and says you know I 'll repair your your V C R or somebody else 's V C R for a hundred dollars gets in there maybe it 's a blown fuse

#s75
takes him two minutes

#s76
he fixes it

#s77
he still charges you that hundred dollars

#s78
So maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it 's a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case

#s79
and that 's it

#s81
None of this

#s83
Oh yeah

#s85
Yeah

#s87
That 's true

#s89
Yeah

#s90
Um y- well you you know you 're talking to part of them that 's paying for that

#s93
That 's right

#s94
You know that 's it it 's it 's amazing

#s95
and and when you stop and look at it I mean the judges th- they 're all former lawyers
