Well how do you feel about trial by jury

#s4
In what way

#s7
Oh do do you feel they are swayed more toward

#s8
are you talking about with criminal or civil suits

#s10
So do you think that I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
The other thing the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know that a judge can be

#s17
I I like the idea of juries of your peers uh in that you you you get more personally more than one person making the making a decision

#s19
And second of all you get a wide variety of background so that

#s22
Uh-huh

#s23
I 'd agree with that

#s25
That 's definitely a problem

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Yeah

#s39
yeah

#s40
I guess I I definitely agree with you

#s41
but sin- the

#s42
well what I do n't like about uh sentence the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less

#s44
the the same crime gets unequal sentences

#s46
I uh I think there is more of an ability of you know you know for selecting a jury two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent

#s49
but I think I think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board

#s52
Uh-huh

#s53
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s59
Of course a lot of that 's also the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer

#s61
Uh-huh

#s68
Yeah

#s69
I agree

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
Uh-huh

#s73
Oh yeah

#s74
I I agree with it

#s75
yeah

#s76
They will admit to you that they can- do n't have the benefit of being able to you know of of letting allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty

#s78
it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument

#s80
That the

#s81
Uh-huh

#s84
Uh-huh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s89
Yeah

#s90
Uh this is a little bit of the subject

#s91
but one one thing that I really dislike uh also that 's that 's new is the uh is that I have heard that there are federal sentences
