Uh well where I 'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference

#s4
and course we have Duke University that was the national champions last year

#s5
so I 'm kind of hoping that they 'll repeat again this year

#s6
They have a lot of the same players back

#s8
No

#s9
this is college basketball

#s12
Right

#s13
We have like Carolina and Duke and Georgia Tech and N C State teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty

#s15
So hopefully we 'll have a good year

#s16
I do n't really follow the N B A very closely

#s23
Do you like professional basketball

#s28
Yeah

#s33
Well that 's an up and coming team though

#s38
That 's somebody you can get behind and be patient

#s41
Yeah

#s42
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons

#s46
But I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again

#s48
Yeah

#s49
uh-huh

#s53
That 's true

#s55
That 's true

#s56
it will be interesting

#s58
It will certainly be different

#s65
Yeah

#s66
oh my Atlanta Braves

#s68
Well I really do uh you know

#s69
the basketball season 's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks

#s73
It 's a long season

#s81
Yeah

#s84
It 's a little early

#s85
We definitely will

#s88
Good to talk to you

#s91
Bye-bye
