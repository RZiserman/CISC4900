#s1
Uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job

#s2
and how do you feel about them

#s10
Oh that 's good

#s11
Uh-huh

#s12
What kind of a degree have you got

#s15
Oh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s26
How long have you been with them

#s28
Uh

#s30
That 's good

#s32
Uh-huh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
But for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered

#s48
So that you 've got small small things to gripe about

#s50
Wow

#s52
Well that sounds like you must feel really good about it

#s57
Wow

#s59
Uh-huh

#s61
Uh-huh

#s64
Wow

#s67
Well I uh work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory

#s68
I also have a part time job at a law firm

#s69
and I get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does

#s71
Uh and benefits through the government are uh really

#s72
uh they just uh they 're not the greatest

#s73
Uh I before I I uh uh got my degree

#s75
I 'm uh c- a computer scientist

#s77
and before I got my degree I had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington

#s79
and uh at that time I was in gravy city

#s80
Uh the law firms in this town are not you know for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties

#s82
and uh benefits were just amazing

#s84
and we had everything paid for

#s85
and uh anyway with the government it 's not uh quite that nice a deal

#s86
Uh but it 's you know it 's it 's okay

#s87
What we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our uh uh our costs

#s88
and it 's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing

#s89
and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet

#s90
and uh so I I think I 'm actually involved in a relatively good p- plan at this point

#s91
Uh but uh it could be better

#s92
that 's for sure

#s93
and uh but you know the- there are other things that you get when you work for the government i- uh in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere

#s95
It 's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where I do n't have to uh uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that

#s96
and so I 'm I 'm really kind of happy about that end of of things

#s97
It 's uh

#s101
Uh-huh

#s104
Uh-huh

#s108
Wow

#s109
that 's fabulous

#s112
You see now that 's that 's interesting

#s113
because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area

#s116
He he lives in Andover

#s118
and uh the work that he

#s119
he 's uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the Hewlett Packard machines that do uh uh sonographic imagining

#s122
and uh I 've been over to see his complex over there

#s123
and it 's amazing

#s125
It 's it 's all ecologically designed

#s126
and and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up

#s129
And

#s131
Uh-huh
