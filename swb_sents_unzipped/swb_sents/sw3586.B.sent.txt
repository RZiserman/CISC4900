#s2
That 's okay

#s3
I did n't hear

#s5
Okay

#s9
Okay

#s13
You heard her in the background

#s14
That 's babies

#s16
Takes a lot of time huh

#s17
I like uh most sports

#s18
I like to do that

#s19
I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing

#s21
Oh little bit of embroidery work once in a while

#s23
What do you like to do

#s25
Well I 'm sure you probably are

#s28
You like it

#s29
that 's the main MUMBLEx

#s32
That 's right

#s36
Oh boy that 's hard sewing

#s43
Measure it and get it to

#s44
Well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it

#s45
If you get pleats and all kinds of

#s49
That 's a lot of work

#s54
Oh

#s56
Right

#s57
right

#s61
That feels really good

#s65
To do it

#s66
right

#s70
Keeping fish

#s71
Well they 're probably easier than keeping dogs though are n't they

#s74
Oh no

#s75
How much that bothers you

#s76
and you probably have to clean out the tank too

#s82
Oh no

#s84
Oh you 're kidding

#s86
because they need to have a little bit of the

#s90
I see

#s92
Oh no

#s95
And so you 'd have to start all over to build that up probably

#s100
Right

#s101
right

#s103
Do n't go through the whole nine yards

#s104
and they kind of need a little bit of that

#s107
So you 've had fish for a long time

#s113
What size do you have now

#s114
Oh that 's a good size

#s116
Have you ever had it uh crack or break or leak

#s118
MUMBLEx

#s121
Fifty-five gallons you 'd hope it would never do that

#s125
Do you have all kinds of different fish

#s126
or

#s129
Uh-huh

#s131
Real exotic

#s135
Well they 're probably hardy harder to take care of

#s136
and

#s140
Yes

#s141
I bet it is

#s144
Do you have problems with them uh the fish eating each other

#s148
Right

#s150
Then you have to

#s151
how do you isolate them

#s153
A jar or something

#s154
or

#s157
Okay

#s159
Okay

#s162
Okay

#s165
Oh

#s169
Right

#s171
It 'll go through the slot

#s174
That works all right then

#s175
They do n't uh want the mothers to be with the little fish either

#s177
They will

#s179
Is n't that odd

#s181
You would n't think that

#s183
You 're kidding

#s191
And that just makes you sick almost does n't it

#s194
Things are different in the animal kingdom huh

#s197
Yeah

#s198
That 's kind of the way they do it

#s201
Survival of the fittest or something

#s204
Right

#s205
Go hide from them

#s206
well and then you think well how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that

#s211
but If you 're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies
