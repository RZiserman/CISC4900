Right

#s8
Right

#s9
right

#s10
And then when you read about that they 're spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever

#s11
that kind of ticks you off too

#s13
But uh somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we 're paying it 's not that we mind paying taxes it 's that we 're paying too much for a lousy government

#s15
And I I I tend to agree with that

#s17
I 'm not really into what they 're doing per se

#s19
and I think there 's just too many too many levels of bureaucracy

#s20
I think it can be can be managed by less uh less levels

#s26
Right

#s30
Right

#s33
Right

#s36
Right

#s37
well I think we 're going to see a streamlining in the government

#s38
I just you know I I do n't know what kind of uh I do n't know what what level or what how long it will take for you know our country to start the public in general to start saying Hey this is too much

#s39
We 're not going to pay any more You know

#s40
we 're not going to pay for this

#s41
and you 're out you know

#s42
I think we 're starting to see it a little bit now

#s43
but I think uh I do n't know what what kind of input we 're going to get from the public and how they 're going to go about doing it

#s44
Because I think I think we 're just getting taxed way too much

#s46
I mean right now we 're getting taxed probably probably around thirty-five percent or more

#s47
And that 's that 's you know that 's me not making a whole lot of money

#s51
Right

#s55
Right

#s57
Yeah

#s58
we got a sales tax

#s59
Our sales tax is like eight percent

#s60
and I do n't know what our gas tax is

#s61
I think it 's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon

#s63
So I mean they 're hitting us up

#s64
and they may not raise it you know federally as much one year

#s65
but then they 'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever

#s66
It 's just I mean you can see that your money is just not going that far

#s72
Right

#s74
Right

#s75
well I mean you could tell just by just by how much money you have left over

#s76
and all of a sudden I do n't know it 's just it 's eating me alive
