#s2
Okay

#s4
Yes

#s5
I did

#s7
I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia

#s9
Uh it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students

#s10
I had gone to a small school growing up uh

#s11
and a lot of my friends went to univert- University of Michigan

#s12
but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and uh were looking for a southern school

#s13
and uh also U of M seemed overwhelming in size

#s15
and uh what about you

#s17
Oh so you 're from the Midwest too

#s21
Uh I live in Texas now

#s22
Where are you

#s25
Oh uh my brother 's in Austin

#s26
Uh he lives Lakeway

#s27
He uh had moved uh

#s28
we 're in Plano

#s30
And

#s33
Oh Austin is so pretty

#s34
I really like it

#s38
And your daughter is going to be a sophomore

#s42
Is uh because you live in Austin is she thinking about the University of Texas

#s47
Oh

#s54
Yes

#s59
Uh-huh

#s60
Those and those were several uh that we did consider

#s61
Uh my parents uh certainly did n't push but wanted me to look in the south

#s62
and because I had been in a small school they suggested that I probably I

#s63
when I say small my graduating class had eighteen in it

#s65
And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one uh or small group situations

#s67
And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology

#s68
and I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe

#s70
Uh I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year

#s72
and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing

#s73
and I ended up majoring in French

#s74
One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department

#s75
They also had a strong language department

#s76
and I 'd always loved working with children

#s77
Uh and I found that I could n't fit everything in

#s78
but because I had had a fair amount of French going in I was able to do my year 's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me

#s80
Uh and so that was some of

#s82
but

#s83
several of the things you mentioned were the things that uh our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M

#s84
He but he thinks he wants to be a writer

#s85
and I do n't think that

#s87
Yes

#s88
Uh and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand

#s90
Uh and so he 's used to a bigger size

#s92
and because my brother is there uh he would have family close by

#s93
So there there are advantages

#s94
Uh but I also

#s95
because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan which was so large

#s96
and they really felt uh like they were numbers

#s99
You still

#s100
Yeah

#s107
Well th- that 's certainly

#s108
uh especially today with the cost of college

#s109
I mean that is a a major uh consideration

#s110
and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools

#s111
And even though Baylor uh

#s113
and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there who just love it

#s114
And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are

#s115
and it is a smaller size

#s116
and uh I do feel like there are a lot of options

#s117
It 's it 's

#s118
but I had been hoping

#s119
some schools I know give uh oh

#s120
even this year Jay had an aptitude test uh

#s123
Yes

#s124
he thinks that 's what he 'd like to do

#s125
but he 's really strong in math and science too

#s126
and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind

#s128
Does your daughter know what she 'd like to do

#s130
Yeah

#s142
Yes

#s144
Uh-huh

#s147
Yes

#s150
Well he but he has even

#s151
now that he 's in high school uh

#s152
and of course there 's there is still time

#s153
but he 's beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it

#s154
You know it 's the it 's
