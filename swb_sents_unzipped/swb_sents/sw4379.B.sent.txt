#s2
Uh-huh

#s3
Do you

#s6
We have a very detailed budget Because my husband is a finance major

#s8
And we have you know we have money that we take out each month that we uh you know for food and and for for gas and things like that

#s9
And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for uh other things

#s11
Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year

#s12
and we budget them into what we call our our needs and wants list

#s14
And so uh the things that like a vacation

#s15
We have a vacation fund

#s16
We have a fund for the things we need And then a for the things that we want

#s18
And uh and we 're continually putting into those you know each month how much we 're going to need

#s19
and then we know the month that we 're going to have enough to get that particular item

#s21
So we very rarely buy anything on credit

#s22
Everything we buy is paid for

#s30
Right

#s31
Right

#s38
Right

#s40
Uh we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money Uh instead of just writing checks for things

#s43
If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here

#s45
And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for uh the vacation That we put in for Christmas

#s47
Well a lot of that uh I do n't know how safe it is

#s48
I guess uh we keep it all in a safe here at the house

#s51
And so it 's actually pulled out

#s52
Then we keep our

#s54
we have a savings account for the kids ' education

#s55
That money goes into there

#s57
Each of our

#s58
we have three children

#s59
So they each have their own account

#s61
That money is put into each month

#s65
He does somewhat

#s66
Yeah

#s67
He does somewhat

#s69
Uh we have an investment plan

#s70
Yeah

#s71
I guess he does

#s73
But uh we have really found

#s74
this is the first year we 've done it this way

#s75
And we are really saving a lot of money

#s80
Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical

#s81
we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental

#s83
and uh and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance does n't cover rather than wondering where it 's going to come from

#s85
we have it you know

#s87
And when when we see something on sale uh instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill Everything 's taken care of

#s89
And we 're finding that we even have more money than we thought

#s91
Yeah

#s95
I do

#s96
Uh-huh

#s97
All the money

#s100
All the money is turned over to me

#s104
Yes

#s105
I have a set amount

#s106
It 's very generous

#s107
and I usually have extra

#s109
And so then that can go uh you know either back into our checking account

#s110
or I can just carry it over

#s112
Uh you know there are certain months of the year that you 'll spend more on food than other months And certain times when that will be left over

#s114
But that 's completely up to me how I do that

#s115
And then uh because I do n't work

#s116
I stay home

#s120
And so it 's kind of my money

#s121
and I also get my own money to do what I want to Go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing

#s123
We have a clothing uh envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing

#s125
It really works out great

#s126
We 're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that

#s127
And we 're

#s133
Yes

#s134
We have a household budget

#s135
Like we 're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that 's coming out of her crib this year

#s137
And also we need a new bed

#s138
And so we 've got both of those budgeted

#s139
and we put a certain amount in each month

#s140
and we know which month we 'll enough saved to go buy those

#s142
And if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards
