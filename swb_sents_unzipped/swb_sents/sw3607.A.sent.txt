#s1
So uh what kind of home repair work have you done

#s4
Been pulling them up huh or just loosening them until the rain came in

#s7
Are you in the section of Texas that 's been getting so much rain

#s11
Oh okay

#s14
Yeah

#s15
But you 're probably what about halfway across the state from San Antonio though are n't you

#s17
Yeah

#s18
Yeah

#s19
okay

#s20
But you 're still getting a good bit of the rain though

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Yeah

#s28
Is it asphalt shingles

#s29
or or MUMBLEx

#s33
Ooh

#s34
that should be a lot of fun

#s36
Did you put them up originally or just going up stopping leaks in them

#s44
Yeah

#s48
Uh we 're in uh campus apartment buildings with flat top

#s49
uh

#s51
Not too much

#s52
They 're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs

#s54
Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof

#s55
or is it pretty steep

#s58
What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal

#s60
Yeah

#s61
I imagine

#s62
I imagine

#s64
Yeah

#s65
yeah

#s66
that would be just too much of a fall for me

#s67
Um have you been uh

#s68
was was the house reasonably new

#s69
or you been doing some remodeling work on it

#s71
That 's pretty new house yet

#s76
Yeah

#s79
Yeah

#s82
It 's settling unevenly

#s85
Yeah

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
Uh-huh

#s90
Well that sounds like a lot of fun

#s93
Um

#s94
What is it

#s95
like uh stucco walls or

#s97
Oh drywall

#s99
Wood framing

#s102
Okay

#s107
MUMBLEx they plastered over drywall

#s110
I remember my parents home is drywalled

#s111
and then they uh almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look

#s114
and made for kind of a hard shell on the on the drywall

#s119
Yeah

#s120
that 's good

#s121
Yeah

#s122
Yeah

#s123
that would that would be in terribly terribly exasperating to have the the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that
