Arlington Texas

#s2
now since I got somebody from Arlington Virginia one day

#s4
Yeah

#s8
Oh

#s10
Birmingham

#s12
Right

#s13
It 's funny how many names have been used uh all over the country

#s16
Well to tell you the truth I 've been going to college for the last four years

#s17
so mainly text books

#s19
No

#s20
um

#s21
but I I really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones

#s23
but you know sometimes biogr-

#s24
I just read one about Grace Kelley

#s25
I love to read about real people

#s26
To me half the time it 's more fascinating than some of these made up stories

#s30
Yeah

#s31
it happened

#s33
Really

#s38
Right

#s39
I used to like to read about royalty a lot

#s40
I when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived I think in Europe

#s41
That was my thing for a while

#s45
Oh really

#s49
Oh it sounds like fun

#s51
Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know

#s52
Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those

#s56
Really

#s59
Sounds like something she would write

#s64
Yeah

#s65
I 've heard that she 's done real- you know her books are really interesting

#s66
and they always sell well

#s68
And uh

#s70
Yeah

#s71
brings it to life

#s72
I know uh the Bri- some of the British people laugh at us because we 're so enthralled with their royalty

#s75
I know

#s76
our movie stars

#s79
Oh right

#s83
Um

#s86
Oh yes

#s88
Oh I always like those

#s90
Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch

#s93
Is n't she fabulous

#s95
Oh once you st-

#s96
I do n't like to get one of her books

#s97
because I I just live to read

#s98
I 'll I 'll skip everything just to get back to the book

#s100
Oh yeah

#s101
She 's just a

#s102
I do n't know

#s103
does she how often does she come out with them

#s104
I probably have missed the last few since I 've been back in school

#s108
Well she can she can turn them out overnight I swear

#s112
Yeah

#s113
I 've never read a whole one of hers I do n't think

#s114
And think how rich she is

#s119
Oh yeah

#s122
And then make movies out of some of them

#s127
Well hers are so involved

#s128
and they 're so such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot you know

#s131
I do too

#s132
so she could n't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers

#s134
but oh her books are just incredible

#s135
I do n't think they 've ever made a movie do you

#s139
Yes

#s141
well no uh

#s142
I really just thought about it now

#s143
but there 's just

#s145
Maybe it 's because they take so much in

#s146
I do n't know

#s149
They 're so big

#s151
they 're such you know

#s152
it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND

#s153
I guess another three hour movie

#s157
Oh I know

#s158
It 's about one of my favorite movies

#s160
No

#s161
it had such a bad press

#s162
I was n't too MUMBLEx

#s168
Uh-huh

#s169
Right

#s171
Me either

#s172
Do you know anyone that 's read it

#s174
No

#s175
I have n't heard of anybody that 's read it either

#s177
I think it was on the best-seller list though for a while
