Okay uh

#s2
what kind of hobbies do you have Lori

#s4
Uh-huh

#s6
Uh-huh

#s7
Where do you play golf in this area

#s9
Uh-huh

#s13
Do you uh do you ride

#s14
or do you pull a cart when you play golf

#s16
Oh

#s18
I was going to say that could be difficult

#s23
Uh-huh

#s26
I think that might be true

#s28
I do n't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path

#s33
That is the reason I do n't play over there

#s35
I like the course

#s36
but I do n't play over there because you they do n't uh you know do n't allow you to pull a cart

#s38
And I do n't think a cart damages the turf

#s44
Uh-huh

#s47
Well I guess I could use a card too

#s48
I live uh very near uh very close to the Firewheel Golf Course

#s51
Yes

#s52
I live in northwest Garland

#s53
Right up there near the golf course

#s62
Well in the last two years I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts

#s64
So I have uh I have uh I have children Boy Scout age

#s66
I have two boys that are boy scout age

#s67
and uh so I am very active in Boy Scouts

#s69
so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby

#s71
But I

#s73
but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again

#s74
because my boys are still right at the beginning age

#s75
and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college

#s78
That 's right

#s79
Lessons are expensive though

#s82
Well they would probably never make it then

#s83
because I do n't think uh

#s84
I only took lessons for golf when I was in college

#s86
Uh as a course for P E you know so I could graduate

#s90
But uh that is the only time I think I have ever really taken golf lessons

#s91
and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual

#s95
I took one lesson one other time

#s96
Besides that uh I just uh try to make the club hit the ball

#s100
I do n't want to play strike out you know

#s102
But I have fun doing it

#s103
some uh you know I have some good shots and some bad shots

#s106
So you said you work uh in the gardens too

#s107
Do you have uh a special flowers

#s112
My wife had uh just put in a bunch of I want to say they are pansies

#s114
She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants

#s116
And they have been

#s117
we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine

#s120
That is when she did I think

#s135
Uh-huh

#s136
Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time

#s137
Will they make it through the summer sun

#s142
Well

#s146
Well that is good
