My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers

#s4
You bet

#s6
Well I uh

#s7
when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama

#s9
so I kind of grabbed on to that team way back when

#s15
That 's right

#s16
How about your favorite team

#s23
Uh-huh

#s28
Well they are exciting are n't they

#s31
Boy

#s32
they are they are just a fun team to watch

#s35
Uh no

#s36
I did n't

#s39
Oh yeah

#s42
Oh you 're kidding

#s44
Oh my gos-

#s48
Oh I ca n't believe that

#s51
That 's hilarious

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Oh

#s58
Oh boy

#s59
He is tough

#s60
he has an incredible leg

#s63
Well do you think they 're they 're going to be able to make it this year past the first playoff game

#s67
Who 's that

#s69
Right

#s73
What do you think about uh Houston

#s76
Oh yeah

#s80
Huh

#s82
Huh

#s85
Oh yeah

#s86
he 's he definitely uh is one of the best I think

#s91
Right

#s93
Well they squeaked out a game on Sunday

#s96
They played Dallas

#s99
They won in overtime

#s103
So that was

#s104
I I watched that game

#s105
and uh that was uh

#s107
Well because I 'm right here in Dallas I I kind of pull for Dallas

#s109
Yeah

#s110
Well also Houston is uh in Pittsburgh 's division

#s111
so I 'll almost always root against them

#s116
That 's okay

#s117
Well I you know I I was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here

#s119
and they just kind of grew on me

#s125
Yeah

#s126
Yeah

#s128
Well

#s130
To tell you the truth I have n't paid too much attention to that

#s132
Um what cities are they looking at

#s134
Uh-huh

#s136
Uh-huh

#s142
You know I think you are right

#s143
I think it is Raleigh

#s145
I think I remember hearing that

#s149
That would be fun

#s150
I 'd like to see some more teams get in

#s154
Uh-huh

#s157
Oh really
