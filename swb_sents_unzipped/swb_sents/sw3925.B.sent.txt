Okay

#s7
You 're asking what my opinion about whether it 's possible to have honesty in government

#s9
Well I suspect that it is possible

#s10
Uh I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody

#s13
But uh other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
So they 're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers

#s31
Right

#s32
Yeah

#s33
But I think maybe a lot of them um

#s34
say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while I 'm in office

#s37
And you know how good a name can I make for myself and so forth

#s38
So I guess it would be like anything else

#s40
The president of General Motors probably has the same

#s50
I think I- I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be more to the point

#s54
If you knew what you were getting when you voted uh

#s56
Yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s64
they say you get the government you deserve

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
It 's hard to imagine

#s74
Yeah

#s75
and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of the scandal you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find on say in the Bobsy twins or something like that

#s79
So you 're taking a government course

#s81
At what

#s82
The university

#s85
Oh

#s87
Okay

#s92
You can make laws against corruption

#s95
But that does n't eliminate it does it

#s99
Well they 've got laws against cannib- cannibalism

#s100
but that did n't stop that guy in Milwaukee did it

#s108
Actually I think other countries may have it worse uh

#s109
the Japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal

#s111
Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him

#s113
So uh

#s118
Yeah

#s119
I 've been around to a few other countries

#s120
and I uh I I have not found one yet that I would rather live in

#s121
I think uh
