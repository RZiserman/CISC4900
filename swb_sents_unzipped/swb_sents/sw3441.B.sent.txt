My T V down

#s2
Okay

#s3
I 'm sorry

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
Yes

#s11
I hate those canned messages they put on my recorder

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s20
I have through the phone company uh

#s22
no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received

#s26
Uh-huh

#s28
Uh-huh

#s30
Right

#s31
Yes

#s32
and I do n't have children around

#s33
but I just do n't like those nine hundred numbers

#s34
So I 've excluded those

#s36
But is n't it does not stop you from the uh dialing services

#s38
Where they uh intend to sell you things

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s42
And leave again that canned message on the

#s45
Uh-huh

#s46
Uh-huh

#s49
Right

#s52
Well that 's the thing I hated too about uh Radio Shack

#s54
If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number

#s55
And I do n't think they 're going to call me and ask me how it 's functioning

#s56
and and I do n't give that out

#s57
I have an unlisted number

#s58
so I do n't

#s62
Sure

#s64
Uh-huh

#s67
Well anything that you buy um you ca- you may get put on the a uh preferred list that is purchased

#s70
And and companies can purchase this list

#s71
and what that is is people who buy from the mail

#s74
Uh-huh

#s77
Uh no

#s78
Not really

#s79
Um no

#s80
Uh of that unfortunately is legal

#s81
So they ca n't stop people from uh advertising

#s82
and that and that 's what it falls under

#s83
It falls under the guise of advertising

#s84
So I do n't care for it

#s85
but is it a legal uh solution for some companies

#s86
So that that 's the way things are

#s90
Uh-huh

#s91
Uh-huh

#s93
Well they you know

#s94
that 's that 's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy

#s95
You 've got the holy rollers

#s96
and you 've got uh all kinds of people knocking on your door and who want to uh either direct you to the right path or or want to uh sell you uh paper routes uh whatever

#s97
so um you know it 's not just the telephone
