They tell you what our topic was

#s3
Right

#s4
How much of a golfer are you

#s6
You bet

#s7
I 'm fifty years old

#s8
I 've been a hacker

#s9
I think I think I played better golf when I was fifteen John than I play right now

#s12
And uh

#s15
Oh I know

#s16
it 's just unreal

#s17
I you know I 'm a guy that plays

#s18
if I play a lot of golf I play six to eight times a year

#s19
and that 's about it

#s20
I figure that 's my retirement game

#s21
I really

#s22
I come from a family of golfers

#s24
I mean I was raised by a man my stepfather who with a two handicap I mean he he he he could get down on his knees and hit the ball I mean further than most people could hit it

#s26
And my mother who is now he 's my stepfather is dead but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap

#s27
but but uh all they did every day in their life was to play golf every

#s28
they 'd leave work and go to a golf course or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond Virginia and just uh play nine holes of golf

#s30
That was their deal

#s31
they

#s34
But uh I just I just never could do it

#s35
I have a brother-in-law who is uh an ex-college coach and like a pro

#s36
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf

#s37
sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family

#s43
Oh really

#s46
Yeah

#s48
Yeah

#s50
I think I 'm probably the same way

#s51
Lessons do help

#s52
I know ever year we buy

#s53
I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner

#s54
it 's a hunter 's type affair

#s56
and I buy in in Austin Texas

#s57
I go down to Austin

#s58
I live in the Dallas area

#s59
but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine

#s61
and we always buy this weekend at a at a country club in the hill country You know at uh Horseshoe Bay

#s65
And we just have a ball

#s66
and we play three days in a row three different courses

#s67
and course believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the uh third course my score has gone from you know a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five

#s68
So

#s71
You bet

#s72
so it that makes a lot of difference to me

#s81
You bet

#s84
Yeah

#s86
That 's super

#s87
I have n't learned to hit the ball easy

#s88
and I just sort of

#s89
I 'm always wanting to hit it hard

#s90
and that 's something my stepfather never could teach me you know just to relax and hit the ball

#s91
and you know so subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve fourteen holes my you know a lot of my energy 's gone

#s92
when I do swing it 's an easier swing

#s94
and I do actually hit the ball better

#s97
No

#s98
I have a two through you know two through wedge

#s99
I hit a two iron awful lot

#s100
Off now off the tee I do n't hit a driver off the tee

#s102
That that 's why I need my driving lessons

#s105
That helps

#s109
Well that 's that 's a good idea

#s110
I think this next year I 'm going to I 'm going to attempt to play more

#s111
and I 'm going to do the same thing

#s112
I I laid off my woods about three years ago

#s113
and I just use a two wood off the fairway

#s114
and I 'm a fairly strong person

#s115
so I get a pretty good little drive

#s117
and I and I guess control my irons better you know

#s118
if you 'll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron

#s121
And uh I still remember that watching myself and my son

#s122
so but I think the key is you just need to you need to play more often than I play

#s126
Right

#s128
Makes good makes good sense

#s135
Oh yeah

#s141
You bet

#s142
My cha- my challenge of the game is just

#s143
if I can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around watching you I 'd be great after that

#s144
That boy

#s145
I just

#s146
if I get off the tee box and I and I 've you know you know anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight I just want to get down and kiss the ground you know

#s148
right

#s149
Because
