So let 's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order

#s2
and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it

#s3
What do you think

#s4
Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there

#s10
What what if you 're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though

#s11
I mean what if you do n't even realize that you 're subject to paying uh income tax on something that you purchase mail order

#s18
Well I mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when I purchase something mail order it 's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania

#s19
It 's because I 'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

#s21
Uh it 's because I I ca n't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area

#s22
So I go outside the area for that

#s23
And I think that it 's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state

#s24
I do n't I do n't think that that 's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer

#s31
Well I think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then I do n't argue with it

#s32
Because it 's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh I bought this out of state

#s33
I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania

#s35
Right

#s36
But the point is is that businesses do that

#s37
The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question

#s38
That 's a cost of doing business

#s39
The burden should n't be placed on the consumer

#s41
Uh

#s46
Uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax Or purchasing

#s54
Yeah

#s55
See I 'm unfamiliar with that because I do n't I never see that end of the business

#s57
So my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer

#s58
Uh but if that 's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that uh the opportunity f- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided
