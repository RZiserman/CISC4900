#s20
Um where about is that

#s22
Oh okay

#s23
I I 've been to Cafe Pacific

#s26
Right

#s29
Yes

#s30
Uh

#s32
Before we moved to the area my brother uh lived in Dallas for a number of years

#s33
and we came up one time when my father was visiting

#s34
and we all ate there

#s36
and oh their seafood was wonderful

#s39
Now where is the Atlantic Cafe

#s41
Oh okay

#s51
No um

#s52
but I 've heard that 's really good too

#s53
and

#s57
Oh

#s61
Oh

#s62
Oh okay

#s64
Uh-huh

#s71
You know right away what you want

#s75
Well we really enjoy prime rib too

#s76
and uh actually the the Steak And Ale out here uh we 've gone to uh

#s77
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they 've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night

#s80
and uh the time we went the prime rib was really good

#s84
Uh-huh

#s88
Yeah

#s89
yeah

#s93
Oh I 've heard about that too

#s96
but no

#s97
We 've uh I guess we eat out even less than I realize

#s101
Oh

#s104
Yeah

#s105
Yes

#s106
I 'd I had heard that too Um

#s109
Have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway

#s110
Oh okay

#s117
Yes uh

#s119
primarily lunch

#s120
well and breakfast sometimes

#s121
but uh during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that included the soup an- or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert

#s124
and uh the

#s125
my husband and I like veal uh a lot

#s127
and their veal dishes have been good

#s128
We 've tried different ones when they 've had them as one of the

#s130
Uh-huh

#s132


#
I

#s136
yes

#s137
no

#s142
Right

#s143
And

#s145
I have n't either uh

#s146
one place

#s147
and I 've only been there for lunch

#s148
but uh I went with a friend

#s149
and we met her husband um down on Greenville

#s150
down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin 's

#s152
Oh I we just we-

#s154
It was

#s155
and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup

#s156
and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup

#s157
and they did

#s158
It was wonderful

#s159
but uh and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert which was a chocolate sack

#s160
I do n't know if you tried

#s161
but or s-

#s167
Yes

#s169
It yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream

#s171
and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry uh puree

#s173
and and we shared one the three of us

#s175
and it was plenty because it was very rich

#s176
but uh I wished I 'd had a camera

#s178
It was beautiful

#s181
Uh

#s184
Oh

#s188
Oh

#s191
Yes

#s192
Yeah

#s193
Oh

#s195
It sounds wonderful

#s199
Well that 's uh one of the things th- that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant

#s200
Uh I love fresh berries

#s201
And their their fruits are always exceptional

#s202
I do n't I 'm know

#s203
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer 's Market uh you ca n't find them like that

#s206
and

#s221
Uh-huh

#s223
I would too

#s224
because well because we do n't go out very often

#s225
When we do go out um in a way it 's like a little mini vacation I guess

#s226
and uh it is it 's a whole experience

#s227
Of course you want the food to be good

#s228
but the atmosphere and service I think are important uh too

#s231
Yeah

#s233
Um that reminded me of a place for lunch that 's a little off the beaten track

#s234
but it is wonderful

#s235
It 's called Cafe Max

#s236
and it 's at Plano Road and Campbell

#s237
They have the most wonderful salads

#s238
They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three
