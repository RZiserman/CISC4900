#s2
So what So what gets you

#s6
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s14
Well I mean I

#s15
that 's exactly the kind of thing I would have said

#s16
Although in my case it 's my wife and I both work

#s17
we come home

#s18
and just as we 're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings

#s19
and it 's one solicitation call after another

#s20
and you know

#s22
Yeah

#s23
it 's it 's like you say very annoying

#s25
and uh why why do we let this happen

#s35
Would would you

#s36
mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate

#s43
Yeah

#s44
It it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we do n't want to receive calls like that

#s46
And the people making these calls would be obliged to c- compare the their lists that they 're going to call against this list of people who do n't want to be called

#s51
Uh

#s53
And that that way those who want it can have it

#s54
and those who do n't want it do n't have to have it

#s56
Sort of like an unlisted number where you have n't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself

#s59
Except even unlisted numbers are n't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers Uh automatically

#s62
and

#s64
Right

#s67
Yeah

#s69
Uh-huh

#s73
Yeah

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
Yes

#s78
And these and these people may in fact be just looking to s- find an unoccupied house to rob

#s82
Uh-huh

#s84
Yeah

#s86
What about these telephone callers Sometimes they 're door-to-door but usually they 're telephone callers who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire

#s90
Well I think these people were hired by from from different sources

#s92
Uh with you know

#s93
and so therefore there 's no one answer

#s94
But but yeah

#s95
sometimes it 's a market sur- basically it 's a market survey

#s97
but they never say who who they 're really working for or what you know what what what questions are you know

#s101
Yeah

#s102
Yeah

#s104
Yeah

#s106
Yeah

#s109
Right

#s110
well and sometimes that 's this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too

#s113
Other times it 's you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose

#s115
For which if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider

#s118
But but a dollar is n't it you know

#s119
it 's

#s121
Uh and I also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people giveaway personal information

#s122
Uh when when the call comes and and they uh you know sort of seductive to you know

#s123
somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things

#s124
and so I start answering

#s125
and then you you know you go down a path

#s127
uh and you do n't know where it 's going to end

#s129
Uh In fact you do n't even know what you 've eventually you know the totality of what you 've revealed

#s131
and you know This is n't you know prob- most likely not to going to be used against you

#s133
but it could

#s134
and And that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed Because it 's subject to abuse

#s140
and it
