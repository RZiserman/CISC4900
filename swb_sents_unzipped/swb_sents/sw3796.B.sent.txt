#s2
You know what

#s3
I watched a little bit of uh of the Bulls game

#s4
and I uh had to leave

#s5
Uh in fact I I think the Bulls were ahead when I uh when I left

#s6
Who won the game

#s9
Is that right

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Wow they 've got the do n't they have the best record now

#s19
Yeah

#s21
Wow

#s25
They they do

#s26
and they you know

#s27
I think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh of uh uh

#s28
Michael Jordan really helped them out

#s29
You know he does n't have they do n't have to rely on him to score ev- you know thirty or forty points at every at every game

#s31
so

#s35
Oh I know

#s36
I 'm

#s37
yeah

#s38
I saw the w- I saw the Warriors uh just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors uh Dallas game

#s41
They look good

#s44
Yeah

#s45
now I do n't uh I have n't kept up with what was going on with uh with the

#s51
Uh-huh

#s54
Good move

#s63
Yeah

#s66
Uh I think Boston 's in first

#s67
Uh I you know I have n't kept up with any of the other uh teams

#s68
I 'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know

#s71
Oh man

#s72
That

#s73
well yeah

#s74
but I mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them

#s75
and uh you know they 're going I I think they 're going for an all time record of how many l- you know losses in a row they can they c- they can uh pull out

#s77
It 's unbelievable

#s80
Uh

#s81
actually actually the the the Dallas area here uh pulls for Dallas

#s82
Uh San Antonio pulls for San Antonio

#s83
and Houston pulls for for the Rockets

#s86
There really

#s87
I mean not a whole lot You know

#s88
I mean you find them they 're find them be to be pretty loyal uh in with the local teams

#s90
Uh you know it 's kind of I guess it 's kind of like uh there in the Bay area you know you do n't find a whole lot of uh of Sacramento fans

#s94
Really is n't

#s95
uh-uh

#s97
It 's you know it 's it 's about the same uh same distance from here to s- to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento

#s101
So it 's yeah it 's not really a local you know

#s104
Uh he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio

#s105
and they I mean they have got a great club You know

#s108
Yeah

#s109
Yeah

#s110
that always makes a big difference

#s113
So

#s116
Yeah

#s118
And you know uh you know I used to think that that one one player really does n't make a club

#s119
but it really does you know

#s121
You get somebody like Magic

#s122
and you can see the decline in that team

#s124
Once he left you know it 's it 's just not the same uh it 's not the same team

#s125
There 's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for

#s131
Oh yeah

#s135
Who won that Portland game

#s139
Uh
