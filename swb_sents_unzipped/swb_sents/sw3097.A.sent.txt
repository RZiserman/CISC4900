Hi Pat

#s4

#s14

#s15

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s27
Yeah

#s28
it 's

#s29
well even even raising boys today is different though because they are expected to do so much more than they used to

#s32
You know used to be they would just go off to work and come home

#s33
and you know everything was done

#s34
And it it 's a different world

#s35
It 's some good some bad uh

#s38
it 's nice that there 's a choice

#s39
I I have chosen to stay at home and raise my children

#s42
And I have a ten year old and a twelve year old

#s44
And I was a single parent for awhile and worked

#s46
And that was great

#s47
I was able to and I was able to provide for my children

#s48
and and you know that was wonderful

#s51
But I I thank God everyday now that I have that choice And that I am able to do things at home

#s53
and and uh I volunteer a whole lot

#s55
And uh that 's my job right now

#s57
And I I love it

#s59
I really love it

#s61
Right

#s62
right

#s64
Right

#s65
and that will come

#s67
I know that day will come

#s69
and I am looking forward to that too

#s71
But that 's a different phase in my life

#s73
and I am I am glad that I am able to do what I want to do right now

#s78
Uh-huh

#s79

#s105
Yeah

#s106

I was rea- I was really looking forward to summer thinking oh we are going to have some time off

#s153
And it 's been real busy

#s154
And actually today is really the first as far as I am concerned the first day of summer Because we have had so much going on the past few weeks

#s157
And uh you are right

#s159
uh well that 's how society has changed uh you know uh

#s162
the family has changed

#s163
we you know we find ourselves doing things that we never did as kids

#s165
You know I do not remember being involved in things like this

#s168
It 's it 's different

#s170
it 's just

#s171
I do not know

#s172
only time will tell whether it 's better or worse than the way we grew up

#s174
But uh it 's it 's just very different

#s177
Um

#s181
Yeah

#s182

#s183

#s195

#s198
Uh-huh

#s200
