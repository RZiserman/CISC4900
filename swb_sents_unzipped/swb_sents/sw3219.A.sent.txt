Okay

#s2
why do n't you start

#s3
so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon

#s5
Oh you are

#s7
Oh wonderful

#s8
well how do you dress for work

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s15
So you 're in a church there

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
Well I 'm working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool

#s19
and they 've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds

#s20
and they have a lot of uh they have BIBLE lessons

#s21
and they have all the things during the morning

#s22
but they still have snack time and play time

#s23
so I 'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and T-shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just just tennis shoes and play clothes

#s26
Yeah

#s27
I 'm envious

#s28
Well it 's a beautiful day here

#s29
and it 's in the sixties

#s30
but we still have a lot of hot afternoons

#s31
it 's supposed to be eighty-five today

#s32
so you 'll still see people

#s33
it 's kind of an in between change that they 're in their play clothes I mean they 're in their summer clothes during the afternoons because you just ca n't stand the sweaters

#s34
but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly

#s37
Did you

#s39
I understand

#s41
Well so are the people around you um dressing similar to you

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
so you do n't have to you do n't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do

#s47
Well that 's good

#s48
That 's good

#s51
Uh-huh

#s53
Well that 's wonderful

#s55
Well my husband has to take the bus into Dallas and does n't return all day

#s56
so he has to dress

#s57
and he just really hates it

#s58
they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit

#s59
and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said it 's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress

#s62
Uh-huh

#s64
Uh-huh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Well I think that 's I think that 's great

#s70
I think that 's good

#s72
I understand

#s74
Well another interesting thing on the our our end here is how even in my forties how much younger I dress than my mother would have in her forties

#s75
and I will run around to the store in things in slacks and tennis shoes

#s76
and she

#s78
Right

#s79
and pearls

#s80
and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school

#s81
so uh she tells me I dress young

#s82
but that 's okay MUMBLEx

#s85
Well there 's not a lot more I can think of to discuss on clothing

#s88
MUMBLEx I guess this is what you call a natural end

#s91
Well we wear

#s92
of course like I said if my husband 's going downtown he 's got the whole uh you know the dress men 's dress shoes

#s94
but for as out here just anything that the moms

#s95
we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids

#s97
Yeah

#s98
I 'm sure they are there

#s99
Yeah

#s100
I 'm sure they are

#s101
That 's right

#s102
I 'm sure that true

#s103
It 's a lot different than working in a kids preschool

#s105
That 's right

#s106
Well you all have a nice day there

#s109
Thank you very much

#s111
Bye-bye
