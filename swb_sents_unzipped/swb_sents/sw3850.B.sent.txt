They 're uh they 're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though

#s42
Which ones are you watching

#s43
the new ones

#s47
Oh okay

#s48
Yeah

#s51
Well they 're they 're a lot different

#s52
But I like I like the older ones because at that time you know they were really futuristic you know

#s54
And the newer ones are I guess the newer ones are real futuristic too

#s55
but I like I like both of them

#s60
Really

#s64
No

#s65
Not really

#s66
It 's not really like a soap opera

#s69
but but it 's

#s70
but that 's true

#s71
I mean you you learn more about the characters and stuff

#s72
but that 's the way all shows are now

#s77
Yeah

#s80

Yeah

#s95
I saw that one

#s97

#s101
I wondered if that 's

#s103
see I do n't know if that 's a the movie of the week or or what

#s104
but it seems like there 's only about four or five different ones

#s105
and then then they keep showing them over and over

#s107
He was a movie director

#s108

#s118
Uh-huh

#s136
that was a different soap opera

#s138
