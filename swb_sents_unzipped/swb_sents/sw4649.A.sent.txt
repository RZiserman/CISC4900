#s1
Uh I 've had uh three boys through I guess uh some child care each one of them

#s2
and now they 're in school

#s3
so it 's all over

#s4
but uh I guess I would say it 's not easy to find wha- what most parents would want

#s6
Is that right

#s7
I guess uh the only rule uh I can think of is that I like to look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that

#s8
If they 're associated with a college or a university they 're usually a pretty good bet

#s10
Uh I think it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something

#s11
You 'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care

#s14
Yeah

#s15
For profit places I would really look at them awfully carefully

#s17
but uh when I was when my kids were young I was teaching at a university

#s18
and uh the child care center associated with our university was quite good

#s19
so I felt confident that they 'd do right

#s23
Oh you mean uh learning type

#s24
uh yeah

#s25
I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission

#s27
But yeah

#s28
I suppose uh if you 're if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find you might find that they 're pushing one form of education or another

#s29
I guess that 's true

#s30
But uh I never had bad experience in that respect

#s31
Of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents

#s32
and they you know pretty good people

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s38
I never really worry very much about it

#s39
I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public

#s40
so I never really worried too much about that being uh uh the case with my boys

#s43
Uh I you know I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them

#s44
but

#s46
I do n't think it 's as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe

#s49
Oh yeah

#s50
I mean that

#s53
Right

#s55
Well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were uh in school

#s56
And I 'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult

#s57
And I think it was the right thing to do

#s59
and we were uh we just decided that we would do it

#s60
and we went ahead

#s61
but uh not everybody can make that choice

#s62
and even even though my wife was n't working we did have uh one or another of the boys in uh child care for part-ti- just for part of the day Uh or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on

#s63
so So we did look around

#s65
I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not

#s66
and uh so I would always trust her judgment on that

#s72
Uh-huh

#s78
There 's absolutely no question that you 're going to be the best child care provider for that kid

#s79
so yeah

#s80
do it as long you can

#s82
But I think you know you have to look through a place

#s83
and you have to get a feel for uh how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them

#s86
And I think you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they 're perfectly open That you 're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth

#s87
and if they 're at all queasy about that then I 'd look elsewhere

#s88
yeah

#s91
Right

#s93
You have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care

#s96
Uh-huh

#s97
So But I really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems

#s99
I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and uh pay and exhaustion and you know things like that rather than these uh uh really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy

#s101
Yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
Well
