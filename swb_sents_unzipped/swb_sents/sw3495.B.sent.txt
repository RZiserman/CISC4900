Okay

#s2
what do you feel are some of the main problems

#s5
Uh-huh

#s10
Yeah

#s12
It it it 's pretty bad here too

#s14
We 've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff In Durham which is right next to Raleigh

#s18
Yeah

#s19
that that

#s20
Durham Raleigh and Chapel Hill is the triangle

#s23
Right

#s27
Yeah

#s28
it 's it 's really it 's

#s29
and I 've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh or or or Chapel Hill

#s31
Chapel Hill is kind of a a ritzy city or whatever

#s32
I mean it 's kind of

#s33
I 'm I 'm sure there is problems with it

#s34
but it has a pretty low crime rate Compare compared to to

#s35
Durham has probably got the worst

#s36
They 've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year

#s38
And over half of it has been drug related

#s44
Yeah

#s49
Yeah

#s51
Well that

#s52
and the and the economy is so bad

#s53
and And so many people have been laid off and stuff

#s55
They 've done special stories on the news local news here

#s57
We had a lot of bank robberies and different lot of break ins and stuff

#s58
I know like a week or so ago

#s59
I live in a in a town house which is you know

#s60
it 's a pretty nice neighborhood

#s61
and this lady was going to work

#s62
she came home

#s63
and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything

#s64
And nobody thought any different

#s65
they just thought she was moving

#s66
It was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned

#s68
Well yeah

#s69
it 's it 's it 's pretty bad

#s71
Uh I would say so for the majority in in our in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home

#s73
and we all know one another

#s74
and and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we 're not moving and different things like that

#s76
It 's

#s77
I I 'm I 'm probably the one of the youngest people that live over here

#s79
Most people are are retired

#s80
or or or you know they 're they 're in their forties or or whatever

#s81
So and I 'm in my twenties

#s82
so I I 'm I 'm out more than they are

#s83
but they 're at home at night

#s85
so I really do n't worry about anything

#s87
Yeah

#s95
Yeah

#s96
see that 's the same thing here

#s103
Yeah

#s109
Yeah
