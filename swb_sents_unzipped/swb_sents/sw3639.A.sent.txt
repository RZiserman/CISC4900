Uh are you presently looking uh for a used car

#s3
Just bought one

#s5
S-

#s6
what did you get

#s8
Lexus

#s9
Uh

#s10
Okay

#s11
Lexus is a Toyota subbrand

#s13
Okay

#s15
I was wondering where that came from

#s16
because they 're talking like it was an American built car

#s20
Yeah

#s22
Yeah

#s25
Yeah

#s28
Yeah

#s34
That 's their big selling point uh other than general luxury

#s35
and but the particular seems to be the uh the quiet ride

#s38
Yeah

#s42
Uh was

#s43
that was n't a standard feature was it

#s45
Okay

#s47
Uh

#s50
Yeah

#s51
you get the impression that

#s53
Uh-huh

#s54
Skidding control

#s55
you mean the antilock brake system

#s58
Yeah

#s62
Oh

#s63
this is a uh Uh probably suspension tied into the brakes

#s67
Um

#s68
Yeah

#s69
Yeah

#s70
uh shoot

#s72
some of these muddy driveways could use it around here

#s73
No

#s74
snow does n't happen very often

#s76
Yeah

#s77
uh originally I 'm from West Virginia

#s78
We got a pretty fair amount of snow

#s82
But uh I got down here in June of eighty-four

#s83
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they 'd seen in twenty years

#s84
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children

#s86
We had this group of uh surveyors come into uh a shop I was working in uh four or five of them

#s87
these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place

#s88
They had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked

#s89
But while they were there they set back drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place had themselves a ball for about an hour

#s93
Yeah

#s97
Yeah

#s99
Oh

#s100
so that 's kind of

#s102
It 's a package deal

#s106
Yeah

#s109
Ouch

#s112
No

#s113
it does n't sound real necessary in Texas

#s114
Yeah

#s115
Yeah

#s116
I worked for Lincoln

#s120
Yeah

#s121
Sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer I used to work for

#s122
They did n't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got

#s123
Little Mercury Tracer

#s127
imagine or not

#s128
they make a they make a luxury Mercury Tracer

#s132
Yeah

#s135
