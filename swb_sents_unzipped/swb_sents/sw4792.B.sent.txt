Hi

#s3
this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota

#s4
How you doing

#s6
Good

#s7
Uh I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it

#s9
Uh I 'm ready whenever you are

#s11
So uh what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there

#s13
Yeah

#s14
Yeah

#s15
I think that 's probably a good thing

#s17
Yeah

#s18
I mean it 's to easy to get a quorum

#s20
and simple majority wo n't do

#s23
Yeah

#s24
that 's

#s25
yeah

#s26
quorums are to easy to get

#s28
And there 's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil 's advocate for a good reason you know

#s29
So it 's it 's

#s31
definitely

#s32
but uh I do n't know

#s33
I could I could n't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing

#s36
Yeah

#s37
Tha-

#s38
I I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that Or arguing against that pretty vehemently

#s39
But uh

#s42
Yeah

#s43
About the only good thing I would say about that is it w- that it would uh hurry the process up a bit

#s45
but I mean even now we 've got I know we 've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that

#s46
and that 's what the trial by jury

#s48
I mean jeez

#s49
if if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances who 's to say

#s53
Yeah

#s54
no doubt

#s55
Are you involved in the legal system at all

#s58
Okay

#s59
Yeah

#s60
yeah

#s61
I 've got some friends that are lawyers

#s62
so

#s66
One of them just got his law degree

#s67
But uh to tell you the truth I 'm not real familiar with uh the system of juris- jurisprudence the way it is right now

#s69
I really have n't studied it in depth

#s72
Yeah

#s74
I 'm sure of it

#s75
Because a lot of those things it 's all it 's in it 's largely a matter of viewpoint And who can argue their case better

#s77
Uh it 's kind of weird

#s78
I do n't know

#s79
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE 'S COURT or something And how weird those cases get

#s81
It 's just

#s83
Yeah

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
And it 's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is

#s89
it 's pretty amazing

#s92
Yeah

#s93
it 's not

#s94
And then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because

#s96
Like this this friend of mine 's pretty obnoxious

#s97
and he really gets into suing people

#s98
And so he 'll he 'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case you know

#s99
it 's like It is It 's it 's wasting people 's time and the taxpayers ' money and everything else

#s102
But uh

#s106
Yeah

#s108
And and most of the time they 're looking to place blame Uh and stuff

#s110
See you 're from California

#s111
is that right

#s115
Oh okay

#s116
I was just thinking

#s117
I wonder I wonder how how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis

#s118
MUMBLEx

#s120
From what I understand it 's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana

#s121
And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the what is it it 's based on common law

#s122
and the rest of the country is not or something like that

#s125
Pretty strange

#s126
But uh fortunately I never have had to go in even even for jury duty

#s129
But uh that friend of mine 's telling me that I might have to go in for uh as a witness

#s130
He may subpoena me

#s131
So we 'll see what happens

#s132
But uh

#s136
Yeah

#s137
It 's

#s138
there are too many big problems you know

#s139
There 's there 's such a backlog of court cases right now

#s140
You know to try to get them all in in a good time

#s142
and we already have too many lawyers as it is

#s145
Yeah

#s146
Yeah

#s147
that 's true

#s148
And in fact they 're even letting some go

#s150
I I I 'm originally from Florida

#s151
and it 's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they do n't have room for them you know

#s153
That 's not a that 's not a good solution either

#s155
I 'm not real sure what the
