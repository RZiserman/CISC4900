Why do n't you go ahead and start

#s8
So you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit not to convict people on circumstantial evidence

#s10
You know I I attended a trial in uh Germany when I was a student

#s11
and uh that 's the sort of system they have

#s13
The trials are held by a panel of three uh three or four judges who are

#s14
well they 're like lawyers I guess

#s15
They 're experts in the law

#s17
and uh there there really is n't a jury

#s18
and uh uh they do the questioning also

#s19
The judges do the questioning

#s20
and uh they

#s22
uh i-

#s23
I think it 's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh uh the judge is also sort of a jury

#s24
uh but I 'm not sure I like that

#s25
I think I prefer the jury system myself

#s28
Uh well actually I think in most criminal cases it would n't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury

#s29
What what I worry about is cases where it 's the government against the individual

#s30
That 's where you really need a jury of peers

#s31
Because uh anytime th- the government uh is the government against the individual you need som- y- you need the protection of ordinary citizens

#s33
I think that 's really the only thing

#s34
I guess where I would like to see the system change is

#s35
uh uh there ought to be a a

#s36
well I guess I do n't think that uh uh juries need to decide sentencing all the time

#s38
I think maybe th- a judge is a better judge of that

#s39
or uh

#s48
Yeah

#s49
Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone 's guilty or innocent

#s50
That 's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe

#s52
But people who d- do n't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe uh a little bit naive

#s54
In Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people

#s56
Uh it 's kind of uh uh a hanging jury atmosphere

#s58
But in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way

#s59
but I guess I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he 's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it

#s60
Some some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that

#s62
I kind of like that system

#s63
Yeah

#s67
Yeah

#s69
Yeah

#s70
Right

#s71
And lawyers blow sand in their eyes

#s74
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries

#s77
Insurance cases and things like that

#s79
Where

#s80
and uh there would be more honest settlements instead of this uh tugging of people 's heart strings and uh making them cry and feel like they 're doing somebody good by giving them or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering

#s86
So In I think i- in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government

#s87
but
