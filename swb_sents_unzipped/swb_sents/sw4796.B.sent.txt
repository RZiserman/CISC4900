#s3
Oh yeah

#s4
Ever since I was a young and uh used to watch the old uh Apollo missions going off in uh classroom T V -s

#s6
Uh I suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off

#s8
Uh very exciting

#s10
The uh uh

#s11
I 've al- I 've always uh w- wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that And uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen

#s13
Of course I 've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday

#s15
But uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately

#s17
Uh computer programmer

#s19
Unfortunately that can be done from the ground

#s22
Yeah

#s23
Made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space

#s24
The uh uh

#s25
I used to think when I was when I was younger that uh by this time we 'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now

#s28
Uh frustrating at times

#s30
I do n't know what you think about all that

#s35
Uh-huh

#s39
Yeah

#s41
Well Yeah

#s42
Well the uh uh

#s43
I 've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up

#s45
Uh because that 's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that does n't do it that does n't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact

#s47
And you can just get as much power as you need up there

#s49
It 's just a matter of how big you build it

#s51
Uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing

#s52
So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good you know very very good for al- for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things I 'd like to see happen would happen also

#s58
Yeah

#s62
Right

#s66
The only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there

#s69
And they want to do the research

#s70
and uh they 're all you know nor-

#s71
Yeah

#s72
the only commitments that they 're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to Mars Which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth

#s74
exactly

#s75
but the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and you know so forth

#s76
Uh-huh

#s77
It it would de- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of instead of for you know

#s78
Uh-huh

#s79
we should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because it 's glitzy to do so

#s81
We should do it because for for the return we get for it

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
And uh unfortunately that 's not what I thinks happened

#s85
Least not

#s86
I I would settle for the gli- for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the uh

#s87
but uh

#s89
the downside of that is you after you do one of those people say well we did it

#s92
Now we 're done

#s93
No need to use this anymo- to play around with this space stuff anymore

#s94
That 's what happened with Apollo

#s95
Uh But uh I 'd give almost anything to get into space
