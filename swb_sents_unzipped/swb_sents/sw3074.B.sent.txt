With the plastic

#s9
Well I just I thought it was sad that they it started out as a good program But then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there

#s12
and I and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just did n't want to set at the curb or take to the dump

#s15
and and uh I it 's too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing

#s22
But uh

#s30
Um

#s33
Oh

#s42
Doing it

#s45
What did she do with

#s46
if if she

#s47
was she like a group that was doing it

#s48
or was she doing it on her own

#s49
and what did she do with the

#s54
Uh-huh

#s59
You you have to really want to do it though

#s61
This is

#s62
even even what you recycle

#s63
because we we do the the plastics and the and the aluminum and the glass and the paper

#s67
And um and of course then you know you try to buy right too

#s68
but Um a lot of our neighbors say well what you have to rinse out this

#s69
and you have to make sure it 's that

#s70
and you have to

#s74
it 's uh we we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans

#s77
And I thought what are you complaining about when you 're only going to get picked up once a month you know or once a week

#s80
and

#s82
Rather than work with it

#s84
Yeah

#s90
Well it 's for everybody 's benefit

#s91
I mean it 's it 's not

#s92
so maybe we do n't realize it in our lifetime

#s93
but we you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren

#s95
and what kind of quality of life are you leaving them

#s99
And and the and I have a real concern about that

#s102
Uh

#s105
We 've never had much trash

#s106
because wh- while

#s107
I was raised in a big family

#s108
and and Gene 's family was n't big

#s110
but they were n't rich

#s112
and they had to to recycle

#s114
And and you know the fu-

#s115
well they did n't

#s116
they just used things

#s117
they did n't throw things away before they were used up

#s120
and

#s127
Uh-huh

#s132
Yeah

#s133
Right

#s137
Right

#s141
Right

#s143
They 've picked up the hab-

#s144
Well they do

#s145
and when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things Th- and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this

#s146
and dad used to do that

#s152
and pretty soon they 're they 're figuring out that 's not such a bad way to go

#s153
But

#s162
Right

#s163
Well see this this is what concerns me

#s164
You

#s165
over in Europe they do n't have the kind of waste we do here

#s168
You you 've got to be in a country

#s169
even in in Mexico you do n't see things thrown away like we do here

#s174
I mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king 's ransom to most people

#s177
and I

#s178
and even to people in our country who scavenge for food

#s180
and and and I I think you have to get into a period of need bef-

#s184
you ca n't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they 've got to be careful

#s188
This is uh I this is why I thought Jimmy Carter was never very po- very pos-

#s190
you know people did n't like him

#s191
Because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that

#s197
And and uh the pe- I nobody wanted to hear it

#s204
It 's

#s206
Uh-huh

#s208
Uh-huh

#s211
Right

#s213
Uh-huh

#s215
Um

#s216
Right

#s219
Uh-huh

#s220
uh-huh

#s223
Right

#s225
Huh

#s226
I I think the big question too we 're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled

#s229
That 's that 's right

#s230
and and uh do we have to wait until all the landfills are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage

#s235
Or and I do n't

#s236
with the mind set of the American public I think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash That is n't that is n't harmful

#s241
Or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean

#s245
That 's the way we solve problems

#s247
And it 's sad
