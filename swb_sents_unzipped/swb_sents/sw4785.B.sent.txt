#s1
kids too

#s3
Oh you laugh

#s4
How many

#s5
what ages

#s9
You 've been through the fun part

#s12
I have a four and a half and a three

#s15
So It 's

#s16
I I 'm sure there 's a lot of differences in the way in the way it 's done now and then

#s20
Yeah

#s22
Yeah

#s24
What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest

#s26
So they were all real close

#s28
That 's tough

#s29
That 's a lot of time

#s32
Did you both work Your wife too

#s35
Uh well qualify that

#s37
She worked at home I 'm sure

#s40
But that 's

#s41
well both my husband and I work

#s42
and sometimes I feel like you know by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening

#s44
Maybe thirty minutes max

#s46
And well he spends a lot of time with them while I 'm cooking

#s47
and then I spend time with them while you know he 's doing other stuff

#s48
And and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend

#s49
You know there 's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it

#s50
but it 's neat

#s51
it 's straight

#s52
and I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids you know

#s56
Well I 've accepted that too

#s58
That 's true

#s59
It is

#s60
Yeah

#s61
That 's true

#s63
Well that 's true

#s64
and and we do a lot of that on the weekends you know

#s65
We try to spend Saturdays together

#s67
If my husband golfs you know he 'll do it during nap time

#s68
things like that where they 're not really missing the presence you know

#s70
And and we do a lot of family things together

#s71
We 're we 're kind of going the other direction this weekend

#s72
We 're planning a trip just he and I

#s73
This is the first time we 've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago

#s77
Well I decided that you know you need that once in awhile That you you need to plan the quality time

#s78
and and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you do n't have to be there twenty-four hours a day

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Sure

#s84
Sure

#s86
And they think that 's a family activity you know

#s88
Yeah

#s89
That 's great fun

#s92
My daughter 's like Mommy can I help you with the laundry

#s93
Of course you can

#s96
Absolutely

#s97
Yeah

#s99
Uh-huh

#s100
And what would you do

#s101
what

#s104
Oh

#s107
Yeah

#s109
So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week

#s112
and then

#s113
Oh

#s116
I imagine

#s117
And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them

#s120
I

#s121
Oh that 's wonderful

#s122
See I was raised in that type of family where you know you do n't disobey me you mind me

#s123
but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it

#s125
Yeah

#s128
Uh-huh

#s131
Uh well

#s133
Yeah

#s134
yeah

#s135
You do n't think of it that way do you

#s138
Now that 's good

#s139
I like that idea

#s142
Whatever was voted on huh

#s145
Well I think that 's great

#s147
Yeah

#s149
Yeah

#s152
I I think that 's true

#s153
I can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment

#s155
And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know

#s157
So I do think it 's right that they 're harder on themselves you know

#s160
Oh why is that
