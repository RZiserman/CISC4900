#s1
Oh so

#s4
Well it

#s5
let 's put it this way

#s6
We 've got the New England Patriots up here

#s7
so

#s10
They 've had some serious problems in the past couple of years

#s12
Yeah

#s14
Um well uh partly due to ownership

#s15
You know uh Victor Kiam owned the uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years

#s17
and he always had this uh this wonderful quality of c- being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something

#s18
and uh they 've had some financial problems with the team and so forth

#s19
And it recently was sold to uh some other people

#s20
so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England area anyways

#s23
Oh yeah

#s24
I 've been to a couple I 've been to a few games before

#s26
Now you you 're you 're from Texas

#s28
So you 've got two football teams down there

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Oh I see

#s35
There 's that type of segregation huh

#s38
Wow

#s42
Uh-huh

#s44
Do you

#s46
Uh-huh

#s48
Do you follow professional sports at all

#s52
Yeah

#s55
Well it 's a good past time you know

#s57
Particularly football

#s58
They say uh i- football attracts more men because of the you know y- the you see the the physical aggression on the field

#s59
and supposedly psychologists say that uh that uh men take out their frustrations by watching football

#s60
and you know they get together with a bunch of guys

#s61
and they uh uh and they have a good time and everything

#s62
and that 's suppose to be some of the uh the male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts I guess or something about the uh

#s64
Well no

#s65
It it 's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest

#s67
I think that uh I personally like hockey better because it has contact it 's a contact sport

#s68
It has the speed

#s70
And the hand eye coordination

#s71
and it takes a certain skill to play hockey

#s72
Not everybody can play hockey

#s74
So we

#s75
and

#s76
that 's

#s77
we 're a big hockey area up here

#s78
I bet up here in New England as well as you know in in the Minnesota area

#s80
but

#s82
What hockey

#s88
No

#s89
there 's no hockey

#s90
there 's no

#s93
There 's no professional hockey teams in in Texas MUMBLEx

#s99
Yeah

#s100
I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now

#s102
Like they have this World Football League

#s103
You see

#s104
we have the N F L that that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams

#s106
There are those teams that play in professional National Football League

#s107
but uh now they have what 's called the World Football League

#s108
and they have all these teams from

#s109
there 's a team in London

#s110
and there 's a team there there 's uh teams other European teams

#s112
and there 's teams in the United States

#s113
an- and they 're playing now during the summer months

#s114
and it 's really you know overkill

#s116
And there 's only so much football you can watch

#s120
Yeah

#s121
that 's good

#s127
Yeah

#s130
Uh-huh

#s132
Now have you ever been to a professional football game

#s135
Have you

#s139
Did you do the whole big th- the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole

#s142
Well see now see that 's what you got to do see

#s143
Now we talked our

#s145
Yeah

#s146
yeah

#s148
You the

#s149
well the same thing

#s151
We we talked our wives

#s152
there 's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games

#s153
And uh we talked our wives into going with us one time

#s154
and they had a real good time

#s155
and it was basically for the social atmosphere

#s158
You go you know three or four hours before the game

#s159
You go set up

#s160
We set a table up

#s161
we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more

#s163
But but that whole

#s164
it it 's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself

#s165
but it 's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game

#s166
I-

#s168
that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with with a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know

#s170
you you miss that

#s173
And and any professional sport I think you miss that

#s175
The atmosphere of being there you know

#s179
Yep

#s183
Well foot-
