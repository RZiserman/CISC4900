Hi

#s5
this is Laurie

#s6
and I 'm in Garland

#s9
Sure

#s14
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s21
Right

#s22
Well we do n't have any children

#s23
but we 're going to have one next year

#s25
Thanks

#s26
So um that 's something that I 'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future

#s28
We have n't quite decided if I 'm going to

#s29
I 'm working part time now

#s30
and I do n't know if I 'll be doing that or what we 're going to do

#s32
But if we do then I 'm going to need to find somebody

#s33
and our church has a Mother 's Day Out program which they started last year

#s35
and we know a lot of people at the church

#s36
so I would feel very confident with leaving my child there

#s42
Uh-huh

#s45
Uh-huh

#s47
Okay

#s48
Uh-huh

#s51
Uh-huh

#s53
Time uh-huh

#s59
Uh-huh

#s61
Right

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Um you know it 's kind of scary I guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately

#s65
and so it 's I guess it 's such a growing concern

#s66
but then there 's a lot of good things you do n't hear

#s70
Right

#s72
To children

#s73
Right

#s78
Uh-huh

#s80
Right

#s81
Right

#s83
Yeah

#s85
Yeah

#s86
We 're pretty excited

#s89
Yeah

#s90
but that you know we have been thinking about that

#s91
but it 's a little ways off in the future

#s93
but um I figure you know I 'd probably start asking around at church because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be before they you know before you can bring them in

#s97
Uh-huh

#s103
Um

#s106
Right

#s108
Uh-huh
