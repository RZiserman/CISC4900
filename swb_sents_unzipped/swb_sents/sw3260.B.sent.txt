#s2
Uh yes

#s3
Uh we have two sons

#s4
Uh one 's a freshman in college

#s5
and one 's a sophomore in high school

#s7
And you

#s9
Okay

#s11
Oh

#s13
Yes

#s14
Yes

#s15
Uh Yeah

#s21
Uh well uh yeah

#s22
We 've spend a lo- spend a did spend a lot of time uh

#s23
it really helped when the uh older one was old enough to get his license and could uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole n- other set of problems

#s28
But uh uh fo-

#s29
yeah

#s30
for one thing

#s31
Uh but yeah

#s32
we uh we do

#s33
but our two had had uh totally different interests of

#s34
but the- there was not much uh overlap as such

#s35
The the older one is not was not at all into uh sports for the most part

#s36
Uh he participated

#s37
band and and uh scouts were his two big things

#s40
And uh and the yeah younger one is uh uh the sports one

#s41
and the whatever season it is he 's he 's playing although football is really his favorite

#s43
Yeah

#s44
So uh yeah

#s45
we spend a lot of time uh uh carpooling and uh you know and then trying to be uh up as much as possible with anything that they that they do

#s47
But then uh we also did n't do spend uh time with them trying to trying to

#s48
uh you know just family time

#s50
Uh we had a

#s51
at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth

#s52
And and uh uh but we did n't uh do it as much or as often as uh I would have liked to

#s53
I would like to do that as a as a family and and some T V watching

#s55
What about you

#s57
Yeah

#s58
I 've I 've heard of that

#s60
I 've never actually never actually played it

#s61
But

#s68
Yeah

#s69
yeah

#s73
Yeah

#s76
Yeah

#s79
Yeah

#s80
so do we

#s83
Okay

#s84
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s92
Oh now that 's neat

#s95
Yeah

#s96
No

#s97
we 've never had anything like that

#s99
Yeah

#s104
Uh-huh

#s106
Uh-huh

#s107
Oh well good

#s108
Well I you know in terms of in terms of any sorts of trends I you know

#s109
obv- obviously things are different from for me than and my children than when I was growing up

#s111
I I I grew up on a farm uh in Iowa

#s112
and uh you know the whole family was around the the whole time

#s113
And then what my father did was was uh in- you know obvious to me

#s114
and I I helped out with it

#s115
But uh although I have brought my boys into to see where I work it 's not that easy

#s116
and it 's it 's certainly not at all common

#s117
and they they just do n't really have that same idea

#s119
so th- they uh

#s120
it 's a it 's a whole different uh kind of thing there then uh

#s123
Yeah

#s126
Yeah

#s127
Yeah

#s128
Well that makes it hard though for in terms of you know family time with with him

#s131
Yeah

#s132
I 've been lucky in that respect that I do n't uh do n't travel too much

#s134
Oh

#s136
Yeah

#s139
Yes

#s142
Yeah

#s145
Yeah

#s146
Yeah

#s148
Yeah

#s149
Yeah

#s150
right
