#s1
All right

#s2
I 've never done it before

#s3
so I guess that 's all I have to do right

#s5
I 've been called several times

#s6
and I push in pushed in my number

#s7
they kept saying you have the invalid code

#s9
and then I found out that my new phone was n't working right

#s11
Oh so this is the first time I 've even done it

#s13
I wonder how long it 's going to be on for

#s15
Oh no

#s16
I mean this whole thing

#s17
like for two months or something

#s18
do you know

#s20
Yeah

#s21
okay

#s22
well back to crime

#s23
I guess we 're supposed to talk about that

#s24
They say what aspect are you worried about

#s25
well I think at this point I for one am worried about every aspect

#s29
I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that 's really a something you got to protect yourself from

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
golly

#s33
I know

#s35
Have they done that in Garland

#s39
Now um

#s41
Right

#s43
Well we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the you know on the school grounds after school

#s45
And the one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school

#s46
so you know these kids do n't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood does n't seem like

#s51
So

#s52
Yeah

#s53
it 's kind of scary to think you send your child to school

#s54
and you wonder if he 's going to get shot

#s55
I mean we did n't have to worry about that before

#s57
What next

#s62
Right

#s63
and you know we ca n't really depend on the police to solve all this

#s64
they just ca n't do it

#s66
I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent

#s68
and and how we going to bring that back together

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
Right

#s77
and

#s79
I think so

#s80
and and then there 's a drop in uh the training of morals really you know

#s83
These some of these young kids you read about just does n't bother them to kill someone at all

#s85
I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals you know would n't kill somebody in cold blood

#s89
I think it was just rare

#s90
I really do

#s92
My mother well she 's like seventy-four now She when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in California

#s93
and she was dating this millionaire 's son

#s94
and he wanted to marry her

#s95
and she would n't marry him

#s96
and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both

#s97
and uh

#s99
No

#s100
I 'm the one

#s102
Yeah

#s103
that must have been at least fifty years ago or more

#s104
but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks

#s107
but now you know you would n't probably read about it here in Texas

#s109
it 's just you know another killing

#s113
Uh-huh

#s116
Um

#s117
Uh-huh

#s118
Uh-huh

#s119
Right

#s120
lots of their picture and life story and everything

#s124
Uh-huh

#s126
Right

#s128
Right

#s129
I know

#s130
how we MUMBLEx and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible

#s132
So uh that story I just told you about my mother 's beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in Arlington when was it I think it was oh it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with

#s134
Yeah

#s135
I think it was on a Hard Copy

#s136
she was a real attractive blond girl in in her freshman year of college

#s138
and some boy she tried to get rid of he was like in his twenties

#s140
Remember that

#s142
Right

#s143
right

#s144
that 's uh

#s146
My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School

#s148
Yeah

#s149
can you believe it

#s150
that 's just uh

#s153
Taco Bueno

#s154
right

#s155
uh-huh

#s157
Uh-huh

#s158
Right

#s160
Yeah uh

#s161
is n't that weird

#s164
I know

#s165
and uh the police are not going to do anything until they they 've committed some sort of a crime

#s166
You know he was just begging her on the phone

#s167
that 's not doing anything

#s169
And there are times I think gee I MUMBLEx should give my kids gu-
