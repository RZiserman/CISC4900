#s1
Uh well I 'm not sure how it is in Georgia

#s2
but in in Pittsburgh the r- the crime rate really is not very high at the moment

#s3
Is that is that true for for Atlanta

#s8
Yeah

#s9
I

#s10
that 's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere

#s14
Well uh the least what from what 's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences

#s15
What 's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store or a car theft you know it things of that nature

#s16
Very few uh assaults

#s17
although on the college campuses uh there are uh cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners

#s19
But mostly petty things and n- no nothing nothing really too big

#s23
Right

#s27
Uh-huh

#s29
Yeah

#s30
uh a strange case that uh that happened oh it 's about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine

#s32
It was a free standing machine

#s33
and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it

#s36
Now there 's a crime for you

#s39
Yeah

#s40
but uh I guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous

#s41
Although uh from what I hear in the news

#s42
and and I I s- saw an episode of the T V show COPS uh one time that was in Pittsburgh

#s44
and uh it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that

#s45
but I I do n't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what 's reported in the news at least it 's it 's not all that common

#s51
Yeah

#s55
Yeah

#s58
You know I just to diverge a little bit uh I live in an apartment

#s59
Right now I 'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh

#s60
and uh the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in

#s62
But even so it I mean it 's it 's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out you know and things like that

#s65
Uh it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they 're not just come in you know

#s67
there 's a T V and a V C R

#s68
and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they 're upstairs playing music

#s70
it could still happen then
