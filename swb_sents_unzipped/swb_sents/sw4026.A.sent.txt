So How 's your products been

#s4
I hear that one

#s5
Have you had any lately go out

#s12
Oh wow

#s15
So you did n't get anything

#s16
even all the all the warranties were out

#s23
You 're kidding

#s25
Yeah

#s26
we just moved into a new house too

#s27
so we had to buy all those too

#s29
Yeah

#s30
the only thing I 've had problems with is um

#s31
I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail

#s33
and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it 's nontoxic and such

#s34
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings

#s35
So

#s37
I did n't return it because it 'd probably cost me more than

#s38
I just ended up using it

#s39
But that 's about the only thing I 've had gone wrong

#s40
But

#s45
That 's incredible

#s50
And they all went out at the same time

#s52
Or two days

#s53
Wow

#s61
Wow

#s62
it 's frustrating

#s65
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s70
they go out a lot

#s78
Yeah

#s79
See I 'm in the manufacturing MUMBLEx

#s80
home from work

#s81
and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags

#s83
Yeah

#s85
At Morton International

#s86
and I thin-

#s87
well it 's it 's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment

#s88
We test everything after each assembly process

#s89
and so our testing is pretty thorough

#s90
but

#s92
Um

#s96
Um the tests that

#s97
well we test every one electrically

#s98
We do n't

#s99
I think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags

#s101
and but we do test after during the assembly project product um

#s102
after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it 's there after we install it

#s103
so each assembly process has an inspection right after it 's done

#s104
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process

#s105
so

#s109
Yeah

#s114
Well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government

#s115
it 's incredible how much testing they have to do

#s119
Uh-huh
