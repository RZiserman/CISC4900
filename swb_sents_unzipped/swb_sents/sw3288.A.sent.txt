Hi

#s2
So uh what was the last car repair you had

#s4
Oh

#s10
Oh no

#s11
Did you crack the block or what

#s18
Yeah

#s19
I see

#s20
You got lucky you did n't ruin the whole engine though

#s23
That can be pretty serious

#s27
Oh I guess it 's been awhile for me

#s28
I 'd sa-

#s29
it 's been about a year

#s31
Yeah

#s32
I had the uh the water pump break on my car

#s34
Yeah

#s35
I was traveling

#s36
uh I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving

#s38
and it broke like in the middle of nowhere

#s40
So I had to get it towed and then fixed

#s41
and

#s43
big pain

#s47
Yeah

#s48
that 's where I was

#s49
Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride

#s55
Yeah

#s64
Yeah

#s65
so is mine

#s69
Yeah

#s70
I 'm hoping mine gets me through

#s71
I got until May until I 'm out

#s72
So when I cross that one I 'll be okay

#s78
Oh that 's nice

#s84
Yeah

#s87
Yeah

#s88
I do n't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is

#s89
and it 's not worth it

#s95
Yeah

#s103
Yeah

#s104
I got new tires last winter too

#s105
so I 'm like well that 's the last major purchase for this thing

#s106
It 's not worth it

#s111
Yeah

#s113
Yeah

#s114
we get some killer winters up here in the mountains

#s116
Yeah

#s119
Lot of snow and a lot of cold

#s122
Yeah

#s123
at times there 's a lot of it

#s125
You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance

#s130
Yeah

#s131
I have n't had a big problem with that though

#s133
So I 've been pretty lucky there

#s135
Yeah

#s136
that 's usually pretty good

#s137
You just rinse it off after the winter is over

#s138
and done with it

#s143
Yeah

#s144
I usually like to do most repairs on my own though

#s146
Yeah

#s147
just because that way I know what 's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really does n't

#s150
Yeah

#s151
Plus if something goes wrong I know who to blame

#s163
More fun things to do

#s170
Well that 's nice

#s173
Yeah

#s176
One is bad enough

#s184
Yeah

#s185
I was just wondering that

#s187
Yeah

#s188
I did n't either

#s191
Yeah

#s192
this must be a a hard category
