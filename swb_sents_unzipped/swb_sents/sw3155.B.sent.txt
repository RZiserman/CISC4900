#s5
Oh well that 's

#s6
we rent a lot of videos too

#s8
Uh we saw

#s9
I have two little babies

#s10
and we saw one movie recently

#s11
and that was THE TERMINATOR movie uh which I did n't like after all

#s17
Well I do n't either

#s18
It

#s19
on all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he does n't kill anybody in the movie

#s20
He does n't

#s21
He maims them

#s24
So

#s27
Uh-huh

#s28
He he uh I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part In the movie

#s31
So

#s34
Oh I have n't seen that one yet

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Oh

#s42
Yeah

#s43
well With all the commercials and everything

#s45
I have n't

#s46
that 's one we want to see

#s47
I I want to see uh DANCES WITH WOLVES

#s49
But we have n't seen that one yet either

#s54
Yeah

#s55
th- that 's what I heard too

#s56
Yeah

#s57
we 've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it

#s59
So We saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone OSCAR

#s62
Supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy

#s64
Which was an interesting movie but not very funny

#s69
Did she

#s71
Well it was it was an amusing movie

#s73
It j-

#s74
I guess maybe it would have been better if we 'd have been at the theater as opposed to uh just at the house watching it with with no one else around

#s77
So

#s82
Oh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
My son just turned two

#s85
and so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie

#s88
LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think are are his two favorites that we 've got

#s92
Oh I have n't I did n't hear that was coming out

#s97
Well they just had uh THE RESCUERS movie

#s100
that was a Disney movie was n't it

#s101
I think I heard that was just one was just out

#s102
He 's uh he does n't sit still for the whole movie yet

#s103
but he likes to uh to listen to the music and stuff if there 's a lot of that in the m- in the movie

#s107
Well I w- tell you

#s108
ever s-

#s109
my my kids are just small babies

#s110
and I tell you

#s111
we really want to go a lot

#s113
and uh there 's so much out on video now that it 's almost you know

#s114
the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it Sometimes

#s118
So

#s119
Uh-huh

#s120
That seems to happen

#s121
I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the uh Granada Theater

#s123
And uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do

#s124
You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie

#s125
I thought that might be kind of fun to do

#s128
And of course you need a baby-sitter for that

#s129
Definitely

#s130
But uh no

#s131
I 'd really like to get out to the movies more often

#s132
Course it 's so expensive now too that you ca n't hardly afford it

#s134
I I know we get discount tickets where my husband works

#s136
but other than that it just seems like it 's so expensive

#s137
And then the popcorn and everything else

#s138
you almost ca n't afford to do it No matter what

#s140
Although we did actually get

#s141
we went on vacation couple months ago

#s142
and we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB

#s144
That was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray

#s146
That was fun

#s149
Oh he 's a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist

#s150
and Bob is his patient

#s151
and Bob follows him on vacation

#s152
It 's uh

#s154
Uh-huh

#s155
uh-huh

#s157
Uh-huh

#s159
Yeah

#s160
that 's the one

#s170
Must have left an impression
