Uh-huh

#s9
Well here in Saskatoon uh much the same thing

#s10
There is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products

#s11
Uh we 're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people

#s12
Uh there are areas where we could uh

#s13
actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh

#s14
one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers

#s15
so uh we are able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing

#s16
and then there are there 's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers Well primarily soft drink bottles

#s17
and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers

#s18
and then they recycle the containers

#s19
They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container

#s20
and then

#s22
Right

#s24
On the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing

#s26
and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers

#s27
Uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well

#s29
and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those

#s30
So uh it 's fairly fairly extensive

#s31
but then again it 's uh it 's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city

#s36
Well actually there 's there 's the opportunity for both

#s38
Generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that

#s39
actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back

#s40
and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit

#s41
and then I and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well

#s49
Oh yeah

#s50
Uh I guess partly because of our climate

#s51
Here in Saskatoon at least the majority of central uh

#s52
well I want to say Central Canada

#s53
but Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec

#s55
but uh we do n't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people

#s56
We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfa- welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing

#s57
Uh there 's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although uh scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds uh regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes

#s59
They have done it some uh

#s60
but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers

#s61
They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers Like the shopping malls

#s62
There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects

#s63
or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins

#s64
and then the bins are collected

#s66
Uh some of the
