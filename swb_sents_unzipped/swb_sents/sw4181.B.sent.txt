#s2
No

#s3
I would tend to agree very highly

#s4
I think that we 're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it

#s6
Yeah

#s7
we sure do

#s8
Here in Indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax

#s9
we pay five percent sales tax

#s10
uh you name it they tax it

#s12
That 's right

#s13
we

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
Right

#s19
Which is probably pretty nice

#s20
but I 'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high

#s23
There 's no sales tax either

#s26
Uh-huh

#s29
Right

#s30
Taxachusetts

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Right

#s39
Right

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
No

#s44
I uh I really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax

#s45
I worked in a factory uh last summer

#s46
and on the average I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes

#s47
and I do n't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that

#s48
I mean I do n't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services

#s49
Of course I drive on the roads

#s50
and I you know went to the schools and stuff

#s51
but I really feel that that I 'm just getting overtaxed

#s53
Uh-huh

#s54
No

#s55
that 's that 's not any fun

#s58
Uh-huh

#s59
Right

#s61
Right

#s64
Yeah

#s65
which is just outrageous

#s66
and a lot of it

#s67
and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it 's going to waste

#s71
Right

#s74
Right

#s76
Right

#s78
That 's right

#s79
got to keep those farmers happy

#s81
Uh-huh

#s86
Right

#s87
The- there is just way too much bureaucracy

#s88
and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs

#s95
Right

#s96
and a lot of it 's feeding that

#s97
Just I just I really especially in the election year I mean I 'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole

#s98
it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy uh the government goes and our our whole economy in general

#s99
and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens

#s100
and especially when you 've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures uh beyond what any other President since World War Two has done

#s101
and yet he supposedly

#s104
Right

#s105
right

#s106
yeah

#s108
I mean I just read something that two thirds or three quarters I 'm not exactly sure of our national debt are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are suppo- supposedly fiscally conservative

#s114
Right

#s117
Right

#s120
Uh-huh

#s126
That 's right

#s128
Yeah

#s129
it 's really

#s130
that is the

#s131
especially that defense cuts in the defense is really a Catch twenty-two double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that 's great

#s133
that 's going to lower our national expenditures

#s134
but then you 're going to have people on welfare

#s135
and they 're not putting taxes in

#s139
So that 's that 's really

#s140
it 's

#s142
I 'm glad I 'm not the one who has to come up with these policies

#s146
Uh-huh

#s147
Right

#s150
That 's right
