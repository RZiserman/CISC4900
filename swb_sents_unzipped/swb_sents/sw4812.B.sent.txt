Uh I I do n't see any problem with with testing for random drugs

Uh well I 'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon

#s16
And I I just came from Saint Paul Uh interviewing with Three M

#s19
And uh they have a policy for uh testing

#s20
If you if they make you an offer then they 'll test you right before you start

#s22
And I guess the only drawback I can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem
