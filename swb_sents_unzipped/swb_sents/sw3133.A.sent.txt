#s2
Um well I guess first of all I I could have asked that before

#s3
Do you have children

#s5
No

#s6
Okay

#s7
Because I I did n't know if that would make a difference in how you felt

#s9
Um what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two

#s12
Yeah

#s15
I just um

#s16
I guess that 's my that 's something that my family has always believed strongly in

#s17
and uh I had opportunities in high school to work in some programs um

#s20
and and I agree with what you said that it 's uh it benefits the person doing it so much I do n't think they realize

#s22
and I uh I I think it gives you a better perspective on life

#s23
and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world

#s24
and and it would certainly help the country too uh

#s29
Yeah

#s31
Yes

#s32
Yeah

#s33
Well I think sometimes through groups and organizations um

#s34
my first when I first thought of it I thought it uh when they asked the question I thought well that sounds wonderful

#s35
And then I wondered if people were unwilling

#s36
but but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I do n't think it would stay negative very long

#s37
Um but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um they do still have opportunities

#s41
But I I think that 's a small uh number could

#s43
No

#s44
um not since um not as much as I remember growing up

#s45
And that was something uh I think in the fifties and sixties um

#s46
seemed more common in the last two decades

#s50
But

#s52
Yeah

#s53
Yeah

#s54
Where uh where abouts do you live

#s55
What part of the country

#s57
Oh okay

#s58
We 're in Plano

#s59
so we 're not far apart

#s63
One of the calls I 'd gotten before was uh down to Austin

#s64
and and I know a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest

#s65
so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area

#s72
Oh

#s78
Yeah

#s79
Well

#s80
and maybe uh maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back Um if we 've lost some of that

#s81
and it it seems in the last decade or two um that 's true

#s82
maybe that 's a way

#s83
if if young people had to do it um maybe that would start the trend back because that 's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country Um is helping others

#s90
Yeah

#s93
Yeah

#s94
I think uh I think it does help um even preschoolers you know

#s95
they 're um things even just starting around the home You know

#s97
little ones can do a little bit to help the family

#s99
And and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern

#s100
There 's always something no matter how young

#s101
and then that helps develop that attitude

#s102
Um I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more

#s103
You know I think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it

#s104
but I wish MUMBLEx

#s105
that 's something that I think that has been lost in families

#s106
and I think that 's a good place to start again

#s109
Yeah

#s110
And I do think um the schools

#s111
if you 're trying to do something even with food drives

#s112
and uh sometimes what Richardson and Plano both

#s113
I mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is

#s115
I mean that 's uh

#s116
gosh I 'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas

#s117
and uh it 's

#s120
I know our church youth group uh starts with projects young

#s121
but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year

#s123
They 've done this for fourteen years now

#s125
Um and it is it 's uh

#s126
and they 've also see that there 's there 's a different way of life and those families are really close

#s127
Some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there

#s129
and uh it really

#s130
every youth that 's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed

#s131
and it 's changed their perspective

#s132
And and that 's just the t- two weeks during during the summer

#s134
So if two weeks uh could have that kind of effect I would think uh

#s137
Well that 's

#s140
Yes

#s142
Well I guess um

#s143
did you have anything else

#s147
Okay

#s149
Well I enjoyed talking with you

#s151
And I hope you have a good evening

#s153
Thanks

#s155
Bye

#s156
bye
