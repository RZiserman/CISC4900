What kind of car would you like to buy next

#s4
Well why would that be

#s8
Okay

#s9
well that 's good

#s11
If you had uh no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy

#s13
Do you

#s15
Which type of Cadillac uh is your favorite

#s18
The Seville

#s20
That 's a sharp looking car

#s22
That really is

#s23
It it always has been though You know

#s26
it does n't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness

#s27
It never really has

#s28
It 's always had it 's own unique look

#s30
Well I 've always liked that

#s31
I liked the the

#s32
one year they had a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it

#s35
I thought now that looks sharp

#s37
that looks real sharp

#s40
Uh-huh

#s42
Yeah

#s43
and uh the

#s44
I I 've never really uh I 've never ridden in one recently um

#s45
but they 're supposed to be just real smooth

#s47
Just a nice comfortable ride

#s52
Uh-huh

#s55
Right

#s56
Now they 've got a unique fa- uh feature in them now

#s57
If uh if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the e- the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it does n't come through the so it does n't go it does n't go through the you know into the inside

#s58
It 'll go underneath the car instead

#s60
So that 's that 's a big safety factor they 've got in them now

#s63
The air bags

#s64
yeah

#s68
So

#s69
well that 's great

#s70
that 's great

#s73
So you say you 've always have preferred General Motors products MUMBLEx

#s77
Right

#s80
What kind of uh General Motors cars have you had in the past

#s82
Oldsmobiles

#s83
Those are real nice riding cars too

#s89
Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra

#s92
The Ninety-Eight

#s93
okay

#s97
Well I do n't think

#s98
uh let 's see

#s99
the Ninety-Eight

#s100
now that 's got that big V eight engine in it does n't it does n't it

#s103
Has a little V Six

#s105
Okay

#s108
It

#s110
Oh that 's great

#s112
that 's great

#s113
That 's always nice to get uh reliability in a product Especially when you 're spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for for a single item You know

#s115
you just do n't want any hassles with it

#s117
You just you expect it to do its its job

#s118
and I think a lot of a lot of car manufacturers do n't really keep that into consider- do n't take that into consideration you know

#s122
They just expect you to buy their product

#s123
but that 's always been something that 's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car going to be you know

#s125
Price is is an issue

#s126
but it 's not the most important issue

#s130
Right

#s132
Well I 've always been a Ford man myself

#s134
Yes

#s136
But that 's all right

#s139
You know it 's American made too which is good

#s142
Um but I I 've

#s143
ever since I guess I I was growing up my dad 's always had Fords

#s144
and uh well I grew up in South Dakota

#s145
So everybody has a truck

#s147
and my Ford trucks have just

#s148
I 've I 've just never had problems with them

#s150
I honestly think I would die before my truck would keel over on me

#s152
So
