Well I have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music

#s3
In fact it 's easier for me to say uh the types of music that I do n't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal

#s9
Uh-huh

#s11
Oh I do n't mind music that 's difficult to listen to

#s12
but uh the the uh basic point of heavy metal w- which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying

#s15
Uh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh oh you know

#s16
I 'm thirty

#s17
so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and R E M that sort of stuff

#s19
Uh R E M makes me laugh because they 've gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point

#s20
and it 's not really that they 've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed

#s24
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s34
I think it is

#s36
Uh for a while there music seemed to really ha- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it

#s37
I was really tired of uh the Michael Bolton

#s38
Mi- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes

#s40
And I could uh go down to a bar that 's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money

#s43
I guess

#s44
That and a marvelous hairdo

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Well i- it 's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music

#s56
and I like a lot of classical music

#s57
but I also dislike uh some classical music

#s58
and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if if it 's not seventy five years old it has n't stood the test of time

#s63
Uh

#s64
Stuff that I like

#s65
uh I like Bach

#s66
I tolerate Vivaldi

#s67
I ca n't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy

#s68
Uh uh I like Tchaikovsky

#s69
He can make a lot of noise when he 's uh so inclined

#s71
Uh and some of some stuff that I like uh

#s72
for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition

#s74
and that 's interesting music

#s75
but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded uh philharmonic uh just because number one it 's Frank Zappa and he 's weird number two is n't he still alive

#s76
You know we 're we 're much better off playing uh Beethoven 's ninth

#s77
that 's right you know

#s78
w- we 'll do we 'll do the ninth

#s79
and everyone will know it and and hum it

#s81
and i- it it just is n't chance taking enough for me

#s82
Uh I feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if you 've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
