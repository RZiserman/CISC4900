#s1
think about this

#s3
I do

#s5
Uh

#s8
So you see a big difference then in before and now do you

#s9
or

#s10
A lot of testing

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Uh-huh

#s16
I do too

#s17
I oh I think that 's awful

#s21
I know

#s22
What 's the new criteria huh

#s25
We have all kinds of testing

#s26
and it 's over and over

#s27
It 's I T B S or and uh just everything everything

#s29
And they test test test

#s30
I live in Plano actually

#s31
and I do n't know if you 've heard of Plano

#s32
but it 's a very transient community

#s34
A lot of people from everywhere

#s35
it 's just north of Dallas

#s37
and it 's grown in leaps and bounds

#s38
I we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now

#s40
And most of them from other places

#s42
Uh J C Penney 's come down from New York and of course T I and Xerox from Rochester

#s43
and we just have lots of people from everywhere Lots of industry coming in

#s45
and it 's a very wealthy community

#s46
Uh not that I am

#s47
but other people seem to be

#s48
and I would love to know why

#s49
but I mean they do

#s50
They have

#s52
I I would

#s53
I really would

#s54
I mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes

#s55
and they have everything

#s56
The kids only wear name brand things to school

#s57
and it 's one of these things

#s60
Well it does you know

#s61
It really does because I 'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now

#s62
and uh you know it does

#s64
I mean we do it to a point

#s65
but uh not to where she feels different

#s67
but some of them are very rich

#s69
and so uh we just kind of have everything here

#s70
and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are

#s72
And so I do n't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas

#s73
but the kids are expected to excel in everything

#s75
And it 's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody ca n't be first

#s76
and they 're expected to be

#s78
You know their parents expect it

#s79
the teachers expect it

#s80
Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system

#s82
and if you read national surveys they 're far from it

#s83
And so there 's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests

#s86
Well not very well

#s87
They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night 's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests

#s89
I mean they make a big deal

#s90
To me the paper should just be put on the desk that day

#s91
and say just do this

#s92
You know I just feel they do better that way

#s95
And

#s96
Yeah

#s97
And and I have older children too that now are out of high school

#s98
and they 've always done this here

#s99
I mean it 's always been the same

#s100
but it is it 's getting worse and worse

#s101
is more pressure for everything

#s102
And I just think it 's really awful

#s103
and I I 'm with you on that

#s104
You do n't hear too many people say this

#s105
but I think it 's a very long day

#s107
And my feeling is that you know you 're only a kid once and you do n't want to spend your whole life in school

#s111
Uh-huh

#s112
uh-huh

#s115
And I do n't think that 's right

#s116
I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system

#s118
I do n't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano

#s120
I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids

#s124
And so I just find this a real problem

#s125
I think if they 're going to be there all day they should find time

#s126
One of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was

#s127
And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week

#s128
and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead

#s129
So what does that tell you

#s131
It tells you there 's a whole lot of wasted time

#s134
And they could be using this time better

#s139
Uh-huh

#s141
That 's a very long day for kindergartners

#s143
But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this

#s145
You know because they do n't they do n't want to send them to daycare

#s147
That 's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day

#s149
We have them at one school like
