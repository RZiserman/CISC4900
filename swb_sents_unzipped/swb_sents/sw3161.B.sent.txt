Than

#s12
well that 's interesting is n't it

#s13
yeah

#s24
Right

#s28
What did you think about that idea

#s34
They 've not really given it attention either

#s35
yeah

#s42
Right

#s50
Well I 'm I 'm glad I 'm not the one that 's that 's in charge of of making those decisions

#s51
They uh you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they 're all so serious you know

#s52
I mean it 's not so serious I guess until it affects your family

#s53
and then all of a sudden it 's the most important thing

#s55
So I I would hate to have that responsibility just personally

#s56
but but then again we really we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address

#s57
I uh I guess I it it frightens me to think of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer

#s58
and many of those things uh if they 're not able to to be insured then the country 's going to pay for it one way or the other Whether it 's through prevention or or treatment or you know just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves

#s60
It seems like one way or the other we 're going to end up paying for it

#s62
But

#s72
Just change our p-

#s75
Right

#s76
just change our priorities a little bit

#s82
Right
