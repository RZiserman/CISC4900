Have you had that experience recently

#s7
Oh yeah

#s9
Oh

#s16
Well I do n't have so much trouble with products as service

#s18
I do n't feel like that 's as big a problem

#s19
I 've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I 've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly

#s21
And I 'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent

#s23
Uh the one I have now is okay most of the time

#s25
But that 's it

#s26
But that 's that 's probably the worst

#s27
My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that 's guaranteed

#s28
Uh James Avery

#s29
I do n't know if you have that up there

#s30
but it it 's a very good company That sells sterling silver things

#s32
and uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now

#s35
and the catch broke

#s36
and she was sitting in school on a carpet

#s37
and when she stood up it caught and broke

#s38
and we took it back

#s39
and they said oh this was just obviously yanked

#s41
This was yanked

#s42
I mean they were so rude about it

#s44
And so we wanted a different kind of catch

#s45
and she said well it 's not guaranteed

#s46
And I said well put it on because apparently nothing 's guaranteed

#s47
so do it anyway

#s49
So we got the kind we wanted

#s50
and I was really disappointed with that

#s51
I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable

#s53
and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends

#s54
and I called there to see if they had it

#s55
and the lady was very nice

#s56
And I said my goodness

#s57
I said you 've been very nice

#s58
what 's your name

#s59
And she told me

#s60
and I said well I really appreciate it

#s61
I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store

#s62
and it turned out she was the assistant manager

#s63
so

#s65
Right

#s66
So I felt kind of good about that you know

#s67
I did n't even know the person 's name that had given me the hard time or anything

#s70
but I just felt like well at least I did something

#s71
Maybe they 'll fix it

#s72
They might work on that you know

#s75
But I find attitudes are more of a problem

#s76
Service is more of a problem

#s81
Really

#s88
That 's really great

#s96
Huh

#s100
That 's really good

#s101
It use to be like that

#s103
But

#s104
I do n't think most places are like that anymore
