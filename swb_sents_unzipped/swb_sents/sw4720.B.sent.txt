#s4
Right

#s8
Oh and if you try to get it outside of your corporation you 're going to pay an arm and a leg

#s11
Right

#s14
Uh do you also get dental

#s20
Oh I know

#s22
Now my husband is with uh Northwest Airlines

#s23
and he gets uh you know the full health and dental

#s24
and uh we have four children

#s25
and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous

#s27
And I do n't know how people that do n't have it can afford it

#s30
Or maybe they do n't

#s33
That 's right

#s34
That 's right

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
Right

#s42
Right

#s43
Well it 's a lot easier to to save it when you do n't get your hands on it first

#s47
Right

#s49
Uh what about what about uh lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the corporation

#s50
For example uh oh

#s52
Yeah

#s53
Do they e- even do they have father leaves or anything like that

#s56
Uh-huh

#s58
Oh I do too

#s60
Oh I think I think it 's just a crying shame uh for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks

#s63
She is n't recovered

#s64
And uh the infant needs her desperately at that point and time

#s67
Uh-huh

#s68
Right

#s69
I agree

#s72
Oh sure

#s74
Especially in this day and age

#s76
You do n't want to start over again anywhere

#s80
Well I think they 're at they 're com- they 've come a long way

#s81
Uh

#s82
at least some companies

#s83
Some of them uh

#s84
my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency

#s86
and uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy

#s87
and uh I just do n't know how how women do it

#s88
Particularly single parents who do n't have the support at the other end

#s89
Uh

#s94
That 's right

#s95
That 's exactly right

#s96
Right

#s100
Uh-huh

#s103
One of the benefits we get of course is travel

#s107
It 's wonderful

#s109
The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere

#s110
but you ca n't afford to stay once you get there

#s114
That 's right

#s115
You have to have an awful lot of fun

#s116
just just getting there is has to be half the fun
