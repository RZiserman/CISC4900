Just recently I was kind of laughing when I when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh I had to have my uh radiator flushed

#s5
and it was getting rusty

#s6
And the thing that they forgot to do was to um to also look at the hose

#s7
and I had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed

#s8
and the hose burst

#s9
So I was stranded out on the highway

#s12
No

#s13
I I did n't do that

#s14
thank goodness

#s15
but uh there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that

#s16
but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were going to they had repaired it

#s17
So that was that was a horrible experience just recently

#s21
Yes

#s22
yes

#s24
I know

#s25
I know

#s26
What about you

#s30
Uh-huh

#s33
Oh

#s37
Uh-huh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s42
Uh-huh

#s44
Oh oh I know

#s45
I know

#s46
Especially when you 're out on the highway

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
Uh-huh

#s52
I know

#s53
well you know uh living in Dallas you know we 've got uh bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic

#s54
and uh that was that was horrible

#s56
You know to have the you know

#s57
your car is fuming and everything

#s58
It 's already a hundred degrees

#s59
you do n't need that too

#s60
Oh shoot

#s61
But my car is getting old

#s62
See it 's about six years old now

#s63
so

#s66
Yeah

#s67
so I got it right out of college

#s68
and so it 's uh it 's starting to show the wear and tear now

#s73
Uh-huh

#s74
uh-huh

#s75
Yeah

#s76
that uh that was my graduation present to myself

#s77
so

#s79
Yeah

#s80
Yeah

#s81
I know

#s82
so but gosh it 's really starting to to wear

#s83
so I 've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car

#s85
Go-

#s86
because I ca n't uh I do n't know if I want to you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it 's starting to breakdown

#s90
Uh-huh

#s91
uh-huh

#s92
Yeah

#s93
that 's true

#s94
I agree with you there

#s96
So I do n't know

#s97
uh because I I need to have it tuned you know tuned up and I do n't know replace some of the belts

#s98
And I was looking at

#s99
the uh tires need to be replaced

#s100
and so I was thinking just a lot of money

#s101
I 'm

#s102
might as well buy me a new car for that

#s107
Uh-huh

#s108
Well you have to in Pennsylvania

#s109
boy you have to really have your car winterized and stuff

#s110
huh

#s112
Uh-huh

#s115
Oh really

#s117
Oh okay

#s118
So

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
Well especially do n't you have what a lot of salt on the ground

#s124
Uh-huh

#s126
Yeah

#s127
Yeah

#s128
well rust and the and the body too

#s129
huh

#s132
Uh-huh

#s134
Well I think they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can um

#s139
Uh-huh

#s140
Yeah

#s141
and go like that

#s142
so

#s145
Do you

#s148
Uh-huh

#s149
uh-huh

#s152
Well I I think I 'm getting too old for all that

#s153
My uh I had four brothers

#s154
and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff

#s155
so I can I can do all that stuff

#s156
but I I think I 'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to to go have it done now

#s157
so I can get my hands dirty

#s158
So yeah

#s159
I 'm just getting getting to that age I guess

#s160
You just do n't have

#s161
your time becomes very precious

#s162
so working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore

#s164
Absolutely absolutely

#s165
So yeah

#s166
I 'm trying to you know

#s167
I just need one

#s168
I had two cars there for a while

#s169
so I would n't have to worry about which car was going to run

#s171
And yeah

#s172
so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them

#s174
And yeah

#s175
so that

#s177
Yes

#s178
one was bad enough

#s179
But I think I got rid of the wrong one

#s180
I soon I need a lot of repairs done on on this one

#s181
so yeah

#s182
that was uh that was something else

#s183
Well are our five minutes up

#s186
I I did n't I did n't set the time or anything to uh

#s189
Yeah

#s190
put

#s193
Well yeah

#s194
I guess

#s195
Um you know unless you 're um you know big do-it-yourselfer Um to you know fix up your own cars and and things like that

#s196
So but I guess they were talking about experiences

#s197
You know I uh uh I did

#s198
my parents live in Ohio

#s199
so I I do know something about the you know the really cold weather

#s200
And uh I 've always lived down here in the south

#s201
and oh I took my car up there to their house

#s202
and um I guess I had a crack in the block

#s203
and when I got up there the car

#
