#s2
Well I suppose I 'm supposed to say the Rangers right

#s3
Is that what I-

#s4
is the million dollar question here

#s6
Yeah

#s7
Uh uh you know I would like to say the Rangers

#s8
but unfortunately they 're not

#s9
I was from Illinois

#s10
and my favorite team was the White Sox

#s12
No

#s13
no

#s14
my family my dad was

#s15
but I turned out to be a White Sox fan

#s17
I lived in Chicago

#s19
Yeah

#s20
they did pretty well

#s22
What did you think of the World Series

#s26
Uh-huh

#s33
So you did n't really have a lot of choice did you

#s36
Or country

#s37
Yeah

#s38
Oh uh and I was routing for the Twins myself because uh they a couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here uh went to Minnesota

#s39
and we used to tease about

#s40
my son and I used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota

#s41
but it was int- it certainly was an exciting Series anyway

#s44
What do you think going to happen to the Rangers

#s46
Or can we predict

#s50
Uh-huh

#s55
Uh-huh

#s61
No

#s64
Oh is n't it though

#s65
You know but oh I I think going to the ball park just really makes it Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you 're more a part of it too

#s68
Well I 'm a great sports enthusiast

#s69
so I love you know baseball teams

#s70
and they

#s71
in fact on the news tonight Nolan Ryan was on there

#s72
He was being he was put in the which I never knew existed the Restaurant Hall of Fame

#s74
The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight

#s75
and he uh says he 's coming back you know uh

#s77
he does n't know how many years I mean to pitch

#s79
He 'll be at least one more

#s80
and he said he 's been saying one more and it 's been two and three might be two and three more

#s81
He likes it

#s83
Yeah

#s85
That 's right

#s86
You know and he said I get a kick out of it you know

#s87
he 's he 's such a nice man

#s89
Yeah

#s90
and he you know

#s91
when he quits at being active he will go into you know being a managing and yeah you know being a coach I 'm sure

#s94
But he 's uh he certainly is a good example uh for the kids

#s96
You know you like to have someone like that you could point to say see what a fine man that he is

#s99
That 's right

#s101
Uh-huh

#s103
Oh he 's been a legend for so many years you know

#s104
and I do n't know

#s105
were you here had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son

#s106
His son pitched for U T

#s107
and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers

#s110
Yeah

#s111
it was a

#s112
I think it was a little early part of the summer

#s113
and uh Nolan against

#s116
Ryan against Ryan

#s117
yeah

#s118
his son pitched for U T

#s120
and uh only uh Ryan did n't want too much publicity on it because he did n't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing

#s122
A game is a game you know

#s123
Well the Rangers really uh knocked the socks off of them which you would expect you know anyway

#s125
but Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something you know of the game

#s126
so
