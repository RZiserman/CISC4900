#s4
Right

#s8
Yeah

#s16
Where where do you usually go

#s19
Uh-huh

#s22
Uh-huh

#s24
Uh-huh

#s29
Right

#s32
Uh-huh

#s36
Right

#s37
We are uh we have not had a vacation in several years

#s38
so be our first chance in awhile uh

#s39
we are going to go to uh Destin Florida which is a very nice beach area if you are not familiar with it

#s42
Oh it 's it 's gorgeous

#s43
Uh we used to go quite a bit uh before I moved out here

#s44
We were closer and uh used to go almost every summer uh and rent a condo there on the beach

#s45
Uh there 's quite a few uh there 's a lot of development of of condominiums there on the beach front

#s47
And uh so they have uh they are very very large condos

#s48
And they have quite a few rooms

#s49
and uh so we we will usually rent one for about a week or so

#s50
And

#s53
go down

#s54
Oh

#s56
Yes

#s57
it 's uh it 's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a lot of nice waves usually uh

#s60
enough enough to make it

#s61
I am sorry

#s63
Uh there 's not as many sea shells along there uh

#s64
that 's the only thing that they really do not

#s65
they have some but not not so much

#s67
Um if you go further down uh you will usually find some but not right in there

#s68
Uh I do not know why it is

#s69
but uh it just

#s70
it seems not it seems not to have as many there right there

#s71
But uh we we enjoy it uh

#s72
it 's

#s73
the place where we stay is we usually stay at the same place every year

#s74
and they are like I say right on the beach

#s75
So

#s79
It 's a place called Jetty East uh J E T T Y E A S T

#s80
and it 's uh called that because it 's at the very end of uh a jetty there which is uh sort of at the end of this little little point

#s82
and uh it 's a at the very end

#s83
it 's the last set of condominiums there

#s84
and it 's uh it 's very nice Uh

#s85
it 's not very expensive uh

#s86
you can

#s87
I think we are going to go with another couple and their kids

#s88
And uh they have a we have a uh I think it 's three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep I do not know quite a few about six or eight And uh cause it 's got you know pull out couches and all that

#s90
and uh I think it 's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week

#s92
Yeah

#s93
it really is

#s94
because uh the uh you know it has got its own kitchen full size kitchen and everything

#s96
And this one I think has two baths

#s97
and it 's

#s98
the one we got is on the on the beach side

#s99
So

#s101
We have got a beautiful view and balcony

#s102
and uh just

#s103
you know it 's really a nice stay

#s104
Uh

#s105
in fact we stayed there on our honeymoon

#s106
we I had won a trip to the Bahamas but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time

#s107
so we instead went there uh and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the Bahamas

#s108
We in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked

#s110
the uh the particular ro- uh uh uh suite we had gotten was very nice

#s111
and so we decided to stay

#s114
But uh it 's a pretty nice place

#s115
you will need to try to go and stay there sometime

#s117
It 's a little far from here

#s118
but uh

#s120
Yeah

#s121
we are

#s122
We are

#s123
it will take uh a day and a half to get there probably

#s125
So

#s130
Uh-huh

#s133
Uh what does what does that mean alternate

#s136
Oh

#s137
Uh-huh

#s139
Right

#s141

#s143
Kind of scattering the vacation out throughout the year

#s145
