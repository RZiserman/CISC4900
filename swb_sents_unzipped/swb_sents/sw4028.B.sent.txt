Uh I would say the medical uh group insurance area as far as uh covering medical costs for yourself or family members

#s8
Yeah

#s9
I think

#s10
I work for a public school system district

#s12
and uh so it 's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing

#s13
where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs

#s15
But overall um I 've been pleased with it over the years

#s17
I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies

#s18
or now we 're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any

#s21
How about yourself

#s24
Uh-huh

#s27
Right

#s28
yeah

#s30
Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year or calendar years

#s31
and I was in the H M O

#s32
and um I was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh

#s33
they usually sign a contract or something

#s35
and um uh I did have surgery last summer

#s36
and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day

#s37
and I 've never seen another bill

#s38
so I I have to say it really works

#s40
But again I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it

#s41
Uh if you 've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people

#s49
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s55
Right

#s56
but if you you know have a family and and um everybody 's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history

#s57
and you feel comfortable with it

#s59
I I 'm sure it would be very stressful

#s60
and my husband and I have just elected that if that happens I will go and just pay

#s61
You can continue to go to your own doctor

#s63
but your benefits are not as you know good

#s64
so uh

#s69
Oh all right

#s71
I do too

#s72
Are you talking about like Spring Break

#s73
and

#s75
Right

#s78
Right

#s79
It it really um

#s80
I do n't think most of our teachers

#s81
now I 'm not a teacher

#s82
I am a secretarial executive assistant

#s83
but I do n't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly

#s85
It is just Texas has really um you know

#s86
they want everybody educated no matter what it costs

#s87
uh and it it would be just

#s88
we all look forward to

#s89
like in two weeks we have Spring Break

#s90
and I do n't know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff

#s93
What do you do there

#s97
Okay

#s100
Well that 's good

#s101
Yeah

#s102
I would think that that type of employment you 're you 're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little luke warm or something

#s104
and um it 's good that they allow you that

#s106
It um

#s107
as I say the schools

#s108
now we do have to work you know the day

#s109
but we do get many days off

#s110
and uh we all look forward to it

#s112
That 's the only reason I work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college

#s113
but at the time I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs

#s116
and uh I 've just continued to uh stay there MUMBLEx
