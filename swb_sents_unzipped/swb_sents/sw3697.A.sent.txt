Okay

#s2
now then you heard the question

#s3
what what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs

#s7
Okay

#s12
Um

#s13
Well

#s17
Is that the reason you 're not doing it

#s18
or are you so busy you do n't have time to do it

#s20
Uh

#s23
Okay

#s24
Well being a female and being alone you I do n't do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even

#s26
But uh have you had any major repairs recently

#s31
Oh

#s33
Okay

#s34
Well you should be feel very fortunate

#s35
I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile

#s37
and I 'll declare

#s38
that 's an expensive

#s40
Yes

#s41
uh-huh

#s42
Maybe I should have just traded the car in

#s45
Oh it just

#s46
well I have a very comfortable car

#s47
and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car

#s50
So um anyway I have a new transmission

#s51
and I 'm sure that any of them would have cost al- or charged me almost the same amount

#s52
But

#s54
it hurts it hurts real bad

#s56
No

#s57
I took it to an independent out in Garland

#s60
I had um

#s61
these people were recommended by a neighbor

#s63
and you know that 's the only thing

#s64
I am not a native of Dallas

#s66
So that means I have to depend on on trustworthy friends

#s68
and that 's

#s69
Anyway it 's fixed

#s70
it 's running

#s71
and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it

#s73
Uh-huh

#s75
Oh I know it

#s76
It certainly is frightening

#s77
What work are you in

#s79
Oh

#s81
Okay

#s82
okay

#s84
No

#s87
No

#s88
I have just retired from um the Southwest Medical Center

#s90
Yeah where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car

#s91
but they 're all too busy

#s92
So

#s94
I have to do it the other way

#s95
and that 's find someone and pay them to do it

#s98
So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year

#s103
Oh it could be

#s104
but I do n't much think so

#s108
I 'm well we 're starting out a new one

#s109
so let 's make it a good one

#s112
Okay

#s114
Thank you

#s116
Bye

#s117
Bye-bye
