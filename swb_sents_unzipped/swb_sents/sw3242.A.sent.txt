#s1
Well how did you like that topic

#s4
Do you

#s5
I do n't

#s8
No

#s9
I 'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know

#s10
I agree with it

#s11
I think uh I think a company should be able to test at any any employee any time they see fit

#s13
I just I just do n't think there 's a place in our environment you know in the work force for drugs or alcohol either

#s16
Right

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Uh-huh

#s21
You did

#s23
Uh-huh

#s24
Well I can sort of understand that uh

#s25
but not being a teacher as you are you know I I was not quite as sympathetic as you know as I probably would have been if if Kay were a teacher or something

#s27
But uh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
That 's right

#s33
That 's right

#s35
Uh that 's right

#s36
and I think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know

#s38
but uh

#s40
Yeah

#s41
I think so too

#s42
I I agree with it

#s43
Uh I know Kay 's company you know

#s44
they started it couple of years ago

#s45
and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know

#s46
and I thought Jeez to me it 's quite simple

#s47
uh you either need a job

#s48
or you do n't

#s49
The the job is what provides all of your needs

#s50
and uh if they say Hey you ca n't do this work I 'd say Hey I agree

#s51
I do n't I wo n't do that

#s52
And I think most of them have agreed to that now although they did n't like it at first

#s56
Yeah

#s57
it is

#s58
I can see where you would think

#s59
Yeah

#s60
that is belittling you know

#s61
I 'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that

#s63
Yeah

#s64
that 's true

#s66
You bet

#s67
Oh gosh they they would really raise a stink if that was to happen

#s70
Right

#s71
yes

#s72
I agree with that

#s73
I I I would n't be opposed to it at all

#s74
it 's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it to- tooth and nail you know

#s76
but uh well Lynn I 've enjoyed talking with you

#s77
I do n't know how long we 're supposed to carry on a conversation do you

#s80
Oh well we 'd better keep talking because I 've not heard it have we

#s82
Have you heard it

#s84
Anyway we both sort of agree on it do n't we about random testing

#s86
Well listen

#s88
Yeah

#s89
yeah

#s91
If you agree uh

#s94
Yeah

#s96
Is that right

#s98
You just do n't think of that happening with teachers

#s100
I really do n't

#s101
when I think of drug testing I 'm thinking of the you know outside of education

#s104
Sure sure

#s105
I know that

#s106
but uh you do n't think of that first hand normally

#s110
Is n't that is n't that mind boggling

#s112
goodness

#s113
it it is it 's mind bog- you know well you know

#s114
I agree with you

#s115
I know teachers are just like everybody else

#s116
same problems the same uh good qualities as anybody else

#s119
Yeah

#s120
yeah

#s122
You you think the benefit would be greater than the

#s126
Uh-huh

#s127
And that was in your children 's high school

#s129
Is n't that amazing

#s132
If it if it 's if it was true there I 'm sure it 's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is

#s134
you know because they represent a pretty good

#s136
No

#s137
certainly not

#s138
certainly not

#s139
they do n't need that example

#s140
but
