#s1
So do you have any recycling programs there

#s3
Uh-huh

#s6
Oh uh-huh

#s7
Yeah

#s8
We 've progressed a little bit farther than that

#s10
Um actually they have uh parts of town

#s11
it may have even spread all over the whole town

#s12
and um they will have these green bins

#s14
and it 's just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump

#s16
And uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin

#s17
and you put your bottles in it and paper and uh you know all those things that

#s18
aluminum

#s19
You know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin

#s21
And uh I guess you can al-

#s22
and a lot of the restaurants they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles

#s25
And uh oh I do n't know

#s26
I guess they 're you know clear bottles

#s28
So um you know a lot of people do have those separated

#s29
And of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos

#s31
Uh and they have those strateg- strategically placed around the city

#s33
And uh they 're they 're actually going to extend it I think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes

#s34
and uh

#s36
Yeah

#s37
things of that nature

#s38
So I guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary

#s43
Oh yeah

#s48
Uh-huh

#s50
Yeah

#s51
Oh really

#s53
Huh

#s56
Yeah

#s57
I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans

#s59
And uh

#s63
Uh-huh

#s64
Yeah

#s65
they 're doing a real good job of uh separating it here

#s66
And of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper

#s68
And uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it

#s69
but they actually have the door to door pickup

#s70
Um and it 's uh I think it started out to be um just kind of a test a pilot project

#s72
And it went over so well that they just extended it

#s73
And it 's almost uh

#s74
I do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not

#s75
It may be

#s76
But uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up

#s78
Yeah

#s80
Let 's see

#s81
Oh and every year of course the phone books um they tell everybody across the city to uh put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins

#s84
Because you know phone books are pretty

#s85
well for a bigger city they 're pretty thick

#s88
And sometimes you might have two or three

#s90
So uh that 's that 's a big savings right there in itself

#s93
Yeah

#s95
huh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s101
Well the thing about newspapers and paper

#s102
recycled paper is actually very expensive

#s104
So when you see something that 's on recycled paper they 've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that

#s105
It 's uh

#s106
they 're not coming out ahead at all

#s107
It 's uh it 's really a cost

#s109
Yeah

#s111
I mean it it sounds good to the public

#s112
but there 's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something

#s113
Now aluminum I do n't know

#s114
They may be coming out ahead

#s115
But I know for a fact that the paper uh on that end they 're not you know

#s117
It 's just good to recycle

#s118
but it 's uh not to their advantage

#s120
And it costs less

#s122
I ca n't think of anything else

#s124
Okay

#s126
Uh-huh

#s128
Well I hope you all um uh come along a little farther in the future

#s131
It was nice talking to you

#s133
Bye-bye
