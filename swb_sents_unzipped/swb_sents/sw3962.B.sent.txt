#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
I I have n't gotten into that too much because I uh if I do n't know the story line and um I do n't speak the language then I have difficult time comprehending what 's going on

#s20
Uh-huh

#s26

#s64
Um a little bit

#s65
but um a lot of the um music I do n't know about uh as far as the titles

#s84
But they also uh they also uh go to the different composers or the different I guess

#s85

A lot of them are

#s97
Or they will kno- find out when they 're performing

#s98
