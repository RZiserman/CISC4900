Um actually I have um I 've I 've been in them but um just visiting

#s8
and uh we used to g-

#s9
when we were like in in our teen ages we 'd go on Sundays and visit you know the older people

#s10
But um I have an elderly grandma that lives with us

#s12
And she 's lived with us for like five years

#s13
So I kind of know how it is to how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home

#s14
or um like we I mean we 've had those discussions you know about should we put her in or because she 's pretty senile

#s15
and

#s19
Yeah

#s20
It 's rea-

#s27
Uh-huh

#s34
Oh really

#s37
Uh-huh

#s40
Right

#s43
To put her in a rest home

#s47
Um well see it 's more my grandma that feels that way

#s49
She says that when her husband died that he said oh that my uncle had said that he would never ha- put her in a rest home

#s50
So it 's kind of uh

#s51
I do n't know

#s52
mean I do n't I do n't think my parents would

#s53
but she is getting pretty bad

#s54
like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed

#s55
it 's

#s57
and my mom has to take care of her pretty much

#s58
so it gets

#s59
I do n't know

#s60
It 's it 's a hard decision

#s61
but I do n't think I would do it to my parents personally

#s70
When he retired

#s75
Yeah

#s76
it 's like that good for us just because my uncle and my and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months

#s78
So that that works out good

#s86
Uh-huh

#s90
Really

#s97
Uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s105
You think

#s106
I I I 'm not really familiar with how other countries

#s110
They 're seen as senile

#s116
Right

#s119
Uh-huh

#s121
Right

#s125
Uh-huh

#s126
I know

#s129
Um I 'm twenty

#s131
Yeah

#s132
it 's it really is

#s134
but and she she drives us craz-
