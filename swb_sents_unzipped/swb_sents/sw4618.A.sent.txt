#s1
Go ahead

#s3
Uh no

#s4
I have n't

#s5
But in my job I 'm a nurse

#s6
and we are allowed to be

#s7
I mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime

#s8
Uh I do n't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested

#s11
They can if they choose to

#s13
Right

#s14
Have you well wai- have you had any experience with it at all

#s18
Uh-huh

#s19
So what do you think about that

#s23
Right

#s24
right

#s25
See I know of that too

#s26
And I also know that things like antihistamines Sudafeds things like that can really throw it off

#s27
And you can not get a job because of it

#s28
and they may not tell you the reason why

#s29
Uh-huh

#s37
See and so it really is a dangerous thing that way

#s38
because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and did n't get the job

#s39
and they were n't told why

#s40
But a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing

#s41
or they would tell you

#s42
Or this person never use any drugs

#s45
Uh you should

#s46
Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something

#s47
I have real mixed feelings about it

#s48
I do n't know

#s51
The accuracy

#s52
I do n't know

#s53
I do n't know

#s54
But I know there are a lot of things that can influence them

#s55
and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time

#s57
And if you could show that

#s58
I I interviewed for a job recently

#s59
and I was taking Entex

#s60
And my doctor gave me a prescription for it

#s62
And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know

#s63
And it did n't come up that I needed to do it

#s64
but this could happen to anybody

#s65
and if they would just say oh this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them you know Then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything

#s68
So I do n't know

#s70
Yeah

#s71
I 'm not sure either

#s73
The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it

#s74
because they say they can spot check

#s76
Yeah

#s78
Well it sort of is

#s79
And this is it

#s80
this

#s81
I 'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways

#s82
You know as a health professional I would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs

#s84
You know so as a patient I feel well yeah we probably should be protected

#s85
But on the other hand there 's a lot of things I should be protected from that they do n't test my patients for too

#s86
So you know I guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way

#s88
You ca n't go around testing everybody for everything

#s90
So I do n't know

#s91
And I I think it could be used to hassle somebody

#s92
If someone was out to get you I think that a company or a boss could use this

#s93
You know they could keep on doing this to you or something I guess

#s94
I can see where it could become a problem

#s98
Really

#s99
Oh wow

#s100
But maybe you should n't be held responsible for something you did several years ago

#s103
That 's the other thing

#s104
I mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on

#s105
and I do n't think they should really have to pay for that forever

#s108
Yeah

#s110
I think that 's true

#s111
Yeah

#s112
yeah

#s113
So that probably would n't be too good either
