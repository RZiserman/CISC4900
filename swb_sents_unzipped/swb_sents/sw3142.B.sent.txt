#s1
Okay

#s2
well I guess I enjoy eating out um uh here and there

#s3
or it 's it 's a good change and a good change from cooking and eating at home

#s4
and I guess I like a variety of a variety of restaurants

#s6
Uh sometimes it 's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal

#s7
and sometimes it 's I enjoy it 's I enjoy going out having a formal meal

#s9
And uh sometimes it 's nice to go out and have a salad

#s11
Something you know

#s13
Well a variety

#s14
I I like to go sometimes without them

#s15
and sometimes I sometimes it 's okay to take them along

#s16
So

#s18
Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches

#s20
so uh it just you know it just varies

#s21
we do a mix

#s22
Sometimes it 's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband

#s23
and it would n't even really matter which restaurant it was

#s24
just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table

#s27
So uh I guess I guess actually on those those times uh we even there are times I even say oh please do n't sit us next to a table with other children

#s29
this is our night out

#s30
So but uh anyway where do you like to eat

#s34
Uh-huh

#s38
Right

#s40
Right

#s42
Oh which one do you like

#s44
Oh okay

#s45
Well it 's been a long time since we 've been in there

#s46
but uh but it 's good

#s47
There 's an Italian restaurant over over by the mall over by uh Plano Parkway there

#s48
pas-

#s50
Oh is it Campari 's or something

#s53
Well it 's good

#s54
I have n't my husband had been in there several times

#s55
and we went in there actually we went in there for lunch one day

#s57
And uh their pastas were great

#s61
You 're brave

#s66
Oh God

#s69
Right

#s72
No

#s73
I do n't think so

#s76
Oh well Even though traditional it can backfire

#s80
Uh well my husband 's kind of the eth- he he 's the ethnic fan

#s81
So he 's

#s82
I do n't know

#s83
You know what

#s84
we read we read the uh D MAGAZINE

#s87
we we check that and uh the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there

#s89
They often do ratings of restaurants

#s90
so

#s92
uh we 've uh we 've usually we often save those and ventured out on from there uh just for something that had a high rating

#s95
Okay

#s97
That 's That 's right

#s103
Oh good

#s104
Oh good

#s106
Oh Oh yeah

#s107
We I guess we we use the coupons too

#s108
That 's true

#s109
That 's true

#s112
Oh right

#s113
Right

#s117
Well I think that it 's just that 's ex-

#s118
sometimes I think going out to eat it 's it 's sort of a recreation

#s120
So uh just a just a change of pace from uh eating at home

#s122
So uh anyway I guess uh as far as as far as service when we go out gosh it 's nice it 's nice to have someone come and wait the table And clear the table and

#s127
Yeah

#s128
and do the dishes

#s129
And uh actually it 's kind of nice to you know

#s130
I always

#s131
uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table it 's nice that they 're attentive

#s132
but it 's not nice when they 're too attentive

#s134
So uh we 've had experience with that too

#s135
So

#s137
Oh yeah

#s138
Well how we

#s140
it may it may help their tip may not huh

#s142
Gosh I guess just in Plano I Plano I like to go to Souper Salads

#s144
Uh Chili 's Chili 's is always fine

#s146
I guess if we go to Dallas into Dallas we like uh the Routh is it Routh Street Cafe

#s148
Well well you would like it

#s151
You 'd like it especially it you 're adventuresome

#s153
It just we 've we 've taken people there several times

#s154
and uh they have a good they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding

#s155
I guess it 's

#s156
whether you call it Southwestern

#s157
but uh oh we had venison venison chili one time Which was absolutely wonderful

#s159
And then I guess it must be seasonal

#s160
and we 've been back

#s161
oh I guess it 's in the winter season

#s162
well they 've never had it when we 've been back

#s164
so But uh well you ought to try that

#s165
It 's it 's it 's very good

#s172
No

#s182
Oh that 's good

#s183
Yes

#s184
