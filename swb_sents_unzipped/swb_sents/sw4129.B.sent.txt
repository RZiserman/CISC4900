I have ambivalent feelings because I do n't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is

#s4
But on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain

#s5
you know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country

#s7
And it 's eating us alive budget wise

#s8
and uh

#s10
Yes

#s11
we do practice capital punishment

#s12
but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it 's a very long haul before anybody 's ever executed

#s15
Yeah

#s16
And then I was reading in the paper just this morning it 's interesting because I had forgotten I guess that I wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody th- than it does to keep them Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know

#s21
Well I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people You know who would see it

#s25
Yeah

#s26
but I 'm not sure how successful that is

#s28
Quicker maybe

#s29
yeah

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
What what kind of work do you do

#s36
Um well see I 'm a school principal

#s38
Elementary school

#s40
And in a very poor section of town with p- predominantly Anglo kids

#s41
And I see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do

#s43
and see I 'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that

#s44
I mean course you could n't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there

#s46
but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids we 'd have fewer decisions to make Down the road you know

#s49
Oh yeah

#s51
Well I 'm not talking about just in the school system

#s54
See I 'm talking about

#s55
like in in

#s56
uh I 'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared

#s57
Uh I know the institutions do n't work that well

#s58
but it 's a bad day because I get all these kids through my office

#s59
I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids

#s61
Five hundred of them are good solid kids

#s62
and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day

#s64
And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible

#s65
Some of them in the penal system

#s67
And you know you just see those kids going down the road

#s68
Now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment

#s69
but some of them have already been in youth centers And that kind of thing

#s71
and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals

#s72
and I 'm not talking about necessarily in the school system

#s73
I 'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action

#s75
I think that 's one reason we have problems in schools uh

#s76
and some of them are our problems

#s77
but a lot of it 's because everything society wants we are supposed to do

#s79
But that 's another subject

#s80
but

#s83
Anyway I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has making a decision what to do with them

#s87
Uh-huh

#s88
I do n't I do n't know that there is an easy solution

#s89
but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and I 'm not sure what it would be It would be money better spent than

#s91
do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard

#s92
That 's true

#s95
Statistically that 's true

#s99
Uh-huh

#s101
Are you for it

#s103
I 'm for it in in some cases

#s105
Yeah

#s108
What kind of crimes would you d- use it for

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
I I would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going You know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children

#s116
Well you know somebody elected that recently

#s119
And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know

#s121
But uh
