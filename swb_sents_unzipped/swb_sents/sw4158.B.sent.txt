#s2
Uh yes

#s3
I am

#s4
I 'm working in the computer science department here uh at C M U

#s7
Uh I 'm doing basically system system design work and uh implementation work for the speech for the speech group uh here

#s12
Yeah

#s14
actually through electronic mail

#s18
Uh-huh

#s27
Right

#s28
So it 's pretty fair they 've got you slaving away at at this point

#s31
Yeah

#s33
Well um t- i- I 'm research stuff here now

#s34
so what they they have uh um okay benefits package

#s35
It 's not quite as good as industry

#s36
but one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um

#s37
and they pay for you know pay for the classes

#s39
So Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit

#s44
Uh-huh

#s47
If you want to do it quickly

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
uh-huh

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Yeah

#s59
So I I do n't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary

#s60
I 'd you know I

#s61
Yeah

#s62
we we do

#s63
We have to contribute a certain amount uh to it

#s65
And it 's kind of split between C M U and and you know the employee

#s72
Right

#s73
Yeah

#s74
and it 's also right now it 's uh the

#s75
like everywhere else uh here in Pittsburgh the health care uh rates are are going up pretty quickly

#s77
That 's a whole other topic to begin with too

#s79
but

#s80
Yeah

#s81
but it 's you are right

#s82
I I I really agree that that that 's pretty important

#s85
Right

#s87
Right

#s88
Uh-huh

#s89
Oh

#s91
Now that 's a big win

#s93
Yeah

#s94
yeah

#s95
That 's

#s97
Yeah

#s99
Yeah

#s100
I figured for

#s101
and they 've just raised the um income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well

#s104
Yeah

#s105
well if you could call it a benefit that C M U I mean i-

#s106
the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies

#s108
Um so that 's that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry

#s111
You know in case you know in case you ever need to bail out

#s115
Uh-huh
