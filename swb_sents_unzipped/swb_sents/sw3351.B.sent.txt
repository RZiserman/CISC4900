#s2
Yes

#s5
Yes

#s6
I have a dog and cat now

#s8
Tibby and Liberty

#s11
Tibby is the dog

#s12
and Liberty is the cat

#s14
Oh

#s18
Oh Ours are pretty calm

#s21
Uh-huh

#s24
Yeah

#s25
Our cat we got from the pound the day bef- the night she was going to be put to sleep

#s26
So that 's why we call her Liberty

#s29
Do you want to hear about my other animals I 've had

#s32
I 've had a skunk

#s34
I 've had a Burmese python

#s35
I 've had rats

#s36
I 've had mice

#s38
uh let 's see

#s39
I 've had gerbils

#s40
I have I had a son he 's now gone from the home that was an animal lover

#s42
So at one point I had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house

#s45
Yes

#s47
it was litter trained

#s49
and we had it perfumed

#s51
and uh it was very aggressive

#s53
But all the all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house

#s56
And the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa

#s59
Nobody came near it when he was there

#s63
Oh

#s65
Yeah

#s66
they um ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them

#s67
but the glands had been removed

#s69
so

#s72
Right

#s73
One other question we had is Why do you have pets

#s82
Yeah

#s83
I always said if I di- Well I always said if I died I 'd come back as a dog

#s87
That 'd be the best way to be

#s90
Well we had a German Shepherd

#s91
and he had dysplasia

#s93
and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went

#s95
So when he died we got a little one

#s97
But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old

#s98
and it just you know was almost cruel because

#s101
Yeah

#s102
he just he could n't get up

#s103
he could n't walk

#s104
so he was a hundred and twenty pounds

#s105
so it was a chore

#s107
So we said the next time around we 'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry

#s110
And then we 've had three cats in our married life

#s111
and we 've got a calico now

#s114
Do you

#s123
Um

#s126
Yeah

#s127
well do n't even talk to me

#s128
I when I was single I had gone away for the weekend

#s130
and my husband then fianc3e was to keep my cat

#s131
and he let her out

#s132
and my house was loaded with fleas

#s133
I mean you walked in

#s134
and your legs were just black

#s136
And we had such a time and never got the cat back

#s138
Yeah

#s139
I found it you know in the street

#s141
I was a social worker at the time and found it
