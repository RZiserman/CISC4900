So um how do you feel about the crime in your city

#s2
Is it uh

#s5
Uh-huh

#s9
Oh really

#s11
Uh-huh

#s14
Oh yeah

#s16
San Jose California

#s19
Here you know the real problems are the gangs

#s21
A lot of gang related a lot of murders

#s22
uh just in general the whole

#s23
we 've only been here a couple of years

#s24
Uh before that we lived in Colorado

#s25
but in comparison to Colorado it 's real noticeable

#s28
I mean you can just feel I mean I can just sense

#s29
I mean I wo n't even I wo n't go to the grocery store at night

#s33
You know

#s34
And it it 's that kind of thing

#s35
and uh

#s37
Yeah

#s38
We have a neighborhood watch program in the house uh the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce uh home theft burglary and things of that sort

#s40
Do you have that where you live

#s41
or

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Oh no

#s50
Uh-huh

#s53
Uh-huh

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Well you know uh also I 've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they 're home Like on the weekends

#s60
A high percentage of uh free time

#s61
I think it 's like fifty percent of most people 's free time is uh spent doing yard work outdoors

#s63
So they wait while you 're out outdoors

#s64
They know the house is unlocked

#s65
and then they just slip in

#s66
Slip in slip out you know

#s68
They know exactly what they 're going for

#s70
So I 've heard that 's really on the rise as far as uh you know a new type of crime

#s74
Yeah

#s76
Unfortunately yes

#s79
Uh-huh

#s80
Yeah

#s82
Uh-huh

#s85
Uh-huh

#s88
I mean

#s92
Yeah

#s93
it helps to know your neighbors you know

#s94
They give you

#s95
you 're supposed to make lists of uh cars

#s96
Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development

#s97
If I see a car that 's unfamiliar we we have a list

#s98
is that what you you did in your program Where you have a list of license plates

#s100
Yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s106
Oh uh-huh

#s108
Yeah

#s109
Well

#s113
Uh-huh

#s114
I mean you you hate to be paranoid

#s115
but there are really only so many things you can do

#s116
You can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program you know uh as a woman not go out at night

#s119
uh you can do that which is what I choose to do

#s122
Yeah

#s124
Uh-huh

#s128
Uh-huh

#s129
That 's

#s130
Uh-huh

#s132
But it 's not uh

#s133
if you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home it 's considered self-defense though

#s135
It is n't

#s138
Uh-huh

#s140
Uh-huh

#s141
Huh

#s147
Really

#s150
Yeah

#s152
Yeah

#s153
Well I think if if you had ha- a handgun though in other words it was n't premeditated you had a handgun it 's the middle of the night someone 's down-
