Do you work with do you work around children when you work

#s8
With computers

#s11
Okay

#s12
do you ha-

#s14
but you have friends that have children

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
What is child care like in New York

#s20
What is

#s24
Does the company you work for have child care on premises for employees

#s32
Oh

#s33
Oh my

#s35
A sabbatical

#s37
Well I hope you can stay as long as possible with it

#s42
Oh yeah

#s43
that would be wonderful

#s44
Right

#s47
Right

#s50
Right

#s53
I think it does when when they are real little

#s54
and they are changing every day

#s56
there 's

#s57
and you just miss the little things

#s59
and and uh

#s61
Uh-huh

#s62
Uh-huh

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
That 's right

#s68
That 's right

#s70
That 's right

#s72
Right

#s75
Right

#s76
Well that it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother

#s79
Right

#s81
Our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a a Montessori day care system

#s83
And they took infants starting at six weeks

#s84
and they have a program uh in that was devised by this montessori person

#s85
and uh and a certain type of stimulations

#s86
and there 's times of day that even when the child is awake that they that they lay quietly and look at certain things

#s87
they keep deliberately keep the room not real bright

#s89
And and uh they have different things they will they will put them down on the floor

#s90
and of course they never have more than like five

#s91
and and they will put them down on the floor

#s92
and they will have on- I think one of them was a little mirror

#s93
and some were just different objects that have had a definite purpose for kids you know

#s95
and there 's something about their eyes

#s97
Uh

#s99
How old is she

#s101
Oh yeah

#s103
Uh-huh

#s105
Uh-huh

#s106
uh-huh

#s108
Uh-huh

#s111
Um

#s112
little older

#s115
It is because that 's when they are clinging to mama

#s117
so you might have a real problem with that

#s118
I think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying

#s120
so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place

#s123
But that 's unusual

#s125
Uh-huh

#s126
Is it your parents or your husband 's parents

#s132
Oh

#s135
Right

#s136
right

#s137
That 's nice when uh

#s138
I my I have three grandchildren

#s139
another one coming in September

#s140
and I

#s141
it would if they were where I could not get my hands on them I am afraid I would probably go crazy

#s143
You know I I like that

#s145
but if it you do not have to put them in child care that 's that 's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them as

#s146
or you can set up your work program and your husband 's so that one of you is there all the time

#s148
That 's that 's wonderful for the child

#s149
But

#s151
Right

#s152
And you need to look at when you if you do decide to go with child care you really need to to look at what your options are and and look at the what they offer

#s153
drop in at times that are unexpected

#s156
The

#s158
Uh

#s159
Uh

#s163
Uh-huh

#s168
Oh

#s171
Oh that would be wonderful

#s172
And

#s173
Uh-huh

#s174
uh-huh

#s176
Uh-huh

#s179
Oh

#s182
Right

#s183
Right

#s184
Right

#s185
Uh-huh

#s188
Uh-huh

#s191
I do too

#s194
Really well trained people

#s195
Right

#s196
Yeah

#s197
and have have some kind of real good program set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if there 's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid

#s198
Yeah

#s199
or and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner And have the you know the right toys and the right setting and uh have a an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule you know

#s200
Oh yeah

#s201
that 's real important to little kids

#s206
Uh-huh

#s207
But

#s208
They they adjust to what the parents MUMBLEx

#s212
Uh-huh

#s213
We- you know that works until they start school

#s215
And that 's a problem

#s216
society is geared to a a day person

#s217
and it 's

#s218
I have another friend whose brother and his wife have done this

#s219
they stay up until all hours of the night
