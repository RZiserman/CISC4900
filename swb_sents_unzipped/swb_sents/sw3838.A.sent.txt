Okay

#s4
Oh well actually I 'm from California

#s5
and before then I was from Utah

#s6
So

#s8
Well I grew up in California

#s9
and then I went to school in Utah

#s10
and I got married there

#s11
and we stayed there for a while

#s12
and then now we 're in U- Iowa

#s14
Oh really

#s16
Oh

#s21
Um

#s22
Well I crochet

#s23
and I do water color

#s24
and I um sew

#s25
and I do fabric painting

#s28
Um I 've done some cross stitching

#s29
I have n't tried any needlepoint yet

#s30
How about you

#s32
Oh right

#s37
Oh really

#s39
Uh-huh

#s40
Oh gosh

#s41
Oh yeah

#s42
well those take a lot of time

#s44
I only can do things that are pretty fast because we just um got our baby last year

#s45
and I just do n't have the patience to just you know do something

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Um I crocheted an afghan for our bed

#s50
That 's the only thing

#s51
and and I did a quilt

#s52
let 's see

#s53
I 've done a quilt for our baby

#s54
and I 've done a quilt for our bed

#s55
but I mean

#s58
Um

#s59
Um our baby 's quilt it was a pre like the design

#s60
I just went around the design in the quilt

#s62
I did n't piece it or anything like that

#s63
but uh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s66
and

#s70
Um I put it on the frame the quilting frame

#s71
Have you are you familiar with that

#s73
Yeah

#s74
okay

#s78
Oh my God

#s84
Well I have n't done tons of them

#s85
But um I used to do more before um before I had before we got our baby

#s86
but

#s89
Uh-huh

#s93
Yes

#s94
exactly

#s96
Well one thing that I like about this fabric painting thing is I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with Heat and Bond or whatever and then paint around it

#s97
And I usually sew sew around the flower whatever first

#s98
and then I paint around it

#s99
so you ca n't see the stitching as much

#s100
Does does that make sense to you

#s101
So

#s107
Oh

#s111
Oh sure

#s112
Uh-huh

#s113
Oh really

#s116
Oh

#s123
Well

#s124
Yeah

#s125
someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways

#s126
and I 've always after hearing that I always sewed it on

#s127
even even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps

#s128
And um
