#s2
Oh I I start

#s3
Okay

#s4
Well uh we keep a budget to an extent

#s5
Uh and really i- i- we were really forced into keeping a budget because I 'm I 'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh uh restrictions

#s6
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid

#s7
Uh about yourself

#s13
Yeah

#s14
Well I guess that really is sort of uh keeping a budget you know

#s15
You stay within your uh within your means

#s19
Yeah

#s21
Yes

#s23
Oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco

#s26
That is a hugh difference

#s27
Yeah

#s30
But you have good sour dough

#s31
and it 's a beautiful place to live

#s33
It 's God 's country

#s44
Yeah

#s47
Well that that 's a system too

#s51
Well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips

#s52
And you do obviously have enough to live on

#s53
so I guess you 're indirectly budgeting Uh just bye-bye the fact that you said you 're both very frugal uh in spending the money

#s54
Uh-huh

#s55
So I mean that 's that 's a form of budgeting I would think

#s56
It 's it 's kind of a strange topic to to try to for two people who do n't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money

#s58
Yeah

#s60
Uh well we 're we have one on the way

#s62
Uh my wife

#s63
and then we 're we 're having one on the way in uh in uh September

#s66
No

#s67
I think it 's just going to be one

#s69
How about yourself

#s74
Do they budget at all

#s75
I mean do you have them on an allowance

#s81
Yeah

#s84
Yeah
