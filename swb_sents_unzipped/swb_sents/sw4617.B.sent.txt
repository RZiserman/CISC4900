#s2
I say they uh

#s3
probably the best things to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water

#s4
if they sink they 're innocent right

#s7
Yeah

#s8
Uh so uh how do you how do you feel

#s9
Th- that 's of course being facetious

#s10
but

#s15
Uh-huh

#s18
Uh-huh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s22
And I guess also what the system will absorb

#s24
Probably more tuned in to that

#s25
Possibly though on uh capital cases like maybe the death penalty

#s27
uh I 'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole

#s28
I mean he could have like a personal prejudice

#s29
You know judges are people like everybody else even though they 're they 're supposed to be impartial

#s31
but maybe uh

#s35
I I think that 's I think that 's the way it is

#s37
Uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh the accused or whatever would get the uh get the death penalty

#s38
Do they have a death penalty in California

#s41
Yeah

#s42
Uh-huh

#s45
Yeah

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Yeah

#s50
I

#s51
something like that I 've got no problem with it

#s52
Uh

#s54
I guess the way I think about it is not it should n't necessarily be thought of as revenge

#s55
It 's just like if you 've got like a dog that 's running wild and biting people

#s57
put it to sleep you know

#s58
Just get it out you know

#s59
it 's not able to fit in you know

#s61
Yeah

#s62
Yeah

#s63
exactly

#s64
Uh I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just

#s65
if somebody gets the death penalty they 're they 're judged guilty

#s66
they got the death penalty

#s67
they should have one year and one appeal Cover all their bases with one appeal

#s68
and if not you know do n't do n't let them sit up there on death row for you know fifteen years

#s71
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s73
that

#s76
Yeah

#s77
Oh I 'm sure

#s78
Yeah

#s80
Uh-huh

#s84
I believe it is in capital

#s85
I think in like uh lesser cases it 's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever How ever many is on sitting on a jury

#s87
I t- I believe that 's the way it is

#s88
But I 'm pretty sure you 're correct on capital cases

#s89
Uh

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Yeah

#s96
Oh no

#s98
I 'm telling you go one way or the other

#s99
That that 's probably an expensive trial

#s100
Uh

#s103
Yeah

#s104
Probably

#s106
Yeah

#s107
Probably

#s108
You know I 'm not sure there 's a number

#s109
It 's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know worth of all the free for all

#s111
Yeah

#s112
Yeah

#s113
that 's that 's been so long I 've prac- practically forgot who Noriega was you know

#s115
That has been going on

#s116
My uh cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami

#s118
Yeah

#s119
So she follows that stuff pretty closely

#s120
But uh

#s122
Yeah

#s123
she 's not involved in that that case

#s124
But she does

#s126
No

#s127
I have n't

#s128
I never have

#s129
My wife has

#s130
but I I have n't

#s134
Uh-huh

#s136
Uh-huh

#s138
Uh-huh
