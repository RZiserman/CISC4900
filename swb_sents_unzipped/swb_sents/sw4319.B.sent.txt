#s3
Uh pretty good actually

#s4
I work for Hewlett Packard

#s5
and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package

#s6
In fact they 're they 're kind of known uh for having good benefits

#s7
The pay is n't fabulous

#s8
although I saw a survey recently

#s9
and I 'm actually making just about as much as you know I 'm m- making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me

#s13
I 've got a Bachelor 's in electrical engineering

#s14
so

#s16
And I 'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff

#s18
Uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good

#s19
We 've got stock purchase program and a

#s20
that that 's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain

#s22
but uh there 's a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income

#s25
Uh there 's

#s27
I 've been with them for seven years

#s29
Yeah

#s31
And the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it 's pretty soon you 're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything

#s33
so uh it 's not t-

#s34
but there 's full uh th- there 's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything

#s35
I do n't get sick that often

#s36
so I do n't pay much of it

#s37
b- and I pay five dollars every time I visit the the hospital that you know for a checkup or whatever

#s40
Uh they do n't cover eyes though

#s41
and I I have contact lenses

#s42
so that 's kind of a pain

#s44
But you know I I can live

#s46
Oh yeah

#s47
yeah

#s49
Right

#s51
And

#s53
Yeah

#s54
yeah

#s55
and and the dental plan is fabulous

#s56
The dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because uh

#s58
I I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that

#s60
but that 's not the case

#s62
so I guess nothing

#s63
It 's fabulous

#s65
Uh the

#s66
what about you

#s70
Uh-huh

#s74
Uh

#s76
Uh-huh

#s78
Uh-huh

#s81
Yeah

#s83
Uh-huh

#s94
Yeah

#s98
Yeah

#s99
one of the things with my company is that they 've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security

#s100
and uh there 's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do

#s102
so there 's

#s103
I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company

#s105
and it 's and I and I have n't had to move my residence to do that

#s106
You know I still live in San Jose

#s107
and

#s110
Yeah

#s111
it

#s114
Oh yeah

#s115
Yeah

#s117
Uh-huh

#s120
Right

#s121
right

#s124
Uh-huh

#s127
Yeah

#s128
yeah

#s130
In fact I know a guy who works at Andover who used to work who I used to work with out here

#s132
and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position

#s133
Kind of interesting

#s134
Uh a- anyhow
