#s4
No

#s5
I do n't use a family budget

#s6
my father who is very old has kept one his entire life

#s8
and I probably re- rebelled against it

#s9
I probably should have kept one

#s10
He keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage

#s18
Right

#s20
I think it makes much more sense

#s22
and I have recently uh gotten out of debt and everything

#s23
and I will probably ke- start keeping a little better track of it

#s26
I just uh spent whatever came in and and uh didn- never knew what came in and what went out But uh just you know like about like the government runs

#s29
Huh

#s31
So I think it is probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record

#s32
but my dad was so precise that I mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that 's what it was spent

#s34
And that was put over there

#s37
and I mean of course he is from the depression

#s38
and uh so uh you know it 's his life

#s41
but uh I would I think it would be smart if somebody would keep uh some sort of a plan that works for them

#s48
Yeah

#s49
it is

#s51
I 'm a historian

#s52
and my father had kept them I think since nineteen twenty-seven

#s53
and uh but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-

#s55
I could not believe he did that

#s56
but then so I took the ones from fifty-two on to the present

#s59
but to look to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that

#s61
But uh

#s64
Uh-huh

#s69
Oh

#s71
I know

#s72
Right

#s76
I know

#s77
well even in nineteen sixty-three

#s78
I found a record that I had I travel in Europe a lot and I what I had paid for hotels

#s80
And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now

#s82
And I paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty

#s84
And that 's really crazy

#s85
cause that 's about thirty years ago

#s88
Oh But of course it 's just what the market will bear

#s90
If people will pay two hundred then why charge ten

#s92
You know MUMBLEx

#s95
Right

#s96
right

#s100
Uh-huh

#s103
Uh-huh

#s104
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s106
Well then you never know how they will

#s107
one

#s108
they may flip flop when they get to be uh ol- we- older

#s112
The other one may be very careful

#s114
and she may marry somebody

#s115
and of course it would be good because it you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching uh

#s117
You should have one in the in the in the house

#s121
And I think

#s126
Yeah

#s129
Yeah

#s130
that 's about the way it is here

#s132
if it had not been for my wife I would have probably been in debtor 's prison if we had one

#s134
So but what does you husband do now

#s137
Oh

#s139
Um

#s140
Oh yeah

#s141
You have to do it when you are in school

#s145
My wife is still in school getting her doctorate

#s147
and it uh

#s149
and I have got

#s155
Um

#s157
Oh I I know

#s158
We had three in college plus my wife

#s160
so that was four

#s162
So we were both in the same

#s166
Yeah

#s167
Yeah

#s171
That is the best one

#s173
Yeah

#s174
with education you ca n't take that away from you

#s179
Right

#s180
Sure

#s182
Yeah

#s183
