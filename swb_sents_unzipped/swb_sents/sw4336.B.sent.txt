Atlanta is kind of high

#s5
Uh it 's it 's lower than it has been in the past

#s6
Uh I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off

#s7
and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher

#s11
Yeah

#s12
Uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into

#s13
Any specifics

#s18
Um

#s20
Right

#s21
well I guess here we run into that sometime

#s22
but I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins

#s24
There are some but not not very high

#s25
Uh as far as tellers and things like that it 's not extremely high either

#s26
There were one case where uh this one guy uh was taking women from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all

#s28
so so that 's kind of like a double assault there

#s31
Really

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
Oh wow

#s37
Yeah

#s38
there 's a crime

#s43
Uh-huh

#s46
Oh okay

#s47
I do n't know

#s48
crime situations here they

#s49
like I say lot of lot of cases is usually just apartments and and break ins and things like that

#s50
and a lot of it is due to drugs Uh drug related you know in in most cases

#s52
it 's not like uh it 's someone do steal a a or television or V C R or something like that

#s53
it is for drugs you know because you really ca n't on the street make any money off of it per se you know

#s54
you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it

#s56
so you really not making a sizeable profit

#s57
So it 's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist

#s61
Right

#s63
Yeah

#s64
Uh-huh

#s66
Uh-huh

#s69
Uh-huh

#s71
Yeah

#s72
that 's true

#s73
but you 'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not uh participating in any type crime

#s74
I guess there was one case

#s75
I was surprised uh

#s76
so happened this person worked at the same place

#s77
I work for Georgia Tech

#s78
and they work at the same place I did

#s79
but I did n't know that they had been watching me

#s80
because I was getting ready to to go in my car one morning

#s81
and the first thing they said is uh you must do n't have to be to work at eight you know

#s82
like shock
