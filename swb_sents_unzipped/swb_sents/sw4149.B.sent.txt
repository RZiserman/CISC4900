#s2
Right

#s5
Right now I 'm in college

#s6
and I 'm on work study

#s8
and so my budget comes from my dad 's help

#s10
He helps me out a lot

#s11
and I get paid monthly

#s12
so that 's kind of hard to have a budget

#s13
My mother uh does n't get paid much money

#s14
so her budget is uh just uh planning for I R A 's

#s23
Uh-huh

#s27
Oh

#s30
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s37
That sounds good

#s39
Right

#s40
Right

#s46
Well that 's good

#s51
Well good

#s53
With two kids that could be hard

#s55
Four

#s61
Oh my goodness

#s63
Four boys

#s65
Oh my goodne-

#s67
It 's just me and my sister

#s69
And my parents divorced three years ago

#s71
and my sister had gotten through college

#s72
but I was still in high school

#s73
and my mother paid for a lot of my sister 's college while my parents were together

#s75
and then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college

#s77
But uh when we had the divorce she just did n't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house

#s79
So now my dad 's paying for all of my college of

#s82
And financial aid and scholarships

#s84
I 'm a music major

#s85
so I have auditions coming up

#s88
I 'm a sophomore

#s91
Right

#s92
right

#s93
I 'll I 'll probably have about two two and a half years left

#s99
Oh it sure is

#s100
I I know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks

#s102
and I and I do n't spend over that

#s106
Oh sure

#s107
there 's there 's always music books to buy

#s112
Oh no

#s113
no

#s114
no

#s116
I do n't plan on being a starving artist

#s118
That 's why I 'm in college

#s120
Right

#s125
That 's usually because they 're not real educated

#s126
They ca n't afford to have a really good job

#s128
The starving ones

#s131
There 's enough out there that if you have if you 're educated enough then you can make money

#s136
Right

#s137
What did you major in

#s139
Well good

#s140
you know plenty about planning a b- a budget
