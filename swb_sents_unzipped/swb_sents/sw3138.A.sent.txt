#s3
Alright

#s5
Sometimes not all the time

#s8
Right

#s10
Yeah

#s11
that that 's about the same boat I 'm in too

#s13
Yeah

#s15
Uh five

#s20
Oh well I 'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too

#s21
So

#s23
And they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have

#s28
Huh

#s31
Oh yeah

#s32
well see I m- my oldest is nine

#s33
and he already he already does that

#s36
And I told him he 's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat

#s41
Um

#s42
My husband and I our favorite meal is uh

#s43
and we do it like for special stuff celebrations

#s44
and we have like steak

#s46
and he does the steak

#s47
and then uh

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
And he marinates it in his special stuff that he does

#s53
And it 's real good

#s55
And uh I do sauteed mushrooms

#s57
so

#s59
and asparagus

#s60
And that 's our favorite dinner

#s64
Yeah

#s65
so do we

#s71
Yeah

#s76
Uh-huh

#s79
It 's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it

#s83
I do n't know what that

#s85
I do n't see how you eat that

#s86
but

#s94
Oh

#s97
Yeah

#s99
So it

#s100
Yeah

#s101
it defeats the purpose

#s106
Oh yeah

#s108
Yeah

#s109
My husband makes those

#s111
I 'm not I do n't eat enchiladas

#s113
I I do n't like enchila- I do n't like the tex-

#s114
I do n't know

#s115
I guess it 's the texture or something

#s116
I do n't like the taste of enchiladas

#s118
But everyone else in my family does

#s121
Yeah

#s123
I do n't know

#s124
I it 's I do n't know what

#s125
I do n't know

#s126
I I do n't know what it is about the enchiladas

#s127
I just

#s128
and I 'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother

#s129
I 'm the only one that does n't eat it

#s132
But my kids love it

#s138
Uh-huh

#s139
Yeah

#s140
Yeah

#s141
Yeah

#s142
I 've got a chicken casserole that 's like that that that I 've

#s145
Yeah

#s146
because I when I make this chicken casserole I it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze

#s148
So or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we 're not going to eat

#s150
It 's jus-

#s151
you can use chicken or turkey

#s152
because my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey

#s156
And it 's rice and MUMBLEx

#s157
when I do recipes I just throw stuff in

#s158
I do n't I 'm not real good about measuring

#s160
because I just

#s161
I do it to taste

#s164
And

#s166
Well yeah

#s167
but it it 's like it 's just chicken

#s168
it it 's as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery

#s172
and that 's it

#s173
and some hard-boiled eggs

#s176
And that 's it

#s177
You just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through

#s179
And you sprinkle uh that those uh toasted onion rings On top of it for the crunchy

#s183
And that 's it you know

#s185
And it it it goes

#s187
and it 's filling because of the rice

#s189
So

#s191
Uh-huh

#s193
Yeah

#s195
Yeah

#s196
it gives it a an extra yeah little tang

#s198
Yeah

#s199
that cholesterol fat free

#s202
Uh-huh

#s203
Uh-huh

#s205
I know

#s210
I do n't like tuna salad unless it 's got lots of mayonnaise in it

#s214
Yeah

#s216
I know

#s220
Yeah

#s221
we did the low-cal stuff

#s222
Well with my kids I do n't

#s223
they get enough sugar and stuff anyway

#s224
Mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway

#s226
And they do n't need any added help

#s228
So when we 're here at home you know with sweets and stuff they they do n't we do n't really do that much

#s229
I do a lot of fruits instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that

#s232
And and drink wise they have Kool-Aid milk or water Normally

#s234
Now when they go to their grandmother 's house which is every weekend It 's a it 's a different a different story all around

#s236
