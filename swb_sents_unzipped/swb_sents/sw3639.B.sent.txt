#s2
Well as a matter of fact I just bought one

#s4
Just just within the last three weeks

#s7
I got a Lexus L S four hundred Which is made by Toyota

#s12
Yeah

#s14
It 's kind of their

#s17
Right

#s18
it it sounds like it

#s19
but it really is n't

#s21
It 's uh marketed of course it its own dealerships

#s23
Usually

#s24
or somebody that 's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership uh

#s26
sometimes they do that

#s27
but it 's uh a brand car

#s29
but I 've really liked it

#s30
It it drives just wonderfully

#s31
and there is

#s32
it 's so quiet

#s33
almost ca n't tell the engine is running

#s36
It really is

#s37
It 's got pretty good acceleration too

#s39
It 's got a C D player in it

#s40
so I can I can play those

#s41
and

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
But there is not very many options on that car

#s48
There is only about five or six options

#s49
Everything else is standard

#s52
Uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north The C D and the premium sound system

#s56
Yeah

#s57
it 's kind of a traction control I think they call it

#s59
It 's it 's not just antilock brake

#s60
I think that 's already on most of them

#s61
but there is a further traction control uh

#s64
Yeah

#s65
And and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow

#s66
It can raise the car 's center up a little bit For going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere

#s71
Mississippi probably does n't Mississippi probably does n't have to worry too much

#s75
If it does people go what 's this stuff

#s79
Oh

#s80
well you had some there

#s81
Yeah

#s85
Oh I know

#s90
Oh no

#s91
Well the uh the Lexus uh really

#s92
and the moon roof I think is also an option

#s94
Although most of them are ordered them with it

#s95
but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things

#s96
and everything else is pretty standard

#s98
I did not get the traction control which also when you take the c- traction control and the and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too

#s101
You go out and get in that real cold car

#s103
and you turn that on

#s104
and it yeah and it kind of uh

#s105
but that 's only available if with the traction control and the other option

#s107
And those two are sold together

#s108
so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to to uh do it

#s110
so I I opted not for that but

#s111
And uh the dealership I dealt with they order them all with the uh moon roof and uh you know nice floor mats and everything in there

#s117
So the only thing I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in the stereo system

#s118
and that was pretty much it

#s119
And they had like three or four basic packages that they they offer

#s124
Yeah

#s125
I 've been o-

#s126
I 've been

#s129
Yeah

#s130
I 've seen that in the dealership

#s131
I was driving a Lincoln a Mark Seven for the last four years before I traded it for this

#s133
and uh I 'm leasing the Lexus

#s134
I usually lease them since I own a business

#s136
I just run it through my business

#s137
but but it

#s139
the Lincoln ride is certainly good too

#s140
but the this Lexus is nothing like I have ever been in before

#s141
It 's just

#s143
Yeah

#s144
it really is

#s145
and it 's got a lumbar support in the seats

#s147
Adjustable uh power

#s149
and just kind of brings that support up in the sma-
