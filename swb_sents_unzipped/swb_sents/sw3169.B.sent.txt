Uh about the only memories that I have of boating uh

#s37
my husband 's family had a a motor boat uh when we got engaged

#s38
and they took us out on the lake several times

#s39
And uh I really did enjoy that

#s40
I I do n't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything

#s41
but uh we did some water skiing of course and and uh driving around the lake in the boat

#s42
and and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting Uh you know

#s43
they they just did n't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever

#s44
The the laws were there

#s45
and if you did n't obey them uh you know there were a lot of accidents I guess

#s48
But uh I found the motor boating was real fun

#s58
Oh

#s86
That sounds like a real challenge

#s94
Uh-huh

#s97
Well my son
