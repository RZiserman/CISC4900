#s1
So how you like New Jersey

#s5
Right

#s6
I guess uh I do n't know what part of New Jersey you 're in but I guess it 's uh fairly industrial

#s10
Right uh-huh

#s13
Yeah

#s14
Yeah

#s15
Right

#s20
Right

#s22
Well I do n't know about you

#s23
but I 've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor

#s24
I mean there 's a lot of contributors

#s25
but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that

#s28
Yeah

#s32
That 's yeah that 's that 's

#s33
a big issue is you know a lot of states do n't have a uh inspection law

#s34
so you get you get a lot of people out there without E T R emission control systems on their cars and things like that

#s36
Yeah

#s40
Sure

#s42
Right

#s43
I guess from what I hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars

#s44
They 're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California

#s48
Yeah

#s50
Right

#s51
I hope I I 'm hoping that comes along quick

#s52
Uh I was reading a an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that 's going

#s53
and I guess it 's it 's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize

#s54
and I know that 's not due to uh it 's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the C F C -s

#s55
but

#s57
Uh yeah

#s58
I think that 's a that 's a contributor definitely

#s60
Right

#s61
Right

#s62
Yeah

#s63
I guess right now what they 're what they 're primarily worried about is third world countries because I guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production

#s64
but it

#s66
go ahead

#s74
Right

#s75
And that 's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they do n't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense

#s76
Uh in terms of

#s78
Exactly

#s79
Exactly

#s80
Uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments

#s81
but uh I do n't know

#s82
that 's that 's kind of an interesting situation there

#s83
Uh what they do n't realize those third world countries what they do n't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting

#s84
I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles

#s85
and it 's it 's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places

#s87
So it 's kind of an interesting situation

#s88
It 's not not a real good one actually

#s90
But

#s92
Yeah

#s93
Uh-huh

#s94
yeah

#s95
Yeah

#s96
you do n't get that that source of cleansing anymore

#s97
Are have you been in big cities a long time

#s100
Okay

#s101
so you 've got

#s103
Yeah

#s104
those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard I would think

#s106
Yeah

#s107
Denver 's definitely

#s108
yeah

#s109
that 's one of the worst

#s110
Sure

#s111
Yeah

#s112
Denver 's that that real good e- that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does I guess

#s114
Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the in the world for that

#s116
But I 've been pretty lucky

#s117
I 've lived in cities that really have n't had that much of a problem although uh I 'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida

#s118
and there you can tell that it 's getting worse

#s119
I mean it it definitely it 's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver

#s120
but you can

#s124
Yeah

#s125
And there 's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there

#s127
There is

#s128
but it 's kind of it 's
