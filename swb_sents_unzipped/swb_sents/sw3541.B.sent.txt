#s3
Uh never

#s4
Uh the only thing I 'm I 'm thankful of is that we do n't have to pay any income tax in in Texas

#s6
Yeah

#s7
Boy I tell you what

#s8
I sure hope they do n't pass something like that

#s15
Well I I tell you um

#s16
I remember every time it seems like we turned around they 're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline

#s19
And actually that one the the the taxes on gasoline do n't do n't bug me as much as uh uh what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax

#s22
And every time you go to buy anything now uh

#s23
even you know they they tax food

#s24
That 's the one that really kind of bothers me

#s31
Oh I got you

#s32
because people that uh do n't make very much money wind up spending it all

#s35
Yeah

#s36
whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on

#s42
Wha- what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten thou- or thirty thousand dollars

#s47
Oh sure

#s52
No

#s53
uh no

#s54
I have n't

#s55
but it it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax uh on top of it

#s56
And there 's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand

#s65
Yeah

#s68
Right

#s69
Right

#s72
Sure

#s77
Well what what about the taxes on cigarettes
