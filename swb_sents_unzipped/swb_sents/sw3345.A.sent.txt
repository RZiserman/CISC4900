#s1
Well you keep up with current events

#s4
somewhat

#s7
Is that right

#s9
Yeah

#s10
where whereabouts in Pennsylvania

#s12
Where in Pennsylvania

#s15
Oh do you

#s16
well great

#s18
How 's uh

#s19
well no

#s20
we 're not supposed to talk about that

#s21
We 're supposed to talk about current events

#s24
Well I 'm a current event junkie

#s25
So I I watch I try to watch the news

#s26
and I read the newspaper

#s27
and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what 's going on in the world

#s29
MUMBLEx

#s31
Well I just pretty uh

#s32
little you know about everything

#s33
And not and then again not everything

#s35
but you know I like to know pretty well what 's happening

#s36
Political things do n't interest me a great deal except I do like to stay informed enough to feel like I halfway vote intelligently you know

#s38
but uh other than that uh I just you know

#s39
just the events that happen around the world interest me

#s40
Stay in touch with it and know feel like I know what 's going on

#s42
Now I have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events

#s44
But I always have been

#s46
and I stay up with it

#s47
But uh how do you how do you uh stay aware of most of the current events

#s48
Uh newspaper T V news or what

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Right

#s55
Yeah

#s56
that 's good

#s58
Well you stay up with it pretty well then

#s61
Uh-huh

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
yes

#s66
uh-huh

#s67
Oh you 've been there

#s69
well you would be interested in it then

#s72
Yeah uh

#s73
I follow it you know

#s74
I do n't just read everything about it

#s75
but I 'm always aware of what 's going on like that

#s77
and uh because it is it 's interesting

#s79
and uh I do n't know

#s80
I feel sorry for those people down there

#s81
they 've just been so terribly mistreated for so many many years you know I mean through Papa Doc

#s84
I mean he was a terrible tyrant

#s87
and I think it 's been better since he died

#s88
but it 's still been bad

#s90
but uh even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh

#s91
I 've read some things about him that he was he was n't too good himself

#s93
Yeah

#s94
he was pretty pretty much a

#s95
he did n't mind having people bumped off for certain things you know

#s97
But uh It 's one of the reasons the U S was n't so you know did n't do more than they did at the time because they were n't all that excited about him although he 's probably better than a lot of them

#s100
but uh but then again who you know

#s101
those people are so used to it

#s102
I guess it 's the only thing that works

#s105
I think it 's pretty darned good

#s106
I think we 're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have

#s108
I really do

#s109
Now I they sometimes they jump on it and and and go a little to the extreme

#s110
the media does

#s111
but uh but that 's kind of understandable because you know of course if you watch it more more than once a day I mean it 's the same thing over and over and over and over

#s112
and I listen to the radio

#s115
so I you hear so much

#s116
you get a little tired of it

#s117
but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe

#s119
but I think the quality of our uh our news is just uh

#s120
I do n't believe it could be better

#s122
I really do n't

#s126
I do n't think so

#s127
I do n't think our news could be better

#s129
I I mean I mean what else could they do to make it better

#s131
I do n't see anything that they could do

#s135
Well you always want to think everything can be improved upon

#s138
I understand what you 're saying

#s141
But by trial and error over the years I think they got it about as good as they 're going to get it

#s144
Uh nothing is perfect

#s146
Uh-huh

#s147
Well that 's true

#s148
I understand what you 're saying

#s149
and then again I understand why they ca n't dig too much deeper

#s150
that 's why we have C N N

#s152
C N N has the time since that 's all they do is news to dig deeper
