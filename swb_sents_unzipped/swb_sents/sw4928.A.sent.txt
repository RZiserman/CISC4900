#s1
Well my exercise program consists of uh you know

#s2
it 's it 's a opportunity to stay alive really Instead of you know wasting my my you know the trying to exist on the latency of my youth the good health of my youth

#s4
I 'm

#s5
and what I like to do is I like to stretch out

#s6
and I like to run uh m-

#s7
I 'm I like to run get my heartbeat up

#s8
I like to run about oh about two two and a half miles

#s9
And then I like to work out on uh on the uh the Bailey Life C- Cycle machines up here at the at the Holiday Spa

#s10
And and I I think that you know

#s11
I 've had a regiment now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that

#s12
and uh and I I kind of think it 's uh it 's a lot of work

#s13
but I think it 's uh it 's a lot of work

#s14
but I think it 's uh it 's the uh the amount of effort that 's required to uh to stay healthy you know

#s15
I have a sedentary job

#s16
and uh unless you do something like that y- you 're going to get sick

#s31
Well I uh two years ago I started having trouble with my knee

#s32
And uh you know I 've got you know

#s33
I figured well it 'll go away

#s34
Well I s- you know I 'm I 've had to reduce my program reduce my program

#s35
and I 've gained fifteen pounds

#s37
And so uh you know it 's e- you know

#s38
I need to get back into swimming you know instead of running

#s39
If I ca n't swim or I ca n't run I should be able to swim

#s40
Well I 'm such a terrible swimmer

#s41
and I I I really feel I can I can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes f- to this effort

#s42
But if it gets longer than that I I i- it I start not doing anything

#s44
And so so I got a real problem in that regard

#s45
Uh it

#s46
do

#s47
you obviously are are not an exercise buff

#s48
or else you 'd be out there doing it

#s54
Well it 's it 's always a chore

#s55
I mean I started doing this when I was about thirty-five

#s58
and now I 'm fifty-five

#s60
And uh you know I I know that in I just know that I 'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense

#s61
Y- you know some health related thing is going to blow me away

#s62
That 's the same way

#s63
I got too much weight on right now

#s64
I need to lose fifty pounds you know

#s66
I need to lose at least twenty you know

#s67
But uh you know it 's it 's just uh I 'm busy

#s68
I 'm doing a lot of traveling

#s69
and uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you 're on the road

#s70
What sort of uh uh what other programs other than say running

#s71
Have you have you ever done anything at all

#s79
Uh-huh

#s82
MUMBLEx club what club are you with

#s84
What club were you with

#s86
Oh Okay

#s87
So you 're you 're down you 're downtown

#s90
Okay

#s91
Yeah

#s92
You 're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and F G

#s95
Oh

#s96
Well I 'd uh

#s97
well there 's a there 's a Holiday Spa down there on on K street I think Something like that

#s98
But uh I I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria

#s99
and that 's pretty good

#s100
But you know evening time it gets pretty busy

#s101
But generally you know I can I can get in and get a program you know

#s103
But uh you know I I need to I need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this

#s104
and uh I got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it

#s105
I mean I 've been doing this for fifteen twenty years

#s107
And you know and I 'm I know I 'm going to get I know it 's going to bite me in the ass

#s108
and so I I really do n't want to want to uh you know back off on it

#s116
Well no

#s117
When you 're young you you can abuse your your all your systems

#s118
and you can recover

#s120
Uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye you know

#s122
And uh and so the object
