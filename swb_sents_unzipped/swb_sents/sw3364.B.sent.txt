I 've watched that for about twelve years

#s81
I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed

#s83
So that was a long time ago

#s84
I used to watch it in high school and college when Laura 's mother got killed

#s86
She was my favorite character on there

#s87
I just

#s88
I read the reason she got they they killed her off was because they could n't settle a contract

#s89
and I said well if they 're going to do that to her I wo n't watch it

#s96
I I I like it

#s97
I just wish they 'd bring some of the old characters back

#s101
Yeah

#s102
I 'm sure he will

#s104
I kind of wish that uh Nina would come back because she because the story you know

#s106
just for a brief visit or whatever because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying and everything

#s110
Yeah

#s111
Cliff 's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now

#s114
Yeah

#s117
Uh

#s119
that 's how they left the show but not in real life

#s121
Now she 's married to some guy in New York

#s122
and she 's happily married

#s123
and that 's the reason she left the show

#s124
I guess she wanted a private life

#s128

I watch it everyday religiously

#s133
I videotape it when I have to miss it

#s146
And then and then uh uh the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART

#s148

#s153
She 's taken the Suzanne 's part

#s154
