Do you know anyone that uh is is in a nursing home or has ever been in one

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Well I 'm trying to think

#s8
My uh uh wife 's grandmother had Alzheimer 's

#s9
and they were going to put her into a a nursing home

#s10
and uh they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble

#s11
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance Or worse than a nuisance

#s12
I mean she sort of went you know bananas

#s14
and they could n't could n't deal with her

#s15
So I guess you need to uh know whether it 's a you know a no deposit no return kind of thing whether

#s18
Yeah

#s20
Right

#s23
Right

#s24
My grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that uh

#s25
there was a retirement hotel and then a uh

#s26
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it

#s27
so for uh the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes But could could also go and eat someplace else

#s29
And then uh as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to uh provide full-time care

#s30
and uh she did n't have to do anything anymore

#s31
But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly

#s32
And that 's som-

#s33
I do n't know whether that 's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the the reason is

#s34
But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something

#s36
Yeah

#s39
Right

#s41
Yeah

#s42
If if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are

#s43
Then you only go there as a last resort

#s45
Or people send you there as a last resort

#s50
Uh-huh

#s53
Right

#s55
Right

#s57
Yeah

#s58
I guess

#s62
Right

#s63
When you need it you need it I guess

#s66
Right

#s69
Yeah

#s72
Sure

#s74
And you probably if it were you you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price

#s81
Yeah

#s82
Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth continuing

#s86
Yeah

#s88
Right

#s89
Yeah

#s90
I 've known quite a few people that have uh gone to retirement communities

#s91
I do n't know if they have them back there

#s92
but here in California and in Ari-
