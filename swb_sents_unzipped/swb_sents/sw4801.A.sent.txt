#s1
What do you think about capital punishment

#s3
Yeah

#s4
Which crimes do you feel that

#s6
Yeah

#s7
Because of

#s8
so many times it 's so brutal and just recurrent

#s10
selling I think should also

#s13
Yeah

#s16
Uh-huh

#s19
Yeah

#s20
that 's

#s22
Go ahead

#s23
Texas is too

#s24
Texas I saw on T V the other night is the has had forty-six in like the past several years

#s26
So they 're pretty hip on it too I guess

#s27
They do it by lethal injection at Huntsville

#s31
Yeah

#s34
Yeah

#s38
Yeah

#s42
Yeah

#s45
Yeah

#s46
That 's what 's happening here

#s47
There is

#s48
like uh that 's

#s49
in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of uh r- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again

#s54
Uh-huh

#s56
Yeah

#s58
I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who does n't

#s60
Be a little more you know

#s61
not being able to put it off for fifteen years

#s71
Oh really

#s73
Goodness

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
Yeah

#s80
Yeah

#s84
I yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient

#s86
Uh kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty

#s89
I 'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas

#s93
Uh audiology

#s97
Yeah

#s98
What do you do

#s100
Oh really

#s103
Oh really

#s105
Neat

#s112
Yeah

#s113
I just

#s114
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California

#s116
So I think it

#s117
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what

#s119
they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then

#s124
Yeah

#s126
Uh they they do n't get repealed as easily as they do

#s128
Like the guy in California got thir- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber

#s129
and then they said okay no

#s130
you do n't have to go

#s131
And then they took him back

#s132
I mean it just seems Yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent

#s135
And then you have like two

#s136
you have these people who are serial killers that did n't even get the death sentence back when ever you know

#s145
No

#s146
I do n't I do n't think

#s147
uh the military does n't execute anymore

#s148
so

#s150
Or death before the firing squad or whatever

#s152
So I think about the only one is uh rape
