#s2
No

#s3
I 've not

#s4
I 've been called

#s5
but I had to beg off from the duty

#s6
And you

#s9
Um

#s10
Well I was I was uh originally chosen primarily I think because I was a young fellow

#s11
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict

#s12
I do n't know why

#s13
Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago

#s15
Yeah

#s16
it 's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason

#s17
and they kind of liked me

#s18
I looked conser- and all that stuff

#s19
and they

#s20
I do n't know what they saw in me

#s21
but they saw it

#s22
But uh back to the issue

#s23
is uh

#s24
I do n't know

#s25
at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun

#s26
But there too there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly I think in civil cases

#s27
In criminal cases I 'd like to see the unani- unanimity remain

#s28
but in civil cases I think a majority rule by by jury would be sufficient

#s30
Well in a criminal case say one in which you know there is like say assault or some such I think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this

#s31
And in civil law there you know is such a thing as like let 's say uh misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that

#s32
A majority rule I think would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases

#s33
I do n't know if I 'm making any sense or not

#s37
Yeah

#s38
often there 's more incriminating evidence

#s39
Like for instance say uh

#s40
and also too I think I 'm I 'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious in a criminal case

#s42
Um well I really ca n't say for certain truth be known

#s43
Uh as it stands there 's there 's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a civil uh civil and criminal case

#s44
I mean the uh documentary the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that

#s45
You know I do n't know for if you 're familiar with that or not

#s48
A uh fellow when he was much younger uh was tried and convicted and sentenced to death

#s49
Fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked

#s50
and uh so he served out his his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system

#s51
The case was reopened

#s52
and he was exonerated

#s54
Yeah

#s55
many laws but little justice

#s59
Oh certainly not

#s60
certainly not

#s61
And you know they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this

#s62
but they 're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers ' desires

#s63
You know the

#s64
because you get up

#s65
and and they ask you a few questions

#s66
both sides do

#s67
and then you you 're either challenged which is you know

#s68
each attorney can use that as much as they like

#s69
or I think it 's a limit now

#s70
they probably have a limit now

#s71
but they pretty much go through that

#s72
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you ca n't serve

#s73
For me it was financial hardship

#s74
so But onto the thing uh

#s75
I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing

#s76
It was always my impression that the Justice himself or herself had the final say
