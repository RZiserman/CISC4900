#s3
Uh I guess

#s4
I do n't know

#s5
It 's the first time I 've made a phone call on it

#s7
Right

#s11
I read uh a lot of Steven King Dean R Koontz uh some Danielle Steel

#s13
My aunt got me hooked on those

#s15
So I

#s17
Yeah

#s18
they 're all novels

#s20
I 'll read some uh classic too

#s22
Uh like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck

#s23
I 'll uh

#s27
A A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner That 's one of my favorites

#s29
Oh and this this is more of a play or something that that it was from that that I saw

#s30
and I read the book from that

#s32
And by the way my name 's Bill

#s33
I 'm from North Carolina

#s36
Uh I

#s37
let 's see

#s38
What kind of books do you like to read

#s41
I really have to be in the mood

#s43
I I read one like maybe once a year

#s45
I 'm not as

#s49
I 've never read anything by him

#s54
Yeah

#s57
Okay

#s61
I like to read a lot of non fiction history when Civil War era and and that kind of thing

#s64
I found that real interesting

#s65
I 'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now

#s66
And that was on T V

#s68
It was uh during Teddy Roosevelt 's time And uh about a American woman that got kidnapped in uh Morocco

#s71
Uh this is when they were having their revolution or whatever

#s73
and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over

#s74
and really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man you know

#s76
Surprised me

#s77
I had no idea that he was like that

#s80
Well just like s- some one quote that he had was that he thought the America 's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle

#s81
and it should be a grizzly bear because

#s83
you you know like the t- t- grizzly and stuff like that

#s84
So it 's

#s85
I saw the movie

#s86
and that 's what made me want to read the book

#s88
Candice Bergen was in the movie

#s89
I 'm a real big fan of hers

#s90
so

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
I like I like to read some of the philosophy stuff

#s101
Yeah

#s102
I think that

#s104
I 'm fascinated by that

#s105
Yeah

#s106
I 'm fascinated by that

#s109
That

#s110
and and uh even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses

#s112
I like

#s113
I 'm kind of a doubting Thomas

#s114
and I like to read stuff like that

#s115
Some of it really freaks me out

#s121
And I like to read uh I like to read some self help books like uh

#s122
I read DIANETICS once once

#s123
I got past all the gibberish on it

#s125
It was okay

#s126
It it it it took me a while to really get into it

#s127
It it did n't help me that much

#s130
But uh I think once you 're set in your ways you 're set in your ways

#s132
Uh then I

#s133
one in- real interesting book I read recently was when I was looking for a job

#s134
I read HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED

#s135
and it it had real good tips

#s136
and it

#s137
and I got the job that I wanted by applying the the methods that that
