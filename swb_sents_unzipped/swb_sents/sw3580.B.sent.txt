#s5
Yeah

#s6
I I agree

#s8
it 's definitely new frontier stuff

#s14
I I I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time

#s16
Yeah

#s18
Well actually I 'm I I 'm quite versed lately

#s19
I get on a computer network all the time

#s20
and people are talking about about the current space program all the time

#s21
They 're talking about new rockets that they 're designing now that you know are just like science fiction you know

#s22
it 's like they take off you know

#s23
and then they land with the with the you know

#s24
the afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad

#s27
Yeah

#s28
it 's called V C X or something like that

#s29
Also called Delta Clipper which is a decent name for something like that

#s33
Oh yeah

#s35
I think I would

#s36
I think that 'd be neat

#s42
Well you know I had a car uh uh a tire come off of a car

#s43
so you know I like I know what it 's like to

#s46
Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home

#s50
Yeah

#s51
they 're talking about doing that again too

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Well at least we 're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years

#s56
Yeah

#s57
and they 're going to put

#s59
Yeah

#s64
Oh yeah

#s65
yeah

#s69
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s75
Uh-huh

#s77
Yeah

#s78
I uh

#s79
it 's it 's it 's something definitely that uh you know

#s80
it 's it 's uh got the extra little oomph of interest

#s82
Uh

#s85
Yeah

#s86
Yeah

#s87
I wish uh

#s88
like uh Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy uh a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it you know purely commercial

#s91
and they 'd go up you know and do things

#s92
and

#s94
Oh

#s95
No

#s96
it 's still probably going

#s97
but I do n't know whether it it research will go on

#s100
Oh yeah

#s101
Well they 're they 're going to be cutting back so much on just you know the number of troops we 've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here

#s106
But uh Russia 's still going to have missiles

#s107
they 're still going to be subs and things

#s110
Yeah

#s112
Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that Russia itself that was going to have them

#s114
At least that was you know that 's what everybody says

#s115
Oh yeah

#s116
yeah

#s117
we want only Russia to have them

#s119
And now they 're saying Yeah

#s120
yeah

#s121
you 're a republic

#s122
you do n't want those

#s123
you do n't want those

#s128
Uh-huh

#s132
One hopes

#s136
Uh-huh

#s138
Yeah
