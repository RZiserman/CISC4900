At least you uh follow the game a little bit

Do you plan on staying in in the Dallas area

#s119
Oh uh-huh

#s125
Yeah

#s126
uh I think Texas San Antonio in particular has got a large uh base of hospitals

#s127
Uh I do n't know about Dallas

#s128
I think Dallas is pretty scattered

#s130
No

#s131
I 'm I 'm in Dallas

#s133
but I 'm originally from San Antonio

#s135
and they 've got large medical uh center down there

#s136
They 've got the U T Health Science Center out there also

#s138
So if ever wanted you know pursue anything more than your nursing degree that that 'd be the place to do it
