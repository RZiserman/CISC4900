#s2
Okay

#s5
You were helping your parents

#s9
Uh-huh

#s13
So you 're remodeling

#s15
Okay

#s17
Well I I just live in a I live in an apartment now

#s18
I uh two summers ago I went to Massachusetts

#s20
and I went with a friend of mine

#s21
and we undertook a building house

#s23
And this was a a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions

#s24
and it 's preconstructed you might say

#s26
And we started in uh we started from an empty lot with uh trees and stuff on it

#s27
and we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot

#s28
We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement Pour the basement

#s29
and uh went from the ground up

#s31
Our one of our main problems was

#s33
well in Massachusetts I thought I was going to

#s34
well it was a a fun time

#s35
but I thought gosh summer time you know

#s37
Well all it ever did was rain and thunder storms

#s38
And one thing is that we 're we had we were going to pour the basement foundation

#s40
And we 're in the process

#s41
and it started pouring down rain

#s43
And I guess we had most of it done

#s44
but the end was result

#s45
what happened was that some of the the wa- a lot of water settled on the top

#s46
and it really did n't give a very good finish

#s47
and some of the

#s48
it was sort of sandy and and not uh a very good finish

#s51
But it turned it was okay

#s52
and it 's only the basement floor

#s53
so it was okay

#s55
But uh it kept us pretty busy

#s56
It was only uh

#s57
there was well me and my friend

#s58
and then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a a family type

#s60
it was n't you know like a commercial project or something

#s61
It was sort of just you know uh gets your get his you know my bro- my brother and well maybe you know my cousin 's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes

#s64
And and then materials coming in

#s66
and so we 're we 're hopping around pretty good

#s67
But overall yeah we got it done

#s68
and it 's a three bedroom two bath house

#s69
and it 's pretty neat

#s71
Yeah

#s72
So

#s76
Well it was uh for my friend 's parents

#s77
They had some property there

#s78
and they 'd lived in this this old

#s79
it 's sort of like a farm you might say

#s80
And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something

#s82
And his mom just wanted a a new house You know

#s84
that has been her dream

#s85
And so we did that

#s86
And uh she was really pleased with it

#s87
So it came really great

#s89
so

#s91
So what why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot

#s93
Where you live it gets very hot

#s96
And that 's why you

#s97
an- and the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in

#s99
Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in uh you know the solar game

#s101
Have you

#s102
what what are you putting in

#s103
triple glaze or double glaze or

#s107
Oh okay

#s108
Okay

#s111
Uh-huh

#s115
Okay

#s116
Oh these

#s117
so you have the sash windows in

#s119
Did t- uh did it go up and down

#s121
Oh I see

#s124
Uh-huh

#s126
Yes

#s127
there 's a problem with those

#s128
Those are uh

#s129
they usually most of the time do n't open very well

#s132
Uh-huh

#s135
Uh-huh

#s136
Uh-huh

#s137
And they also there they they

#s138
a lot of vibration

#s139
and it causes the glass to crack

#s140
and it 's a never ending problem

#s144
So So I have n't uh I have n't been in any really home repair things lately

#s145
I
