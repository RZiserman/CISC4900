#s1
Okay

#s3
Um I like watching COLOMBO and um MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP

#s5
yeah

#s7
Uh-huh

#s9
Um

#s10
uh-huh

#s12
Yeah

#s13
that one was

#s14
What about

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
yeah

#s22
Oh I well I have n't seen either of those

#s24
Huh-uh

#s26
Um I also like to watch STAR TREK

#s27
but it 's on so late here that I do n't always get to see it

#s32
Uh I have n't seen any of the movies because I just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it

#s33
and they 're you know already out with number six by now

#s34
but So I have n't seen any of the movies yet

#s35
but I

#s37
No

#s41
Uh-huh

#s44
Yeah

#s45
I 've seen quite a few of the older ones

#s46
I have n't seen really the new generation that much

#s49
Is there one you prefer better

#s50
the older one or the youn- the newer one

#s53
Oh yeah

#s56
Yeah

#s57
I do too

#s58
I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot

#s59
I mean he almost hates the new ones

#s61
Yeah

#s62
because he he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one is n't or something

#s63
but I do n't

#s67
Oh I think

#s68
Yeah

#s73
Yeah

#s74
sure

#s75
Well let 's see

#s76
Um I like to watch COLOMBO because it 's like a mystery thing

#s78
That 's sort of how Matlock is

#s79
but COLOMBO is way tricky

#s81
I mean he does n't even try to let the person know he 's getting onto them

#s84
Well did you see the one

#s85
Um

#s87
Um yeah

#s88
there 's like one on

#s89
well we see it Thursdays at seven

#s90
and it was

#s92
this last time it was about this um movie director

#s93
did you hap-

#s96
did you see that

#s98
Really

#s99
Oh I guess I nev-

#s102
Huh

#s106
Oh I guess I 've I have n't seen it before

#s109
Yeah

#s111
yeah

#s112
on the set or something

#s114
Yeah

#s115
it was

#s116
But yeah

#s117
I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things

#s119
But um there 's no never anything good on Saturdays though

#s121
I do n't think so

#s122
Well STAR TREK 'S on at five

#s123
but I 'm never home

#s124
so

#s129
Oh

#s131
I 've heard of it a lot

#s132
I 've heard of a lot of people somehow or something

#s133
They 'll say so and so from TWIN PEAKS or something you know

#s137
Oh

#s139
Uh-huh

#s141
Oh did they end the whole series

#s143
Oh

#s146
