Taxes

#s4
Do we pay too much

#s8
Well do we

#s10
Um

#s13
My tax bracket is is pretty high up there

#s14
I pay the I generally pay the maximum tax bracket

#s16
And uh I think that we 're paying too much

#s17
because I do n't have any children

#s19
And I pay a lot of property taxes

#s21
I do n't have any um I do n't you know I do n't use an awful lot of city services

#s22
It it you know it 's like I have to work m- I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes

#s26
And um y- there 's so many people who want a a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is

#s28
and I just

#s29
sometimes many times I end up feeling like I 'm paying too much in taxes

#s31
How about you

#s32
Do you pay too much

#s39
Well when you when you go out into the uh when you go out into the working world it it changes quickly

#s43
Um you look at your paycheck

#s44
and you go oh my gosh where did it all go

#s45
Um what kind of what kind of

#s46
uh well have you pay a lot of in ta-

#s47
have you been out working and then gone back to school

#s48
or are you did you go directly from high school into into college

#s52
To worry about it

#s54
Have you have you been active in in politics trying to concerning this

#s55
Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that

#s59
I uh I have n't done any of that type of work myself

#s61
Um but every once in a while when I hear up here at at uh in D C area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the Congress

#s62
um Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there you know

#s63
there 's a bank that they all bank with

#s64
and I guess it went defunct recently

#s66
And one of the Congressmen has has written in the last three years al- about a thousand bad checks

#s68
And we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho- all those bad checks

#s69
no interest

#s70
no repayment schedule

#s73
And um it 's causing quite a stir up here because we 're so close to D C anyway

#s76
It 's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur

#s78
Um I I I think we pay too much

#s79
And I 've I look at my paycheck

#s80
and I make

#s81
well let 's see

#s82
They take out in state and federal taxes

#s84
I think I pay forty-two percent

#s86
Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government

#s87
and then they charge me sales tax

#s88
and they charge me gasoline taxes

#s91
and they charge me all these others

#s92
and it 's just too expensive

#s94
I ca n't believe that

#s95
I I 'm just thankful that I do n't get all the government that I pay for

#s97
You know what I mean

#s99
Do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government

#s105
What are you studying down there

#s107
Physics

#s109
Oh that sounds like a fun fun field

#s111
Scientific

#s113
Heavy science

#s114
Are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that

#s115
or is it more um applied physics

#s120
Okay

#s121
Well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that 's come rolling towards whatever it 's rolling toward

#s124
Actually I do n't think we are

#s127
Um like like Europe um England I know the taxes are a lot higher

#s131
But they do have socialized medicine and things like that

#s133
And um I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that um they 're talking

#s134
or maybe it was on the radi-
