#s1
I said Arlington Texas because the other day I was talking with somebody and he was in Arlington Virginia

#s3
Yeah

#s4
that 's the only one I 've got now for this area

#s6
Well anyway we 've got a easy subject

#s9
You go ahead first if you 'd like

#s14
Yeah

#s15
you know you get so busy

#s19
Oh

#s30
Are they little

#s32
Yeah

#s33
they 're pretty young

#s37
I do n't know

#s38
my kids are older

#s40
so I do n't I do n't know some of those shows now like I used to

#s42
yeah

#s44
Right

#s45
Yeah

#s46
Well I I like the comedies

#s47
They 're just light too

#s48
I have to watch MURPHY BROWN

#s49
I really like

#s51
I make a point of that

#s53
Yeah

#s55
I love that

#s56
and I really like COACH

#s57
I think it 's when it 's good it 's just a scream

#s62
Well he 's probably playing himself

#s63
Half the time you see these people on an interview show they 're they act just like they do in their parts

#s66
He

#s67
I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once

#s68
and he acted about the same

#s72
and uh

#s75
Well I watch more now because well I I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy

#s77
but this semester I 'm only taking one course

#s78
and so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS

#s79
I just make a point of seeing those

#s82
Oh it 's fabulous

#s83
Really you should never miss that

#s84
It they are just gems of shows

#s85
I mean they

#s86
really fabulous in every way

#s89
Oh that 's Wednesday at uh seven thirty

#s95
Oh yeah

#s96
so

#s97
Sure

#s99
well maybe maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime

#s102
Just so you get the idea

#s103
It would n't take Would n't take much to get hooked on those

#s107
So so I watch those

#s110
Well you know I have n't oh

#s111
yeah

#s112
we started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE

#s113
Well it 's not really new

#s114
but it 's still kind of new

#s116
uh-huh

#s119
I like it a lot

#s120
It 's real different

#s121
In fact they never thought it would be a hit

#s122
Huh

#s123
I mean they 'll have some things in there that almost almost you know like supernatural or something you know

#s124
I mean somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does

#s125
or I mean it sounds weird

#s126
but it 's very uh unique show and very well done

#s127
Huh

#s128
Excellent actors

#s130
I I guess we just

#s131
it came on after something we used to watch

#s134
and I guess we just kept sitting there

#s135
and then now we make a point of watching

#s136
I ca n't take all these shows on because next semester I 'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television

#s138
Well then it will be mostly reruns I guess

#s141
And by the end of February the way they do it nowadays

#s146
Yeah

#s148
I 've seen that

#s149
Was she the was she the best one

#s150
Was she the best one on that old show

#s152
Really

#s157
right

#s159
Yeah

#s160
they had a big fight on that show did n't they

#s161
Yeah

#s163
They were all accusing each other of everything in the world

#s166
Well I know

#s167
gosh you never will probably

#s171
Well I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable

#s173
I do n't have cable

#s179
It 's just as wild as any soap opera from what I hear on the news

#s181
And I think he 's guilty as the devil

#s184
what 's in it for her

#s185
There 's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that Because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers

#s186
Yeah

#s189
Um

#s191
I know

#s192
everybody was saying that

#s193
and then in the paper said it

#s194
so It should be interesting

#s195
Yeah

#s197
Well the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says

#s198
I was reading that in the supermarket line

#s199
I never have the nerve to buy the thing

#s203
Says he

#s205
No

#s206
I do n't care anything about that

#s210
I like the ice skating you know

#s211
occasionally some ice skating will come on on a Sunday or during the Olympics

#s213
I always watch that

#s214
I think it 's so beautiful

#s217
Oh yeah

#s218
that 's good
