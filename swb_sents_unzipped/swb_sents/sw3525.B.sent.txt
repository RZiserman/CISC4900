I think golf is n't it

#s5
Are you a hacker

#s10
I know I Oh I know I did

#s11
I know I did

#s13
Course I know I watch my thirteen year old play now you know

#s14
and it 's like they do n't have a muscle in their body

#s23
Uh-huh

#s25
Sure

#s29
Yeah

#s32
That 's what it takes

#s33
you you need to play that often to get a really good handicap

#s38
Well I went to

#s39
I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more

#s40
and I I went after it

#s41
and did and I really did n't find much improvement

#s42
Fact ever time I 'd start trying to correct something it seemed like the score would go go back up

#s44
yeah

#s45
I I think I need to uh

#s47
I probably need to take some some more lessons uh more current and uh and practice more often

#s49
Spend more time on the

#s55
Uh-huh

#s60
Uh-huh

#s62
Oh yeah

#s63
Oh yeah

#s64
I 'm familiar with it

#s69
Oh yeah

#s70
if you play regular I think it makes a big difference

#s73
Yeah

#s74
yeah

#s75
I well I 've also found too

#s76
I I try to work out regularly

#s77
and when I am doing that uh and feeling loose and that I swing better

#s78
I I I get through the ball better

#s79
Uh and I also if I

#s80
I found as I 've gotten a little older here I worry less about my distance

#s82
And I

#s83
my control is a little bit better there

#s85
Uh so

#s93
Uh-huh

#s95
Uh-huh

#s96
Have you ever have you ever tried a one iron

#s101
Uh-huh

#s103
Well you know I put mine back in my bag this year too

#s104
and I I used a three wood rather than a driver

#s106
Uh I had a lot more control on it uh

#s107
I sacrificed distance

#s108
but I was n't in trouble every time I got down the fairway

#s116
Uh-huh

#s119
Oh yeah

#s120
absolutely

#s123
Yeah

#s124
well I I read recently here they say if you 're playing if you 're scoring well you should play more

#s125
If you 're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice g- uh range

#s127
Uh I think there is less flus- frustration factor there too uh

#s129
So but I I

#s130
the one iron is something I 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that I I should pick one up and try to start

#s131
Apparently they 're very difficult to play with

#s132
but with practice I would imagine you could groove that swing too

#s133
And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron

#s134
it 's incredible

#s136
And but and his accuracy is what 's so startling with it

#s137
And I

#s138
and it but it 's an iron that he 's really practiced with

#s139
He has used a lot

#s140
and uh it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron Uh distance iron

#s147
And get away without embarrassing yourself
