#s3
Uh you hit you hit uh

#s4
it does n't matter

#s5
Um we 're discussing the capital punishment I believe

#s10
Uh which

#s11
I am am pro capital punishment except that I do n't like the way it 's done

#s15
Uh-huh

#s17
I I agree

#s18
I I 'm

#s19
capital

#s20
the

#s21
capital punishment is necessary in in many cases

#s22
but uh the

#s23
it 's not a deterrent um

#s24
or our jails would not be so full

#s25
There would n't be so many people in Death Row

#s27
I think it needs to be something uh uh a throwback to where they did a uh public execution where it 's visible

#s29
Uh something you know not gruesome but but something more where people know that it it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people

#s30
If you committed a certain crime you were going to receive a death penalty

#s31
and it was going to happen to you

#s33
No stays of execution

#s34
No no loopholes

#s35
no

#s39
Notoriety

#s45
Ye- yes

#s46
but but they they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal

#s48
They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years

#s50
That they are going to write a book

#s51
They are going to go on talk shows

#s52
they 're goin-

#s53
that that that 's a reward uh for a heinous crime rather than uh having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life

#s56
In in complete uh

#s57
MUMBLEx of any notoriety

#s60
Uh-huh

#s61
Right

#s63
Right

#s68
Uh-huh

#s71
Well yes

#s72
they will

#s74
It

#s75
Oh MUMBLEx

#s76
well that 's correct

#s77
yes

#s78
Ye-

#s79
if if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is it is executed

#s82
Yeah

#s83
But but the the the chances are not great that that will happen

#s85
But there 's a greater chance that he 'll be back out on the streets in twelve years

#s92
Uh-huh

#s93
Uh-huh

#s94
That 's right

#s97
Yes

#s99
Why you know y- y- you could carry it to that if uh if they are a repeat offender

#s100
and and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this

#s101
Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up um you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes

#s103
and of course uh of battery or assault or that is not a capital crime see

#s104
You you would n't be able to under our system

#s106
Now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that

#s107
Um you get caught with dope there and you die period

#s110
There is there is no no appeals

#s111
There is no
