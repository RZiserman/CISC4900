Do I have pets

#s4
Yes

#s5
I have a cat

#s6
and I have two dogs

#s9
I have a Schnauzer

#s10
and I have a Sheltie

#s13
It it 's a miniature

#s15
Uh-huh

#s16
Oh okay

#s18
Well the Schnauzer I 'm I 'm watching for one of uh the managers where I work

#s19
and he 's been transferred to Germany for a while

#s21
and I 'm taking care of his dog

#s22
and uh and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that

#s23
and he says well my dog does n't like cats

#s24
and I said well we wo n't tell him it 's a c- we wo n't tell her it 's a cat because it was a kitten

#s25
and you know they just they just love kittens

#s27
They just are fascinated

#s29
So she does n't know that this is a cat yet

#s32
And they get along real good

#s33
I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he 'd flip

#s34
So that was interesting

#s41
It 's a sheltie

#s43
She 's real s- sweet little dog

#s44
She 's got a very nice temperament

#s45
Uh they 're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer

#s47
You know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive

#s49
Uh-huh

#s54
They 're a good temperament

#s56
and they and they just uh

#s57
I think they have a good head on their shoulders

#s58
I think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that I have encountered

#s60
Well yeah

#s61
but also some poodles uh

#s63
they 're kind of

#s64
there are some smart ones out there

#s65
but there 's some also some uh not so smart ones

#s69
Yeah

#s70
that 's that 's maybe that 's there 's uh some credence in that statement

#s74
Uh-huh

#s76
I I 'd I really do n't know what the best pet is

#s78
I guess it 's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal

#s81
Um And bull dogs

#s82
But I do n't know about these uh these uh uh these pincers these now what are they called Pit bulls pit bulls that are so vicious

#s86
Are they really

#s87
I do n't think I 've ever seen one

#s92
Well how do they become s-

#s93
w-

#s94
how did they get their reputation then

#s96
Oh they train them to be that way then

#s98
Oh okay

#s100
Oh okay

#s103
Oh dear

#s104
so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection

#s106
Oh dear

#s110
Uh-huh

#s117
Uh-huh

#s118
Well that 's unusual

#s120
I

#s121
Huh well I suppose you were surprised

#s123
After the reputation that you know

#s126
they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know

#s128
Yeah

#s129
they 're banned from in some areas I understand

#s131
Uh-huh

#s133
You know that

#s134
they must have just targeted that breed and said boy we 're going

#s138
Oh okay

#s139
Oh okay

#s140
Uh-huh

#s143
Uh-huh

#s147
Oh did it attack the child then

#s150
Uh-huh

#s153
Well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that

#s157
Um Sure

#s159
yeah

#s161
Yeah

#s162
because then the the animal 's in trouble and not the person
