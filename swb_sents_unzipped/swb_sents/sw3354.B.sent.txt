Well uh typical lawn stuff

#s4
Saint Augustine uh with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas

#s7
uh and really all I do to it is

#s8
uh in fact I did n't even fertilize it this year

#s9
I just mowed it

#s10
and I I mow it uh you know with a mulch mower so the the particles fall down

#s12
Yeah

#s15
I do it myself

#s18
Have a lot of people trying to do it for me

#s21
Hey I need the exercise

#s22
so what the heck

#s28

Pittosporum is kind of borderline here

#s137

#s172
It did pretty well

#s173

#s176
and uh our our garages come in from the back you know from the alley

#s179

#s181
Well I had uh tomatoes and and uh uh peppers

#s182
and I had I had okra

#s184
and by the fence I had cucumbers which which did n't do real well uh

#s186
