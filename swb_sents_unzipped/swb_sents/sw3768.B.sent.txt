#s2
Well we 've uh we 've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe

#s3
so So I I guess those are the types I like

#s6
We 've really enjoyed them

#s9
We 've gone to um Germany Switzerland Austria Ireland and England

#s11
We 've been to Germany twice

#s13
But um I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
Where have you been

#s22
Uh-huh

#s25
Oh how neat

#s31
Uh-huh

#s33

You lived in Africa

#s44
Oh my goodness

#s46
Wow

#s48
Uh-huh

#s51
It 's so expensive over there

#s55
It really is

#s56
It just it 's it 's

#s57
I love to go over there

#s58
but it 's so darn expensive to go over

#s63
Yeah

#s65
Oh I know

#s66
just

#s67
Right

#s68
Then you can stay with them

#s69
and yeah

#s72
Yeah

#s74
You know there 's a lot of places in the states that we have n't even gone

#s76
You know I 'd like to go to Hawaii some time

#s77
and and uh we made it

#s79
we 've we 've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls

#s80
So

#s83
Feel like we 've accomplished a little bit here

#s87
Uh-huh

#s89
Uh-huh

#s91
The oh the

#s92

#s93
I 've always wanted to go there

#s94
I 've seen pictures

#s95
and and it looks gorgeous

#s97
We um we made a trip up the East Coast

#s98
It was uh in the summer

#s100
and it really is pretty

#s102
It 's uh

#s103
both coasts are really pretty

#s105
but um I love the Carolinas

#s106
It 's just gorgeous over there

#s109
Yeah

#s111
Uh-huh

#s113
Well you 'll just have to plan a vacation some time and and go over there

#s116
Yeah

#s117
but there 's you know there 's a lot to see here

#s119
but I just love going over to Europe because it 's so their way of life is just so different than ours

#s121
You know we 're so fast paced here

#s122
and over there you know every time we 'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we 'd always have to ask for the check you know

#s125
they 're so leisurely over there

#s127
and it 's kind of nice to to have that

#s131
Well usually a bunch of different places

#s134
Right

#s135

#s171
and they

#s172
