#s1
Okay

#s2
what kind of foods would you have

#s5
Oh I do too

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Yeah

#s11
you ca n't enjoy it

#s12
Right

#s15
That 's that 's what

#s16
I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven

#s18
it 's

#s20
everybody just says how wonderful it is

#s21
and it 's it 's like uh yes

#s23
I

#s25
That 's one of those things I got famous for in college

#s26
People would come and say could y- would you come over and make lasagna for me

#s28
It 's like well I ca n't really give you a recipe uh

#s31
I can I can just do it

#s33
I like doing that kind of stuff

#s35
And it 's it 's fun

#s36
in fact that 's what we had for a Christmas party last week

#s38
We just had a bunch of people over

#s39
and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread

#s40
and uh yummy

#s42
Uh I do too in fact

#s46
Oh

#s47
Oh good

#s49
Uh actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it 's a real easy is just baked potato dinners

#s52
And have you know like three or four couples come over

#s53
and I 'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like

#s55
and it turns out great because I mean you 've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff

#s59
But it 's it 's inexpensive

#s61
plus it 's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it

#s62
and you got a great dinner

#s65
It 's it 's real easy

#s66
I like doing that part

#s68
I 'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning because we 've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games

#s72
and it 's

#s74
we invariably end up at my house since I 've got two kids

#s76
And that it 's it 's fine because then I can just say Okay fine

#s77
you bring this

#s78
you bring this

#s79
you bring this

#s80
we 're done

#s82
And it 's pretty cool

#s86
Uh-huh

#s87
Oh

#s89
Oh

#s91
Oh I love it

#s98
Um

#s102
Over the uncooked rice

#s105
Oh

#s108
Oh how neat

#s111
Huh

#s112
Now I 've done it with where you put you cook the ri- well I guess you probably could do it same way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it

#s116
And every once in a while I 'll put in I 'll slice white grapes

#s117
and I 'll put in there

#s118
and that 's just because I 'm not a real big wine person

#s119
but I like it

#s120
it adds something to the chicken

#s123
And then just bake it

#s124
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice

#s126
Yeah

#s128
It 's that was one of the first things I made for my husband because I was like um

#s129
yeah

#s131
I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of

#s135
Oh yeah

#s137
But then I had n't thought about doing it with uncooked rice

#s139
So just like in a thirteen by nine pan

#s142
Um

#s147
Um

#s150
Uh-huh

#s154
Yeah

#s155
yeah

#s156
I I use that for br- for rice

#s157
and for when I cook pasta or something I 'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor

#s162
Um Now that would be good

#s164
How long do you have to bake it

#s168
I do I do microwave too a lot

#s171
How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave

#s175
Oh okay

#s176
Okay

#s177
Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored

#s179
or do you go ahead and let it cook through

#s181
Um

#s182
Ooh this is a beneficial call

#s183
I like this

#s186
Yeah

#s187
but that one 's an easy one

#s188
It 's like just put in

#s189
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine

#s191
put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that you know What ever however much effort you feel like putting into it

#s194
But it it makes a great

#s195
I mean I 've got a two year old and a four year old

#s196
and they love it

#s198
And because my daughter calls it her gravy

#s199
and I mean she thinks it 's wonderful

#s200
my good you 're a picky eater if I can get you to
