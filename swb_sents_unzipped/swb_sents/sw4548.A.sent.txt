#s1
Well actually uh

#s2
I I do n't think I 'm in the uh majority of in in Texas

#s3
I do n't think I agree with

#s5
No

#s7
Uh I would n't say that

#s8
I think I would have said that a few years ago

#s9
When I was younger I thought it was uh a sign of a civilized society if you did n't have uh capital punishment

#s10
but um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion

#s12
I 'm not thoroughly opposed to it

#s13
I still think it 's sort of true that a more civilized society would n't have to use capital punishment

#s14
but I 'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought

#s16
Uh-huh

#s23
Uh-huh

#s25
Yeah

#s28
Uh-huh

#s31
Yeah

#s32
I certainly do n't uh advocate turning people like that loose

#s34
I 'm not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail

#s35
but uh

#s39
Yeah

#s40
That that 's a factor

#s49
Right

#s53
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s56
Yeah

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Well I

#s59
the cost is something

#s60
but it 's but I think it 's relatively unimportant compared to what 's the most effective way of dealing with crime

#s61
and I guess I would like

#s62
I do n't know

#s63
the European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment

#s64
and they they do n't have a crime problem either

#s66
No

#s67
you ca n't

#s68
they do n't execute anybody in Britain or France

#s69
and I do n't believe they do in Germany or Italy either

#s70
and they do n't have the crime problems we do

#s71
I do n't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two

#s73
I guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when I see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty I think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing

#s74
and the that that bothers me

#s76
But it

#s77
but uh

#s80
Huh

#s83
Yeah

#s85
Huh

#s88
Well actually I wha-

#s89
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I do n't really think it uh I do n't really think it 's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else

#s90
I think it just becomes a uh symbolic I 'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians

#s91
so

#s93
I would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh

#s95
Like I said some years ago I think I would have said there 's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country

#s97
Now I 'm I 'm not so sure of that

#s98
I 'm I I would n't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around

#s100
Uh I guess I 'm I 'm

#s101
my view of uh

#s102
my

#s103
I 'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh that uh uh costs and other factors justify uh uh executing people

#s105
Maybe it 's more a symbolic gesture that uh uh than anything else

#s106
and uh I 've also never been a victim although I have some I have two friends whose wives were murdered

#s107
and uh I can imagine that uh uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
