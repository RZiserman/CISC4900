Well uh does the company you work for test for drugs

#s5
Huh

#s7
Uh no

#s8
we 're not being tested for drugs at all

#s9
uh our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or its reasons for immediate dismissal

#s11
it says use of narcotics on company premises

#s13
So that 's pretty general

#s14
but uh I work for an environmental management firm

#s16
and I 'm an engineer there

#s17
but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites

#s18
but I do n't operate any machinery

#s20
Now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a a medical monitoring program

#s22
because they 're at a higher risk of exposure

#s23
and blood screening is part of that

#s24
and I I think that drugs

#s25
they do test for drugs in that capacity

#s26
but it 's not their exclusive

#s27
it 's just part it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for

#s29
But I think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field

#s30
What is the nature of your company 's business

#s38
Um

#s48
Oh really

#s54
Right

#s56
We that 's been an a an issue uh in our company even though we do n't have the random or even regular drug screening

#s57
In fact they 'll have these little parties

#s58
and people will just get

#s59
I mean I 've

#s60
my brother lives where I work

#s61
and I have many a time called him to come get me you know

#s62
And uh uh but y- you know they do n't think twice about serving beer by the keg You know

#s64
but uh I think drug testing

#s65
and I I do n't know

#s66
I guess I k- I think it 's got some relevance

#s67
but I think its relevance is pretty limited

#s68
I mean I think you know

#s69
in your case I do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing

#s71
I think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident

#s85
Uh-huh

#s100
Oh

#s101
Right
