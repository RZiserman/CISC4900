#s1
So who 's your favorite team

#s3
Pittsburgh

#s5
I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little

#s8
Oh really

#s10
Huh

#s11
That 's pretty nice

#s12
Yeah

#s13
that 's good

#s14
I I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain or steel curtain

#s17
Huh

#s18
Well last year it was Buffalo

#s19
and I I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just they just impressed me as being so efficient

#s20
and they never score

#s21
They never blow out their opponents

#s22
They just score just enough points

#s24
and that really impressed me

#s25
But then down here I li-

#s26
MUMBLEx is pretty close to New Orleans

#s27
and I 've been keeping up with the Saints a lot

#s29
Yeah

#s30
the Saints are starting to impress me this year you know a lot

#s33
This it they are really

#s34
Did you see the game Sunday night or Sunday afternoon

#s37
It was funny

#s38
There were they ha- uh a fireworks display at halftime

#s40
Yeah

#s41
and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire

#s43
So they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire

#s45
Those big piece of something came flaming falling out of the roof and landed on the field

#s46
so there 's this big fire on the field

#s47
and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything

#s49
It was funn-

#s50
I mean you just really ca n't tell what 's going to happen

#s52
I know

#s53
It 's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints

#s55
And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal

#s57
And it it was beautiful right down the middle

#s61
He is

#s62
Yes

#s64
Uh I s- I sure hope so

#s65
I 'm not sure I 'm not sure who they play

#s66
Right now I 've got it narrowed down to the top four teams

#s68
It 's pretty much going between Washington They are undefeated And uh Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice

#s70
and one of those was to Buffalo

#s71
And they beat the Saints

#s72
Their only time they lost

#s74
Houston

#s75
I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Uh from what I saw they were playing

#s79
when I was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers

#s81
and from what I saw the game Houston Houston impressed me a lot

#s83
But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night

#s84
and if that was an off night I 'd hate to see when he 's on a good night

#s87
He 's

#s88
Yeah

#s89
the their their backfield is really impressive

#s90
Haywood Jeffreys and Drew Hill and Allen MUMBLEx

#s92
they really impress me

#s94
That 's right

#s95
Who who did they play

#s97
Dallas

#s98
that 's right

#s100
all because

#s101
That 's right

#s102
I remember that now

#s106
Do you have a favorite between those two

#s108
Really

#s112
Well that 's true

#s113
MUMBLEx

#s114
I hate to say it

#s115
but I hate Dallas

#s118
Yeah

#s120
Yeah

#s121
I imagine

#s122
That 's the way

#s123
I 've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two

#s124
and they they 've actually started doing something

#s127
So I 've actually pl- paid attention to them

#s129
Well do you know anything about the expansion teams they 're thinking about bringing in

#s131
Really

#s133
Uh right now I think this Memphis they 're they 're trying to get the teams

#s135
And that 's that 's where I was when I saw uh Houston play

#s137
Saint Louis is trying to get a team

#s138
Uh Baltimore is trying to get a team

#s139
and there 's some other city

#s140
I 'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham

#s141
but I 'm not sure

#s144
Think so

#s146
Uh-huh

#s147
Because I know they 've got a MUMBLEx football team

#s148
but I think it might be them

#s151
I would definitely

#s152
I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after

#s153
And right now I think Memphis and it 's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it

#s155
Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis

#s156
and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did

#s158
Yeah

#s159
It 's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two
