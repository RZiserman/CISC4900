#s1
Uh I think uh

#s2
actually I 'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation

#s3
And for me there 's absolutely no question what 's the most important benefit

#s5
I think it 's health care

#s6
It 's what

#s7
I think everybody would say that

#s9
Right

#s10
Belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you

#s12
Uh so- the uh

#s13
sometimes I think it 's more important than salary

#s15
Yes

#s16
And uh I do n't know if I would rank that second

#s17
but uh since I have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important

#s18
Yeah

#s19
you know

#s21
in a in a given year dental ca- dental expenses can really kill you

#s26
Right

#s28
Right

#s29
It 's uh

#s31
Right

#s32
uh and then uh uh if the cleaning does n't get you the orthodony will

#s35
Uh I guess that would be up there

#s36
Uh I 'm not sure if I would rank uh how I would rank that next to say compared to retirement

#s37
or uh uh uh pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great a great benefit MUMBLEx

#s40
And I I think it 's really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how we 're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan

#s41
Uh

#s44
Right

#s45
When you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive

#s46
and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you would n't otherwise do

#s48
and

#s51
Leave

#s54
You know I I do n't think so yet

#s55
They may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take

#s57
Uh I their uh I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short Uh

#s59
uh uh I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks

#s61
Right

#s62
and uh

#s65
There

#s66
There ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time

#s70
It 's uh it 's so important to families then

#s71
and uh and yet anybody who 's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up

#s73
Uh

#s75
That

#s77
Yeah

#s78
you 're right

#s79
I think you 've put your finger on the one benefit that I that I would most like to see uh changed Uh the uh parental leave

#s85
Right

#s90
Right

#s91
They do it by shortchanging their kids

#s92
There 's no other way I mean uh unless they 're part of some extended family which is unlikely

#s93
Uh

#s97
MUMBLEx people moving as much

#s98
And uh they just it 's just a terrible choice

#s99
you should n't have to make it

#s101
Uh you 're right

#s102
And uh

#s104
Oh right

#s105
Boy

#s106
would I like to have that

#s108
Yeah

#s111
Oh listen

#s112
I have friends in a lot of different cities

#s113
If you just fly me there I 'll take care of that

#s117
Right

#s118
So and uh I guess the
