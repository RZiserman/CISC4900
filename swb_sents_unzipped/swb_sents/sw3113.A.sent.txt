#s2
Okay

#s3
Well I uh I guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers I 'm not a lawyer uh that I find a lot of things are so specialized that I 'm not sure

#s4
and I I look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to uh uh

#s5
they can find guilt or innocence

#s7
uh but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that

#s13
Uh-huh

#s14
Yeah

#s15
Because I find that uh

#s16
I 've been on a few juries

#s17
and uh as a say I I tend to be around uh civil cases because I 've been an expert witness some

#s18
and uh many matters are so complicated that it 's so hard to uh come up with the fair value uh or the fair sentence

#s19
and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime

#s21
Uh that uh

#s22
when I only do something one two or three times I 'm hardly an expert on it

#s23
and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three

#s26
And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a you know worth five years or twenty-five

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Yeah

#s37
Uh-huh

#s38
Yeah

#s41
Uh-huh

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Well one of the others things that gets me on on the juries is that often in the newspaper I I tend to hear two things that well that go on

#s49
One is you often see in the headlines the big numbers

#s51
Uh and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed by a judge or an Appeals Court

#s53
and that never makes the the press

#s54
and so when uh you or I as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what 's what because we see the headlines uh

#s55
and we do n't have a- again a lot of knowledge

#s56
so we do n't know what is really going on what is uh really the range of sentences or awards that are uh are actually uh in the end applied

#s61
Uh-huh

#s66
Uh-huh

#s72
Yeah

#s74
Well that 's where uh the role of juries is is restricted

#s75
and I 'm not sure I 'd want to change that aspect of it

#s76
one is it 's restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know

#s78
if it 's first degree rape second deg- degree rape or whatever they only get to decide on that

#s79
well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape uh

#s80
and you can decide guilt or innocence on that

#s82
Uh such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it 's uh premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees

#s83
The other thing that juries are restricted on and and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my even in my own experiences that you usually do n't get to hear all the information

#s85
It 's what information is presented

#s86
and uh I do n't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards

#s87
but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence

#s90
Uh-huh

#s92
Yeah

#s93
and the truth that 's brought out is uh as I say when I 've heard about you know

#s95
the oath is to tell the truth

#s96
the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want uh

#s97
they do n't want uh the whole truth

#s98
I mean you can say

#s100
yeah

#s102
The

#s103
because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the of the truth
