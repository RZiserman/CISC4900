#s3
Okay

#s4
so we 're going to talk about uh what kind of clothes we wear while we work

#s6
Do you work for T I

#s9
Oh you do

#s10
well you 're like me then

#s11
I stay home also

#s13
Yes

#s14
I have two a seven year old and three and a half year old

#s16
How about you

#s18
Oh

#s20
Oh my you are busy

#s22
and they 're all girls

#s23
I have two girls

#s24
so all girls around here

#s26
Yes

#s27
uh really sweet

#s29
That 's how I am too

#s31
Uh-huh

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
Oh that 's funny

#s38
Yeah

#s40
Yeah

#s41
Yeah

#s42
I know that 's kind of how I am

#s43
I said who ever I talk to is going to be board because when it 's summer time I 'm wearing shorts

#s44
and when it 's cold I 'm wearing sweat pants and most of unless I 'm going to something special that my daughter 's doing or something like that

#s48
Well that 's that 's good

#s49
I used to wear jeans all the time until after I had kids

#s50
and now nothing seems to be comfortable because I bulge in all the wrong places

#s51
so

#s54
Yeah

#s57
Right

#s58
yeah

#s62
Yeah

#s63
yeah

#s64
I know what you mean

#s65
Well

#s69
Oh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
Right

#s72
Uh-huh

#s73
That 's right

#s75
One of my daughters was born in June

#s76
and I remember I wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time

#s79
And I had one that was born in December

#s80
so um it was a little bit because it was a real warm winter

#s82
so even even into like November and December I was still wearing the short sleeve dresses

#s83
course I 'm always hot when I 'm pregnant too

#s84
so

#s87
I I did n't really need warm clothes

#s88
but I really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new uh units outfits you know that are just knit

#s90
Oh they are so comfortable

#s92
It 's it 's just um you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff

#s94
and it 's just great because you can put you know you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want

#s96
or you can just wear them with you know tennis shoes if you want

#s97
So they 're really nice

#s98
and I 've enjoyed wearing those

#s100
but I

#s103
Yeah

#s104
well I do n't either

#s105
if we if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference

#s107
I worked part time when my oldest was a baby

#s109
and um I had to wear a dress every day

#s110
and and it was a little bit hard to uh wind down

#s113
I would I would have to drive six thirty five home

#s114
and I would be burning up like in the summer time

#s116
by the time I got home I was like Oh I 've got to get out of these clothes

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
Right

#s122
Right

#s124
Yeah

#s125
Yeah

#s127
Yeah

#s128
and then when you drive home like especially if you 're in a lot of traffic which you are in Dallas

#s130
uh-huh

#s132
because I always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time

#s134
I was afraid I 'd make the car overheat

#s136
Yeah

#s137
so I would roll my windows down

#s138
it was still a hundred degrees

#s140
and I would just be sweltering hot by the time I picked my daughter up

#s141
and um I had a friend who used to take shorts to work

#s143
and after work she 'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes

#s145
and I thought that 's probably a good idea because you really

#s148
yeah

#s149
because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you especially if it 's something that has to be dry cleaned which I do n't have any of

#s153
No

#s154
when you have children you do n't

#s155
um even when I go to church I have to have something I can just throw in the washer when I 'm through

#s158
That 's right

#s159
or if you get it dirty or whatever

#s160
I know it

#s162
Me too

#s164
I know

#s165
that 's how I am too

#s167
Right

#s168
me neither

#s169
I have
