#s2
Well um done a little uh repair on the uh shingles on the roof recently

#s3
We 've had a lot of wind around here

#s5
Yes

#s6
It looks like I 'm going to have to get up there again because we may have a leak

#s8
We 've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio

#s9
but uh well I 'm right

#s10
Plano 's just north of Dallas

#s12
and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now I guess

#s13
I saw on the news

#s16
Well we 're up uh we 're north and uh oh about uh I do n't know uh eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line I guess

#s21
Uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday

#s22
So far we have n't had any today

#s23
And uh I suppose that means I should be uh getting up there to look at that uh shingle

#s24
but uh I had something else planned today

#s26
so I guess I 'll let it go awhile

#s30
They 're uh

#s31
no

#s32
they 're uh wood shake

#s35
Yeah

#s37
No

#s38
I

#s39
uh as a matter of fact we 've never had a leak actually yet

#s40
Now this

#s41
we just bought the house last year

#s42
and uh uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles

#s43
So I 've just recently had to start looking at it myself

#s45
So it 's a small problem so far

#s46
but I guess you just have to keep on top of it

#s47
What kind of roof do you have

#s50
Oh then you do n't have to do too much with it

#s53
Uh-huh

#s56
Oh it 's pretty steep

#s57
Uh parts of it are steeper than others

#s59
Well uh you wear uh shoes with good traction and and and try to remember where you are at all times

#s63
And remember to yell Geronimo if all else fails

#s70
It 's actually just twelve years old now

#s72
Yeah

#s73
it uh

#s74
this part of the country actually they say that when the house is uh fifteen it 's already old

#s75
but just take good care of it

#s77
Thing is we 've uh the main thing that we 've had with this house recently has been some uh squirming I call it of the foundation

#s78
We 're just on a concrete slab you know

#s80
but uh the soil right under this is a clay

#s81
and it uh

#s83
Well it uh depending on its moisture content it either swells up or shrinks

#s84
and uh of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer

#s87
and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from uh from uh drooping

#s89
and uh but anytime there 's a change in the weather like the temperature drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors

#s91
Well usually what you do is just wait until you think it 's stopped

#s92
and then you patch them up

#s96
Uh well this is all uh it 's all drywall

#s98
uh I think with uh

#s100
yeah

#s101
right

#s103
But uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks

#s104
I do n't know quite how that works

#s105
Maybe it is n't drywall

#s106
I do n't really know

#s108
Yeah

#s109
I think it is

#s112
I expect that 's what it is

#s113
yeah

#s115
Yeah

#s116
I think that 's the way this is done

#s117
Fortunately we have n't had any real big holes in it yet

#s118
so I

#s124
Yes

#s125
well the previous owner had a major problem with it because uh oh probably a variety of things

#s126
His neighbor used
