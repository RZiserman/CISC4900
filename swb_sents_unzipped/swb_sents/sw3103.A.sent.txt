#s1
Okay

#s7
Yes

#s9
Uh-huh

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s18
Right

#s20
Oh mercy

#s27
Yeah

#s28
that that 's too bad

#s33
Um um that 's sad

#s34
It really is

#s37
Uh-huh

#s40
Uh-huh

#s43
That 's that 's wonderful

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Well that 's wonderful

#s50
That speaks well of your mother

#s53
She had high standards

#s55
Yeah

#s57
Oh bless her heart

#s61
Challenges

#s63
Uh-huh

#s65
Right

#s67
Uh-huh

#s72
Uh-

#s73
uh-huh

#s75
Surely

#s79
Well I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie

#s80
And I can uh relate to that uh

#s82
uh I think it 's it 's the image that the woman has and uh in the world as uh the lesser of the two

#s85
And uh I think things are changing

#s86
but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to like it to take

#s88
And uh I think we are progressing at a snail 's pace

#s90
but we are progressing

#s92
So that 's the main point is that we are going ahead

#s94
And uh I think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve

#s96
And uh men uh have a lot of them have uh come around and have seen the error of their ways

#s99
But there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change

#s101
So we have to uh face that reality also

#s106
It could be if they are af- they are not sure of themselves

#s108
The ones that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves

#s110
And they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level

#s112
And they do not have any uh ego uh problems that they are fighting

#s115
And uh I think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term

#s119
Uh and I what I would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes uh we each have our uh jobs in life and that we should recognize that And that we should support each other

#s124
And uh I think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal

#s128
Uh-huh

#s138
Uh Uh-huh

#s144
uh-huh

#s150
Well I guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us

#s152
And uh the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands

#s154
And I believe that strongly

#s156
And uh but I think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is

#s158
And I think the issue should be settled before there 's a conflict

#s160
Uh and I think that can happen in a very won- wonderful way

#s162
And if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves

#s164
Can you picture that

#s166
I mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself

#s171
And uh that 's really the the divine answer and and the right answer

#s174
So uh uh that would be a beautiful relationship

#s177
And I think there are some people that have done that

#s179
and I have seen it

#s181
And it 's it 's just marvelous

#s182
and I am just in awe to see this
