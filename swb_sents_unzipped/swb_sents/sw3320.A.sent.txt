#s1
We 're supposed to talk about crime in the city

#s3
And uh seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays does n't it

#s10
Well it is

#s11
but our crimes up here uh as I think it must be in most cities now

#s12
but uh I was listening to the news the other day

#s13
and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because of the uh so many people are without work nowadays

#s14
economy 's so bad

#s18
That 's a good point

#s19
That 's just what they quoted over the news

#s21
I do n't know if I believe that or not

#s22
but it it does seem up

#s23
and

#s25
What kind

#s27
Well we got a I think we got a pretty good newspaper

#s28
Uh we have two the MORNING NEWS and the uh TIMES HERALD

#s30
MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation

#s31
I think it 's a pretty good

#s32
it 's a locally owned paper

#s34
The HERALD is owned I think by the TIMES out of uh L A or somewhere

#s36
But

#s39
Well they do n't

#s40
no

#s41
not really

#s42
uh they do n't play it up I do n't think

#s43
Uh but there there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into

#s46
We had our our

#s47
fact about uh

#s48
last year sometime our home was broken into

#s50
We

#s52
Yeah

#s53
we uh uh

#s54
I did n't think ours ever would be burgled into burgled

#s55
but so many in our neighborhood had been

#s56
and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main street

#s59
But uh we were so uh

#s62
Sort of yeah

#s63
And I never did get a security system

#s64
but since that happened I certainly have

#s67
It 's uh uh I guess excuse me just a standard

#s68
Uh with the uh all the doors and the uh infrared thing you know motion detector

#s70
Pre- Pretty standard

#s72
Yes

#s73
yes

#s74
It 's monitored and all that

#s76
And

#s79
I think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice

#s81
I really do

#s82
But uh this deal that was part of it for you know three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever

#s85
And uh but it uh

#s86
the monitoring is not that bad though

#s87
because uh uh we 've goofed it up you know

#s88
several times you 'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something

#s89
and and they call back pretty quickly

#s90
so I guess it 's you know I think it 's all right

#s91
But I

#s92
to answer your question I think uh uh I think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself

#s94
whether it

#s96
Uh-huh

#s98
Well it 's got a back up system that does n't work supposedly Tha- uh that if it 's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway

#s99
Supposedly

#s101
Who knows you know

#s102
But that 's a selling point

#s103
And I think they 're probably I think it probably does these things or sur- supposedly pretty good

#s105
Boy they sure advertise them you know so many of them nowadays

#s107
But uh well do n't do n't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there

#s110
I 'm not saying it 's any higher than anybody else 's

#s111
Down here we seem to

#s112
or or not here

#s113
but the statistics seem to say that

#s114
I do n't know

#s116
Is that right

#s118
I would gather probably from drugs

#s120
And I think that 's the reason it 's so high everywhere

#s122
But I do n't think there 's anyplace

#s123
used to

#s124
years ago you thought well these little small cities and all would n't have that problem

#s125
but they do

#s127
We 've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know

#s129
That 's a good question

#s130
I do n't know

#s131
I do n't know what the solution is

#s132
I really do n't

#s134
Yeah

#s136
Yep

#s137
Th-

#s138
and nothing seems to change

#s139
And uh I 'm not sure that anything will because these if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it

#s141
uh but they want to buy it

#s142
so

#s144
Supply and demand

#s145
Long as somebody wants to buy it somebody going to provide it for them

#s146
So I do n't know I do n't you know I do n't know what the solution is

#s147
I really do n't

#s149
I do n't think anyone does in fact
