#s1
Well Hal what 's uh what 's crime like in Dallas

#s3
Uh-huh

#s5
Yeah

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
Oh yeah

#s11
Yeah

#s12
in Baltimore we have similar

#s13
Uh I live on the outskirts of Baltimore

#s14
and uh we live right outside the city

#s15
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though I 'm in graduate school uh

#s16
I live here because it 's close to the university

#s18
But you know we have uh

#s19
it it 's really funny

#s20
the only crime we really see is uh just the kids being malicious

#s22
You know and I think most of that is because their parents are n't around

#s23
That make sense

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Yeah

#s28
something like that

#s29
No one 's you know

#s30
or or fathers are just missing you know

#s31
so there 's no uh no consistency there in the home or whatever

#s32
There 's no one to tell them what 's right and what 's wrong you know

#s36
Uh-huh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s43
Yeah

#s46
Uh-huh

#s47
Yeah

#s48
Yeah

#s49
I think that 's we 're about the same in Baltimore

#s50
Though uh Washington I think is uh close by

#s51
and you know they experience a lot more

#s53
I think they definitely have more problems that uh in in the area

#s54
What what do you think can prevent crime

#s57
Uh-huh

#s59
Yeah

#s61
Yeah

#s64
Uh-huh

#s66
Uh-huh

#s67
Yeah

#s68
Yeah

#s69
I think Uh-huh

#s70
Yeah

#s71
I I I think I agree with you there

#s73
Uh-huh

#s76
Uh-huh

#s77
Yeah

#s78
I think they the drug culture definitely has uh is one of the main problems

#s79
Yeah

#s80
our uh our mayor in uh Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should uh legalize drugs Because it would eliminate the uh the violence and the uh the under- the the market I guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it

#s83
That make sense

#s84
He 's one of the big proponents of that

#s85
He gets on national television and and says that you know

#s86
So it 's uh

#s87
and he was a d- d- a District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor

#s88
So that 's a really stran-

#s89
you know it 's a different viewpoint

#s90
I uh

#s92
Yeah

#s95
Uh-huh

#s97
What happens if we lose worse

#s101
Right

#s104
Uh-huh

#s106
Right

#s107
yeah

#s109
Yeah

#s110
they have induced it themselves

#s112
Yeah

#s113
that 's true

#s116
Uh-huh

#s117
Uh-huh

#s118
Well I think you know they did that in Alaska That that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana

#s120
But I never I never heard results or anything like that

#s121
so I never you know

#s122
plus that 's such a that 's not a true uh you know it really could n't be a good test because Alaska 's so different than every other part of the country

#s124
You know so that but that was interesting you know

#s125
I I do n't

#s126
crime is one of those things that 's uh

#s127
I I do n't know you know

#s128
the drug culture

#s129
the uh the uh you know

#s130
I I see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it

#s134
Yeah

#s137
Uh-huh

#s139
Yeah

#s140
that 's true

#s141
That 's true

#s142
We worked hard for everything

#s143
That 's very true

#s145
Uh-huh

#s150
Uh-huh

#s152
Uh-huh

#s153
Yeah

#s158
Right

#s161
Uh-huh

#s164
Yeah

#s165
Yeah

#s166
That I think that uh the drunk driving has just actually just caught on

#s167
Uh A- and I I I really uh

#s169
my father was hit by a drunk driver when I was in high school

#s171
and uh that was a very uh that that was an awful three years afterwards You know of recovery and the difficulties and uh everything we did

#s173
and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago

#s175
there was no

#s176
his father was even the uh police chief of the town

#s178
So there was no repercussion at all You know other than insurance

#s179
but he was uninsured

#s181
So uh our insurance paid for everything

#s182
but it was a very difficult time

#s183
and and then later this was actually funny my brother and I were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car

#s184
and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere

#s186
and they came and questioned us

#s188
You know and

#s190
Right

#s191
Uh-huh

#s192
Yep Uh-huh

#s194
Yeah

#s195
very much so

#s196
Yeah

#s197
that those are some important points

#s198
Yeah

#s199
I

#s200
that 's those are

#s202
Well see Maryland is one of the most

#s203
we just voted in uh gun control strong gun control here in the state of Maryland

#s204
I I think
