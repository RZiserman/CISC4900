You bet

#s2
They tell you our topic

#s4
You 've got it

#s6
Yes

#s7
we do

#s8
Uh my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old

#s9
and we have a a cat which is uh I guess about five years old

#s11
How about you guys

#s13
Three dogs

#s14
And two bi-

#s15
what kind of birds do you have

#s17
No kidding

#s18
En- enjoy them

#s20
You let them out and let them fly around and everything

#s23
Okay

#s25
You-

#s26
You know this is like a cruelty joke

#s27
and I apologize if you 're a bird lover

#s28
but uh we had a parakeet And my fault put up our first electric fan And never thought about it

#s31
Knocked that parakeet right out of the air

#s39
It killed him

#s42
Oh that 's

#s43
well it killed ours

#s44
I 'll be darned

#s49
Well speaking of pets I 'll tell you my my kids are older now my both of them are either in or out of college

#s50
but but we had for years about five years I guess had a my son had a Burmese boa constrictor

#s51
and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in in length

#s54
and finally my wife wife bless her heart got rid of it because I did n't really like it

#s55
We also had a

#s56
one year down in Florida on a vacation for Father 's Day my kids years ago maybe uh ten years ago go bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop

#s57
It 'd be like it 'd been like deactivated as far as s- s- smell and everything

#s59
and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years

#s60
and and my son left went to school

#s61
we finally sold his boa constrictor

#s62
but my son needed some money

#s63
and we we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars

#s65
So when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk

#s66
so I made him a deal

#s67
I said You take that skunk

#s68
and he said I 'll sell that snake to you for two fifty

#s69
I said otherwise I 'm going to give it to this other man

#s70
So he took the skunk too

#s71
And the skunk was a good a decent pet but you know does his little jobbies in the litter box and is

#s73
And it was sort of a neat

#s74
but they just stink too much

#s77
That was sort of fun you know

#s78
I tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover

#s79
I use to visualize my wife MUMBLEx

#s80
many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa

#s81
and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body and with his with his head right on her neck

#s84
and the skunk would be sitting at her feet

#s85
but the cat would be on the back of the sofa

#s86
and a dog would be running around crazy

#s93
Oh gosh

#s94
Oh my son bought this snake uh

#s95
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school

#s96
and it was just a small thing then

#s97
but it got to be pretty big

#s98
and you know you 'd feed it you 'd feed it you put feed him small mice to big rats and things like that

#s100
it 's just uh too much

#s101
That snake used to watch our cat walk around

#s102
I always told my wife I says you know your friend 's going to get our cat one of these days

#s107
Oh me neither

#s109
We 're down to a simple dog and cat now

#s110
and that 's the way it should be

#s111
and

#s113
Have n't had any parakeets for quite a while

#s114
birds

#s115
Uh customer of mine has a parrot

#s116
and uh gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot

#s117
and that was just mind boggling

#s123
Are you

#s125
Uh-huh

#s128
Yes

#s133
Oh gosh

#s136
That 's neat

#s139
Why sure

#s144
Come to my menagerie
