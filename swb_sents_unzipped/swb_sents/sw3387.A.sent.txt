#s1
Well I do n't know what to do about the federal budget

#s2
Um there certainly have been ideas surfaced uh recently uh matter of fact repeatedly by many people

#s3
and I sort of wondered what your what thoughts you had on that area

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
Now are you are you talking about the elected people

#s8
or are you talking about others

#s12
Uh-huh

#s14
Yes

#s15
Uh-huh

#s18
I 'm not sure how you would ach-

#s19
how would you achieve that

#s20
I mean if

#s22
So you would trust the decision making economists

#s24
Sometimes called the dismal science

#s27
Uh-huh

#s28
Yes

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
Yes

#s38
Yes

#s39
Uh-huh

#s41
Right

#s42
So so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists

#s43
I mean right now lobbyists require to register

#s44
you 'd just say Ma- make them all

#s49
No causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for

#s51
Uh-huh

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
Yeah

#s57
Uh-huh

#s59
So uh you talk about jeopardizing the future

#s60
Would you be against any deficit spending

#s64
Uh-huh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s68
Yeah

#s72
Uh-huh

#s74
But wha- what practical steps could on- could one take

#s75
Um

#s77
Well but everybody will say that he is for that

#s78
Uh

#s79
and and how will you make that actually happen

#s85
Uh-huh

#s87
Uh-huh

#s89
Yep

#s90
Sounds like a good idea

#s92
Nothing escapes right

#s93
No no deductions nothing

#s97
Just ten percent

#s99
Yep

#s102
Right

#s106
Yep

#s107
So that that 's it

#s108
That 's

#s109
I mean I I agree with that

#s110
that 's a good idea

#s111
and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or or lower them or what
