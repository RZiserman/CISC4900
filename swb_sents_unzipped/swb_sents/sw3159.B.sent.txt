When when I had my magazines at home I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures you know

#s41
and if something caught my eye then I might read something

#s43
but otherwise than that you know they were uh you know not too useful to me You know

#s45
I got some good recipes from them sometimes

#s46

And I have to read the magazines you know such as BYTE and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these uh magazines such as that

#s65
