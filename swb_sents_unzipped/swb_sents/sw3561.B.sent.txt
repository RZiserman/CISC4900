#s1
All right

#s2
well

#s4
Right

#s5
Uh are you saying you do n't think anything should be done in the short term

#s7
Yeah

#s8
I I think that you 're absolutely right there

#s9
The other thing is is that we 've got these um these all these bank defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh uh

#s11
Right

#s12
Exactly

#s13
Um

#s15
Exactly

#s16
and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem that 's going to continue to be with us for a while to come

#s17
Um I 'm not really uh sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if they 're talking about reducing uh the tax that needs to be paid or the tax that 's currently being paid then that ca n't it seems to me it ca n't possibly you know help with the the deficit picture

#s19
Yeah

#s20
exactly

#s22
Yeah

#s23
exactly

#s25
Yeah

#s26
it see- seems like it 's it 's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two

#s27
I mean it 's it 's the um

#s28
my understanding is what they 're try- what what supposedly they 're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes they 'll have more money to spend uh

#s29
and if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity uh which in turn will generate revenue

#s30
But it it seems like like uh it 's sort of a uh a sp- an unending spiral

#s31
and it it it uh

#s32
I 'm I 'm not sure that there 's any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend

#s33
And uh

#s37
Yeah

#s38
it uh it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do

#s40
Uh-huh

#s41
Uh-huh

#s42
I think that 's been a positive development

#s43
I think what that 's done is it 's it 's it 's help keep inflation from um uh

#s45
Yeah

#s46
exactly

#s48
It 's a sort of a piece of luck

#s50
Yeah um

#s51
I do n't know

#s52
what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term

#s55
Sure

#s59
Uh-huh

#s62
Right

#s63
I think that I think that that I agree with you certainly in the second situation

#s64
and I think certain entitlements I I 'm inclined to agree with you too

#s65
Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um uh

#s67
Uh-huh

#s69
Oh I see I see what you 're saying

#s70
And then they and then the people default on the loans

#s73
Well I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around uh

#s74
and I I I ca n't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing

#s75
but but taking what you 're saying at face value then I would have to agree with completely
