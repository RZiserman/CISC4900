#s1
Yes

#s2
Um I guess my initial view is our tax burden has n't gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts

#s4
but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in in the world

#s5
and in MUMBLEx

#s6
of the matter

#s7
you get what you pay for

#s8
if we 're going to have national health insurance which seems likely it 's necessarily going to involve more taxes

#s9
Uh I suspect I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that 's the direction we should look

#s15
Where 's it all going

#s20
Well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into into a big trust fund

#s22
but that is a particularly regressive tax uh

#s23
it 's a tax on the first dollar earnings

#s24
and Senator Moynihan 's uh proposal to to to cut there I think wou- makes a lot of sense

#s27
I think Senator Moynihan 's proposal to to cut the social security tax which is n't really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense

#s35
Uh-huh

#s38
Oh yeah

#s39
I think Japan I think Japan is probably about equal to ours

#s41
and other major countries are higher

#s42
Our friends were amazed that the sales taxes the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago

#s44
And as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services

#s45
and it 's a real real

#s47
they 're they 're real trade-offs there

#s52
Uh I

#s53
that 's that 's a scary thing that there 's no no real knowing about

#s54
Uh the the there 's a lot of inflation risk that is n't taken care of in most private pension plans

#s60
No

#s61
I 'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Uh part of the Commerce Department Here in Gaithersburg Maryland

#s68
Well

#s69
well

#s70
I I I did n't pick it uh

#s72
I mean um I like I do n't really recall

#s73
I may have filled out on the on the form

#s74
but I I certainly certainly have the feeling I 've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before

#s78
Yes

#s79
yes

#s80
when you place a call topic is given to you

#s84
Oh you should try it

#s89
Uh many of the subjects are Uh taxes taxes especially

#s90
Um one thing that has kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the is the level of def- of the defense budget

#s92
and that 's that same subject
