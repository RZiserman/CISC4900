#s4
Yeah

#s5
one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from Or sources

#s7
That 's what I would think

#s11
Right

#s12
Yeah

#s13
I think the automobile definitely is an area and any any industry that burns you know

#s14
and then I do n't know about chemical pollution

#s15
I 'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air

#s16
I know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution

#s17
They have offices that are too well insulated

#s18
They found people are getting sick

#s20
but I do n't know if that affects outside

#s21
You know I I think seems to think seems to me that 's what they were asking about was outside

#s22
and the thing I can the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories

#s25
Yeah

#s27
Right

#s28
Yeah

#s29
that is well that 's destroying the ozone is n't it

#s33
Yeah

#s34
that 's wh-

#s35
It 's kind of scary

#s38
Yeah

#s40
I think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces

#s42
I think it will

#s45
Uh-huh

#s48
Right

#s51
Right

#s54
Yeah

#s55
In this area too since you know in Texas we 're so spread out

#s57
we have to drive so far

#s58
but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where it just uh it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts

#s59
but we 're even getting it here

#s60
We can drive into when we 've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas

#s61
and you can tell it in the mornings too

#s62
My husband likes to go out and jog

#s63
and there 's just a brown fog here

#s64
and we do n't even have any mountains that are holding it in

#s66
But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets

#s70
You do n't have to have mountains that are stopping it

#s72
And uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings

#s73
and uh so yeah

#s74
we can comment

#s75
and we did n't see this a few years ago

#s78
It was pretty clear here

#s81
Right

#s84
Uh-huh

#s85
Yeah

#s88
Yeah

#s93
Yeah

#s94
And it 's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that

#s95
It 's a lot of waste

#s96
but
