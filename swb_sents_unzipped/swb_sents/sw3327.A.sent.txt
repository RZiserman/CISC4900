Okay

#s2
is it Mike

#s4
Do you repair your own car

#s7
Well I tell you what

#s8
that 's y- count your blessings because uh it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves

#s15
Well that 's why I do n't do as much as I 'd like

#s18
Because they are I mean they 've got they 've gotten complicated have n't they

#s21
Uh-huh

#s22
Is that right

#s28
Yeah

#s29
I I agree

#s30
About all I ever

#s31
I never was too mechanically inclined

#s32
but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and

#s34
Course they do n't use uh points anymore

#s36
But Uh they do still use plugs

#s39
And uh now brakes I 've always done a lot of you know changing brakes

#s41
And I used to do I could always do the alternator you know and starter

#s43
I do n't anymore

#s44
but I have on a lot a lot of times

#s52
Uh-huh

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Uh-huh

#s59
It probably slipped loose did n't it

#s62
Uh-huh

#s64
Uh-huh

#s69
Um

#s71
Oh

#s77
Y-

#s78
well it really was n't quite s- as bad as you thought was it was it

#s83
Well it was a lot of money

#s84
but

#s89
You had to have the help did n't you

#s92
Yeah

#s93
Well do you still do much work on them then

#s101
Disposal is a problem

#s104
That 's true

#s106
That 's true

#s107
Right

#s108
that that

#s109
I 've I 've quit doing that myself

#s111
And but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know

#s114
And uh but it

#s115
but no

#s116
I guess i-

#s117
that

#s118
and the main reason that it 's it 's quick
