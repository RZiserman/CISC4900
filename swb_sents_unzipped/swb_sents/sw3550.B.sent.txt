#s2
All right

#s4
Well what kind of car would I want to buy

#s6
I do n't know

#s7
The question is I mean would I want to buy

#s8
or would I would I probably actually buy

#s9
May be two different things

#s11
If I had all the money I wanted then that 's whole different matter

#s12
No

#s13
in that case I 'd I 'd I do n't know

#s14
I I my dream car for years was a was a Porsche Turbo MUMBLEx

#s17
But uh I do n't know if I 'd want one of those now

#s19
Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me

#s21
But I maybe would buy a B M W Uh or or even a Volvo

#s24
I 've got a uh a Dodge Daytona

#s26
It 's actually the first car we ever bought new

#s31
Uh-huh

#s33
Uh-huh

#s34
yeah

#s35
me too

#s36
So what car do you drive

#s37
What is it

#s39
Uh-huh

#s40
we almost bought one of those

#s41
Do you like it

#s47
Uh-huh

#s50
Yeah

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s55
you get a little more control over when when it 's doing the things it 's doing

#s57
Yeah

#s58
Uh what what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars

#s61
To what

#s62
AVIS

#s64
Really

#s66
Huh

#s67
I guess

#s72
I see

#s73
Uh-huh

#s75
Right

#s77
You work for a big company then

#s79
T I

#s80
I see

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
Um

#s83
but yeah

#s84
I I uh I do n't know

#s85
I would probably if I were to buy a car mys- you know with the constraints of real money I probably would would go with something like you know like a Honda Accord

#s88
Maybe it would

#s89
one thing I I really liked about about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have uh this seven year warranty

#s91
Um and it really saved us some big money once

#s94
Yeah

#s95
they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time

#s97
and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars

#s98
and I had to pay twenty five for the

#s100
Yeah

#s101
it was

#s106
Well we we bought the extended the the extension

#s107
and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know I do n't know four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra

#s111
Yeah

#s112
we did

#s113
but you know we really debated at the beginning

#s114
and of course I 'm glad I did it

#s118
But um we still have we still have like you know coup- three years left on it

#s122
Oh no

#s124
Bumper

#s125
Oh

#s128
Well that was good

#s130
Are

#s132
Uh-huh

#s133
Um if you were if you were going to uh buy a new car would you buy another uh another Accord

#s135
Uh-huh

#s137
Uh-huh

#s139
Oh yeah

#s140

#s142


#
Uh-huh

#s151
Uh-huh

#s153
Right

#s155
Yeah

#s156
my sister drives one

#s157
She drives a uh I do n't know

#s158
is it Legend

#s160
it 's a

#s161
I 'm not certain

#s162
but she 's liked it

#s163
Um

#s165
But I I have I have never had

#s166
and we

#s167
in fact what I 'm driving right now

#s168
we bought a we only had one car for a long time

#s169
and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth four miles to work and back kind of thing

#s172
And so uh I bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know little car that I could care less about

#s175
MUMBLEx

#s177
Oh well it 's uh it 's worked

#s179
I mean that 's exactly what it is you know

#s180
it 's just a it 's a cheap little little car just to go you know run around town in

#s184
and uh It 's actually kind of fun to drive

#s185
I I

#s186
you know getting back in the Daytona now I almost do n't like it You know

#s188
it 's like too too mushy

#s189
and it you know it 's an automatic

#s191
and

#s193
it 's too

#s194
the steering

#s196
you know you feel like you 're in a boat or something you know

#s197
it 's kind of

#s200
Oh
