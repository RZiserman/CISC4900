Hello

#s3
Hi

#s6
Hi

#s7
My name is Lowell

#s8
and I live in Raleigh North Carolina

#s12
Go right ahead

#s23
I 'm I 'm single

#s24
and I I live in a town home here in Raleigh

#s26
and it 's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area

#s29
ther- we we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes

#s31
and at the time that I bought this one it was just a a much better arrangement for me personally

#s32
I 'm not home a lot

#s33
I travel a great deal with my job

#s35
and so it was easier to have a home that did n't exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance

#s43
It certainly is

#s45
Well if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if they 're not you can hear

#s46
I that 's the main thing when I was shopping for one

#s47
I wanted to make sure I could I could n't hear my neighbors

#s48
and that was

#s50
so I bought one that 's more like living in a

#s51
once you 're inside you do n't know you 're in a town home

#s53
It is

#s54
They 're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side

#s56
so you do n't actually hear anybody next door to you

#s60
Yes

#s61
definitely

#s69
Well we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who do n't want the heat of Florida but do n't want the heat of the the cold of the northeast

#s71
so they settle sort of in-between

#s77
Yes

#s79
as a matter of fact this is a uh this particular community that I live in is very wooded

#s81
It is nice

#s87
Uh we definitely have a lot of trees here

#s89
Yes

#s90
but fortunately the home owner 's association does all that

#s93
Yes

#s94
I do n't have to worry about that

#s95
and this is the time of year we 're starting to lose

#s96
they 're all falling now

#s105
Right

#s109
No

#s110
I do n't think so

#s114
It was good to speak with you too

#s117
Thank you

#s118
you too

#s120
Bye-bye
