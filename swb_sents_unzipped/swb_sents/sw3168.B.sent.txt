#s8
Yeah

#s9
Uh I do n't either

#s10
I uh I 've never

#s11
I do n't work

#s12
at home right now

#s13
I stay home with my children

#s14
Uh but my husband works

#s15
and they do have that at his place of employment

#s16
and neither of us have a problem with it

#s17
We 've

#s18
particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such

#s19
It 's uh it 's a scary thing to know that uh you just do n't know what people are doing uh before they go to work

#s21
So and the the advertisements on television lately have been so uh

#s22
there have been so many You know

#s23
there 's uh

#s25
just about like train tr- train wrecks and things like that that

#s26
I feel like

#s27
probably just for our own safety when we 're traveling and things that would be something I 'd like to know that 's going on

#s34
Um

#s37
Right

#s40
Uh-huh

#s43
Yeah

#s49
Yeah

#s50
Well it 's it 's unfortunate I think that everyone does n't have that opinion

#s51
Uh some people just uh I 've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that

#s52
but uh in the long run it seems to me it 's kind of like what they keep talking about the uh the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know

#s54
they feel that 's not fair and whatever

#s55
but you know those kind of things I 'd like to know myself

#s57
It would n't be

#s58
in my opinion

#s59
I I 've had a lot of dental work done

#s60
and the last dentist did n't even use gloves at all

#s61
so

#s63
that kind of

#s64
yeah

#s65
And uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me

#s69
Well you would think so

#s71
That is because well

#s72
and I worked for a dentist

#s73
and that 's uh you know

#s74
you you come in contact with a lot of of blood and things like that

#s75
and it 's real real dangerous

#s77
I I would think

#s78
but with all the accidents just with with uh everything happening with just

#s79
airlines just drive me crazy

#s80
People are afraid to fly now You know just because of they do n't know what their pilot 's been doing and and things like that

#s82
and

#s84
I do n't know

#s86
Uh-huh

#s95
Well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs and they can get them the help that they need As opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support And whatever

#s98
because a lot of people seems like would probably obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things

#s100
and too many people are just dying Particularly in our area

#s102
I do n't know what the crime is like where you are

#s103
but the crime rate here is just astronomical

#s112
Uh-huh

#s113
I just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these

#s114
I have two little very little children under two

#s116
and I got a piece of paper from from my husband 's office

#s117
it 's talking about these uh drug tattoos now that they have got

#s119
That look like it looks like a sticker

#s120
and it 's for kid
