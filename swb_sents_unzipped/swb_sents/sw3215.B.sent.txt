No

#s7
I 'm from Plano also

#s10
That 's right

#s16
Right

#s18
I just got back from Dayton

#s19
I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family

#s21
and the trees are changing color there

#s24
So that

#s25
as soon as we got out of the cloud cover

#s26
Of course it was n't sunny like it is here

#s27
It was real gray

#s29
but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and I saw all those trees it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall

#s31
I do n't complain weather wise though because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning

#s32
and the high was only fifty

#s33
and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon

#s35
so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies

#s37
That 's right

#s42
Yeah

#s44
We did that when we lived up in Michigan

#s45
We went up to the upper peninsula

#s46
and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure

#s47
And then on leaf weekends it was which is this time of the year it 's bumper to bumper traffic

#s48
people as

#s49
whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road

#s52
Yes

#s58
I think it is

#s59
and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and uh the first frost

#s61
everything just happened three weeks early this year

#s66
Just so we do n't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring

#s70
Well I 've only been here just a short time too

#s71
so I have n't been through any of those either

#s72
so I have in Michigan

#s73
but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow

#s74
and life goes on

#s76
So as I understand it here if there 's anything they 'll call off schools and and close businesses

#s79
Right

#s82
Right

#s83
the real definition of ice

#s85
I think so

#s87
It was nice talking with you

#s89
Okay

#s91
Okay

#s93
Bye
