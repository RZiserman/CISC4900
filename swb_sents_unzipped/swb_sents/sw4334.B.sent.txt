#s2
Uh well I do n't know exactly what 's hot down in Texas

#s3
I know what 's hot down here with me

#s4
so that 's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know

#s5
I do n't ever listen to the radio

#s6
and that 's usually what 's hot around here

#s7
so So what kind of music do you like

#s10
Folk music

#s13
Uh-huh

#s14
Well we 're on totally different wavelengths

#s16
I 'm more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know uh Van Halen that kind of thing

#s20
Uh I do n't listen to the radio at all

#s21
We live in a fairly small town

#s22
so uh classic rock for me is what I have which is like uh Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix

#s25
Uh

#s26
Yeah

#s31
Yeah

#s32
Yeah

#s34
Yeah

#s35
well they

#s37
Yeah

#s38
yeah

#s39
that does that 's something you do n't does n't even sound good loud really You know

#s41
You know definitely

#s42
Uh so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some I might know of

#s43
I do n't know any folk music at all

#s45
Yeah

#s46
oh yeah

#s47
here

#s49
Oh plenty

#s50
Way way more than I can stand down here

#s51
I I do n't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it

#s52
I

#s55
Yeah

#s56
yeah

#s57
that 's more even more commercialized for of country music

#s59
But uh it 's getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as I see it

#s60
Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses

#s61
so

#s64
Yeah

#s65
it 's it 's kind of strange that it 's getting as big as it is

#s66
Concert tours for country and western sings is it 's it 's quite quite odd

#s67
but uh I do n't know

#s68
it 's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays I think

#s69
It 's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know

#s72
Yeah

#s73
and that 's all it

#s75
Yeah

#s77
That 's what it

#s78
Yeah

#s79
that 's what what you say

#s80
and and then music is wrapped around now

#s81
Now it 's the other way around

#s85
No

#s86
no

#s87
they do n't have anything really important you want to hear

#s88
But you know it 's kind of odd

#s89
it 's like it does n't have to be good

#s90
it 's just who does it you know

#s92
You hear a you hear a Paula Abdul song

#s93
and you

#s94
and I think if somebody else were to play that you know they would n't they nobody everybody would think that 's lousy

#s95
but because she did it it 's supposed to be good you know

#s96
it comes to the point where it 's your name not what you do more than anything

#s98
Madonna can do anything

#s99
and it would be considered good because it 's Madonna you know

#s101
Madonna could start playing folk music

#s102
and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it

#s103
so it 's it 's it 's really backwards how things are working now

#s105
but

#s108
Yeah

#s109
exactly

#s110
So I do n't know I I do n't know that that 's I do n't think that 's a good thing at all

#s111
but that 's that 's what the point we 've reached

#s112
so I do n't know how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least

#s119
Yeah

#s121
Yeah

#s122
Yeah

#s123
that 's about how I am on popular music

#s124
I do n't you know you do n't I do n't know enough about it because I just listen

#s125
uh everything I listen to is what I buy not whatever they play on the radio

#s126
so

#s129
Uh I

#s130
yeah

#s131
I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time

#s132
I do n't really switch around to new things very often

#s134
It 's just it 's you know it 's way to hectic and too confusing

#s138
Uh

#s139
yeah

#s140
generally

#s141
or about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I have n't heard

#s143
and I listen to it that way

#s144
but as far as

#s145
yeah

#s146
I do n't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I 've heard it

#s150
Yeah

#s156
Yeah

#s158
Yeah

#s159
yeah

#s160
that 's definitely

#s161
I
