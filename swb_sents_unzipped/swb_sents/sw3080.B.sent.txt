#s2
I do

#s3
yes

#s4
I uh uh I guess it actually changes

#s5
I do a number of different things simply walking with my wife

#s8
and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle

#s9
Uh and then moving up I run in the mornings

#s11
not every morning it probably averages about two days a week

#s13
and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights which is n't I understand quite exercising

#s14
but it 's along the lines

#s16
How about yourself

#s18
Uh-huh

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
Uh-huh

#s30
Right

#s32
Right

#s35
That 's right

#s38
Right

#s39
So you look at it more as a task

#s42
Right

#s44
I see

#s47
Right

#s48
right

#s49
So I 'm thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself

#s53
and so it 's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise

#s55
My job at Texas Instruments I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that I do n't get any exercise doing that

#s57
and plus there 's a build up of stress

#s59
so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner

#s60
and I need to go out in the morning and run

#s61
or I 'll just get nuts

#s63
so that 's kind of a motivator

#s64
so even though I can look at it as a task the you know I kind of get the I get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying Well I 'm lowering my chance of heart attack and thus that type stuff

#s67
Sure

#s68
that all

#s69
I I do all that

#s74
Yeah

#s77
Right

#s80
Well it 's a

#s81
something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable

#s83
I do that at the end of the day

#s84
and it takes you know

#s85
that that during that time the stress from the day goes away

#s86
I get to share whatever I did with my wife and and vice versa

#s88
Going to the gym is is actually something different than than like

#s89
oh and the running

#s90
and I enjoy that too

#s92
Year

#s93
I 've been running since high school on track teams and the like

#s95
so running I I 'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you do n't feel your muscles any more

#s98
and you do n't think about the pain of it

#s99
You you you take the time to relax some how

#s100
and you think about other things

#s101
During those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you ca n't breathe and this and that

#s103
and that 's no fun

#s104
And it 's so hard to get past that for a lot of people

#s108
Yeah

#s109
the ex- the uh weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know

#s110
I think I look better

#s112
I have just a I do n't I 'm not a huge person

#s113
I 'm just a regular looking guy

#s114
but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife

#s115
and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is is attractive

#s118
so that pays also

#s120
Yeah

#s121
so so I guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice

#s123
I love her you know

#s124
I enjoy being with her

#s126
I guess that 's one thing

#s127
but also uh that that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles

#s132
Yeah

#s135
Oh yeah

#s136
I do n't I do n't let that bother me

#s137
but yeah

#s138
that 's something that comes with time too You know

#s140
I 'll tell you

#s141
the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know

#s143
it 's your own

#s144
you you 're you 're struggling against your own body weight

#s146
you can d- have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow

#s148
and you can actually get a good wo-

#s149
you can I know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups

#s154
Oh is that right

#s156
Right

#s157
Yeah

#s158
Right

#s160
That 's funny

#s162
Yeah

#s165
Yeah

#s167
Well may- you know maybe not

#s168
I 'd say I 'd say at twenty-two you do n't necessarily need a plan as long as you 're getting getting the exercise otherwise

#s170
When your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan

#s172
and what 's real funny about plans is that there 's a struggle between uh when you when you add something to your life when you add a plan to your life

#s173
something else has to go away

#s175
and that 's the hard decision is okay if I 'm going to run in the mornings what am I what do I trade it off for

#s176
Well the answer 's sleep right

#s178
If I 'm going to walk at night what do I trade it off for

#s179
Well Star Trek

#s181
or you know it it it 's always trade offs

#s182
and you actually have to as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to to to replace this thing

#s184
It 's I mean not just exercise but anything

#s185
It 's very hard

#s187
And uh I do n't I do n't think you should worry about not having a program yet

#s189
Yep

#s190
Yeah

#s191
I guess if you care or if your wife your future wife uh gives you a reason to care which helps

#s194
Well I think we covered it

#s197
Nice talking with you Craig

#s201
You too

#s202
Good day

#s204
Bye
