#s1
Uh I work at T I

#s2
and we have uh of course started drug testing uh random drug testing here

#s3
and uh I have n't gotten called yet

#s4
but uh I feel that it 's probably pre- it 's pretty good if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs

#s6
Uh I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I

#s7
but I think our latest sat- statistic said something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the dru- on on all the testing

#s10
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s20
Right

#s23
Right

#s27
Right

#s28
I

#s29
at T I if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you 're put on a program

#s30
and uh you know you go through the program

#s31
and then you 're called like six months after you complete the pro- program

#s33
and if you test positive then you 're terminated

#s37
Yeah

#s38
uh-huh

#s39
Uh-huh

#s42
That 's right

#s43
Uh-huh

#s44
Oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people

#s46
If they 're if they 're not uh you know fully functional mentally while they 're doing their job They could cause you know serious injury to oth- another people

#s50
Uh-huh

#s51
Uh-huh

#s53
Uh-huh

#s55
That 's right

#s56
Oh yeah

#s58
Uh-huh

#s61
So

#s62
Right

#s64
Right

#s67
Uh-huh

#s70
Uh-huh

#s73
Oh yes

#s74
Uh-huh

#s75
That 's right

#s78
Uh-huh

#s79
You know I think personally I 'm for it

#s80
There 's several reason why I I could think of right now why we should n't have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it

#s82
And

#s84
Yes

#s85
And oh yeah

#s86
it 's very expensive

#s88
And uh

#s90
Uh-huh

#s91
It 's not like a normal urinalysis

#s93
it 's very expensive to run them

#s94
And uh I did n't get a raise this year

#s95
because nobody in our company got a raise

#s97
But yet they spend all the money on drug testing

#s99
and if they were n't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise

#s100
So see there you know there 's different

#s101
I do n't think that that 's that I think that 's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there 's really a problem

#s103
and I know that

#s104
But then I have other views to it

#s106
Uh-huh

#s108
Uh-huh

#s110
Uh-huh

#s113
Right

#s115
Uh-huh

#s118
Theirs might not run a thousand dollars

#s119
Our

#s120
from what I understanding here at T I they run close to a thousand dollars an employee

#s126
Uh-huh

#s127
Uh-huh

#s129
But no

#s130
for all the the

#s131
Oh it 's
