#s1
Well do you do any recycling

#s6
Yeah

#s9
Oh

#s11
Well we uh

#s12
there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is uh aluminum cans

#s14
But uh we 've got a we 've got a couple of different things uh places uh

#s15
they 're like unattended aluminum can smashers

#s16
And you can go up there and and uh redeem

#s17
we 've got one that gives you like a penny a can

#s18
so if you

#s20
Yeah

#s22
Well actually you have to give put them in there unsmashed

#s24
And uh when you do that it it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot

#s26
Sure

#s30
Okay

#s31
Okay

#s34
Well I heard it that I heard it that time

#s39
Uh no

#s40
you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that

#s45
Oh okay

#s47
Okay

#s48
no

#s49
they do n't charge us that extra nickel

#s51
Yeah

#s52
it it really is

#s53
Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the off the price if you want to think of it that way

#s55
So when we get like uh uh a twelve pack then that 's like twelve cents back

#s58
Yeah

#s61
Yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s64
yeah

#s65
everybody does newspapers

#s67
Yeah

#s70
Well shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed uh Pepsi cans and whatever up there

#s78
I I I tell you

#s79
what what really works uh at least down here is if there is if there is some e- even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it you know what I mean then people tend to do it

#s80
Uh

#s83
In other words taking care of the environment is is all well and good

#s85
but if it 's going to cost you to take care of the environment they 're not quite as uh likely to do it as if uh if you get something back for it You know

#s90
And uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer you know

#s91
it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card you know to get money or doing your banking

#s94
You know if it 's free people will use it

#s95
if it costs them something then they 're not as likely to use it

#s98
You know

#s99
But uh I know we had a problem down here with uh oil people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the d- you know the s- the drain sewer

#s102
And uh all that because there was

#s103
apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil they just dump all the res- their old oil down there

#s105
Now they 're starting to recycle that stuff

#s109
Yeah

#s113
Yeah

#s115
Yeah

#s119
Yeah

#s120
I know a lot of places they uh uh
