Supposed to talk about boats

#s2
Have you got a boat

#s6
No

#s7
I do n't

#s8
I I 've had one for quite a few years

#s9
but I I 've not had one the last couple of years

#s11
But it 's something I 've always enjoyed

#s12
Do you do you like boating

#s15
Yeah

#s16
but uh my children all have been grown for a coup- few years

#s17
and we were using it less and less and less

#s18
so we decided to sell it

#s19
And

#s21
What 's that

#s23
Oh no

#s24
now I loved having a boat

#s25
I loved having it

#s26
No

#s30
Oh okay

#s34
Oh yeah

#s36
Yeah

#s37
guy just you know

#s38
he needs his weekends free or to be able to use it or a day during the week or something

#s40
but but no

#s41
I guess for the cost of them you do n't really

#s42
it 's hard to get

#s43
I do n't know

#s44
I felt like I got my money 's worth out of mine

#s45
I had bought it used and kept it uh I do n't know ten years and got within uh three hundred dollars of what when I sold it of what I 'd paid for it and had it all those years you know

#s47
So they hold their you take care of them they hold their value real well

#s49
So you know you could n't complain about that

#s51
No

#s52
no

#s53
it was a uh big boat big ski boat type thing

#s55
I had a hundred hundred sixty horse uh Murcruiser in it

#s57
Inboard outboard

#s58
Oh I did fish out of it occasionally

#s59
but I 'm not too much of a fisherman

#s61
And uh but I but I did enjoy owning a boat

#s64
would recommend it to anybody

#s65
And uh uh but uh and now sailing I 've never been sailing

#s66
Have you been sailing

#s70
Uh-huh

#s72
I 've never tried

#s73
I 've always thought I bet that would be more fun

#s74
But I 'd want to be with a skilled sailor

#s77
But it

#s79
Yeah

#s80
well I I 've always thought I 'd like to

#s81
I 've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it you know

#s83
And at this stage of the game I 'm not that interested in it anymore

#s85
We go out with friends on the

#s86
we go to the lake just about every weekend down at Mount Vernon

#s87
and parents ' next door neighbors have a big barge

#s89
and we go out and take them out on their barge

#s90
They 're getting kind of old

#s91
and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often

#s92
so we we get out on the water occasionally you know

#s95
But uh uh anyway it 's it 's it 's fun

#s96
I I do enjoy the lake

#s97
but uh once the children were grown

#s98
and we 'd go down there

#s99
and I 'd get the boat out on the you know Saturday

#s100
and we 'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much

#s101
It 's such a pretty lake down there

#s102
We 'd enjoy it so much

#s103
and I 'd say well I 'm going to leave the boat out because uh we 'll probably do this again tomorrow

#s104
It got to where the tomorrow the boat was still sitting there

#s105
and we never did go out again

#s106
and I 'd have to go load it up the next day

#s107
And

#s109
Uh Mount Vernon

#s111
Cypress Springs

#s112
Cypress Cr- Creek Springs

#s115

#s118
It 's probably the prettiest lake in the state of Texas

#s120

#s148
Uh-huh

#s150

#s154
Yeah

#s156
Uh-huh

#s157
Yes

#s158
