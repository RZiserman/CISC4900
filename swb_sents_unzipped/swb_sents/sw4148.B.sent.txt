Hi

#s4
Yeah

#s5
actually I I agree that that 's an interesting thing

#s6
I I believe that 's a for for civil suits it 's not unanimous right

#s7
but for for criminal suits it 's unanimous by federal law

#s9
Yeah

#s10
I actually thought I 'd read that too

#s11
and that 's why I phrased it that way

#s13
I wonder

#s14
the difference yeah the difference could be that for uh state if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote

#s15
and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal do n't require

#s16
but I do n't know what the the laws

#s17
do you think that that 's an unreasonable uh requirement that they be unanimous

#s21
Yeah

#s22
that that would be an interesting change

#s23
It was also allow the uh idea that if you had one person who was uh very disagreeable that

#s24
I mean it it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because uh the fact that it 's w- the the principle is that the fact that it 's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt uh criterion that it uh increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgment

#s25
So I I think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision

#s29
Yeah

#s30
actually I I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do

#s32
I would like to do that

#s33
I 've been out here twenty some years

#s34
and I 've been called uh three different times

#s35
but I 've never actually even made it into the the jury box And because there have always been a number of people

#s37
and and I 've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions

#s38
Uh I

#s39
yeah

#s40
I also think that would be really good

#s41
I

#s43
Uh-huh

#s45
Well the the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I 've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it 's nine to three or some such number that there 's an effect starts being that there 's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on

#s47
and that that uh peer pressure

#s48
and in some cases if it 's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons

#s51
Uh

#s52
Uh-huh

#s54
Yeah

#s55
I I understand

#s56
You you would hope that if you were in that situation that you 'd have the moral fortitude uh to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response

#s57
I think of the movie uh TWELVE ANGRY MEN

#s59
You ever seen that movie

#s62
Uh yeah

#s63
it 's it 's it 's exactly that situation where uh

#s64
it 's Henry Fonda

#s65
and it 's eleven to one

#s66
and he 's the one

#s67
I I believe he was opposed to the conviction

#s68
and uh and he held on

#s69
and
