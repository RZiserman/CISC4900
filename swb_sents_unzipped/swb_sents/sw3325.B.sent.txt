I love my cats

#s68
I had one cat for eighteen years

#s69
I got her when I lived in Hawaii

#s71
Before I even got married I had my cat

#s73
Well she I had to have her put to sleep last June

#s77
Oh it was awful

#s78

#s80
But and she just sat there on my lap you know

#s82
She just just waited

#s83
and

#s85
Oh it was awful

#s87
But her hair

#s88
but the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband 's shoes

#s91
You know and she just liked his shoes

#s92
and he 'd have these dress sh- hundred dollar shoes

#s95
Oh it was just bad

#s96
And my closet

#s97
and it was oh something

#s100
Oh it was terrible

#s101
And once she did it you know then she would I mean she would n't

#s102
if our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husband 's shoes

#s104
She must have known he did n't like her or something

#s106
