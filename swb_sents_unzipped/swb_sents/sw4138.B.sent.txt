Well I think they 're a necessary evil

#s3
Uh I wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on

#s4
and that is uh you you do n't spend more than you than you bring in

#s15
Well I

#s16
it just depends

#s17
Uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity

#s18
and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh

#s19
you know they need to make a living

#s22
So I think for for for many years uh we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants uh

#s23
we have not paid them really what they 're worth in what they contribute to society

#s26
But uh then again uh it 's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments

#s37
Uh you 're very fortunate

#s42
We just try not to pay any more in than we have to

#s43
uh we pay in a substantial amount

#s44
Uh

#s46
We do n't regret paying taxes

#s47
We do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax

#s49
And progressive tax I think uh does not give people incentive to make more money

#s50
and what I mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay

#s52
It should be I think a flat percentage

#s53
and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount

#s56
Uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the uh nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one uh I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else

#s59
and I totaled them all up

#s60
and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax

#s62
Now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though there 's uh taxes on different things

#s65
But you know there 's f- there 's a lot of taxes you pay that you 're not even aware of that you 're paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax

#s68
You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank

#s73
But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes

#s79
Yeah

#s80
if you impl- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money

#s81
and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes

#s83
And so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here 's my break point

#s84
I 'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs

#s88
And so

#s89
Based on that who do you think you 're talking to

#s90
you 're talking to an employer
