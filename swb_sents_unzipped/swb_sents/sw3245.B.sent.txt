#s1
Okay

#s2
I 'm ready

#s5
Uh-huh

#s7
No

#s8
I work at home

#s12
Do you have children

#s15
Oh that 's good

#s17
I have four girls

#s19
they 're nine and five and three and a newborn

#s21
Yes

#s25
Girls are nice are n't they

#s28
Anyway as far as clothing goes um my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size

#s30
We go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes clothes that are in between where you 're not down to regular size yet or you 're on your way up from regular size

#s35
and they 're all in boxes or bags

#s36
and they all rotate all the time

#s37
kind of the same stuff all the time though

#s39
I do n't uh get a whole lot new right now

#s45
Yeah

#s46
Yeah

#s47
I I like jeans a lot

#s52
Oh and it 's it 's frustrating

#s53
I just I find I have to get the right kinds though or it 's not comfortable

#s55
they

#s56
it it works best if they have pleats in the front

#s59
and uh they have to

#s60
my waist is kind of small compared to the hips

#s61
so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind

#s66
But um but I

#s67
when I was I was pregnant through the summer this time

#s68
and I wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist

#s74
but uh

#s77
Yeah

#s78
yeah

#s81
Uh-huh

#s85
Yeah

#s86
yeah

#s89
Oh I have n't tried those

#s91
Huh

#s93
Yeah

#s95
Yeah

#s99
Uh-huh

#s101
I do n't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here

#s102
but I sure never wear them

#s106
Yeah

#s108
Uh-huh

#s111
I 'm watching Janice

#s112
uh-huh

#s115
Oh

#s117
I I remember that from when I was

#s118
I worked way before I was married even

#s119
but offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you ca n't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable

#s123
you 've got to have something to add to it or something

#s126
I do n't know if you can

#s129
You burn up

#s131
Yeah

#s133
Yeah

#s135
It 's hard on the car

#s139
Oh

#s142
Yeah

#s144
Oh that 's funny

#s146
Yeah

#s147
at least something cooler

#s150
That 's true

#s151
Yeah

#s152
I do n't have to worry a whole lot about that

#s156
That 's right

#s157
something that it does n't matter if it gets spit up on too

#s161
I 've always been a creature of comfort too

#s163
if it 's not comfortable forget it

#s166
Wool was never comfortable to me
