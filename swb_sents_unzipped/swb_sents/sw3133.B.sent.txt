#s1
Okay

#s4
No

#s8
Yeah

#s10
I think it 's a good idea

#s11
I think everybody should should uh put in their time so to speak for the for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves

#s13
I think it 's uh

#s14
would every- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country 's all about

#s18
Did you

#s19
Oh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s25
Yeah

#s26
Really

#s27
Yeah

#s28
I think that 's probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know

#s30
they just they were they did things for people you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now I 'm not sure they really do

#s38
Uh-huh

#s39
Yeah

#s40
that 's probably true You know

#s42
but even even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to

#s47
Uh-huh

#s48
Yeah

#s49
I think that 's probably true

#s51
I think it 's probably more true still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities

#s56
Well I live in Richardson right now Which is just

#s60
Right

#s61
Yeah

#s62
okay

#s66
Yeah

#s67
Gosh

#s68
I had n't even thought about it being out of the area

#s69
but you 're right

#s70
Yeah

#s71
I grew up in a real small town in Florida

#s73
I mean a real small town

#s74
And uh I think it was just

#s75
of course it was back in the in the fifties

#s76
and I think it was real prevalent back then

#s77
I I think people thought more of others than they do now You know as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it

#s84
Uh-huh

#s85
Yeah

#s86
I do to

#s87
I do to

#s88
I 'm not sure that that today 's kids would go for it though

#s89
I think you would have to start younger

#s91
I I do n't know how young you 'd have to go

#s92
but I think by the time they 're oh early teenagers anyway I think it 's too late now At least around here

#s96
Right

#s98
Uh-huh

#s107
Yeah

#s108
I think it has to start in the families first because if you do n't do it for for your own immediate family you 're sure not going to do it for anybody else

#s114
Uh-huh

#s118
That 's probably true

#s119
That 's probably true

#s122
Uh-huh

#s124
Oh that 's great

#s128
Uh-huh

#s133
Uh-huh

#s135
Well that 's that 's great

#s136
I 'm glad that there are still some areas that that get the youth involved in that sort of thing

#s138
Like I said I think it does

#s139
e- even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes

#s141
Well

#s144
No

#s145
no

#s146
I guess that 's about all

#s148
Okay

#s150
Well good talking with you

#s152
You too

#s154
Okay

#s157
Bye
