#s2
Yeah

#s3
I have two two boys twelve and sixteen

#s5
Uh-huh

#s6
how about you

#s9
Oh

#s12
Right

#s15
Well

#s17
That 's true

#s18
You actually of course spend less time with them when they get older

#s19
but it 's of course still really important

#s21
I have a kind of a fortunate situation I think right now with my sixteen year old

#s22
Um I work two nights a week at a

#s23
I 'm a librarian

#s25
and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library

#s26
They keep it open you know for kids to do their work

#s28
and he um and then they the school district hires an aide you know to work for me

#s30
Well my son is my aide

#s32
So two nights a week for four hours we 're stuck together

#s34
and there 's usually not very much business

#s36
I mean some nights it 's just real real quiet

#s37
So

#s39
So we I have sort of a captive audience

#s40
so I really do spend probably more time with him than than most you know

#s42
But uh of course I 'm away from my other son those hours too

#s43
But his dad 's at home pretty much that time

#s45
Yeah

#s46
that 's true

#s47
yeah

#s49
But but it is hard once they get that age

#s50
I mean their friends are the most important thing there is

#s53
That 's right

#s57
Uh-huh

#s58
Uh-huh

#s60
Yeah

#s61
it 's kind of hard

#s65
Yeah

#s69
Uh-huh

#s72
Uh-huh

#s74
Right

#s75
Yeah

#s76
that 's true

#s78
Yes

#s79
it is hard to do

#s80
right

#s81
yeah

#s83
Well if you 're kind of a person that likes things you know organized or neat

#s85
or you know

#s87
then I think it it is hard

#s88
It 's um

#s89
I think one of the nice things about holidays is that you know it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah with family

#s91
We have we often go to Illinois for Christmas

#s93
and we 're not this year

#s94
and it 's just really nice because we can do you know the things you want to do

#s96
Yeah

#s97
Yeah

#s98
that 's right

#s103
Yeah

#s104
right

#s105
See we usually do that

#s106
my my kids even have already gotten out um

#s107
my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he has n't touched since last summer

#s110
but you know but every now and then I mean he 's got a lot of those technic those hard kind you know

#s111
and he wants to be an engineer

#s112
so he still likes all that kind of building stuff

#s114
and um we have the train

#s115
and we have n't had that Lego train together for years

#s116
and um so he sat down

#s117
and I told him I really wanted him to build the train and we would put it under the tree and that I would keep it together

#s118
I would n't take it apart

#s120
yeah

#s121
and every year I 'd have the Lego train under the tree

#s123
And um so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on Friday

#s124
and um then his sixteen year old brother started helping too you know

#s125
you know these are kind of things like during the normal rat race

#s128
those kinds of things never happen

#s130
but

#s134
Uh-huh

#s135
Yeah

#s137
Yes

#s138
yeah

#s139
Which is

#s141
Uh-huh

#s142
and there 's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it you know they 're totally turned off to everything else

#s143
The rest of

#s146
No

#s147
That 's right

#s151
Yeah

#s152
yeah

#s153
me too

#s154
Yeah

#s155
I do n't watch very much of it at all e- to to the extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that

#s156
yeah

#s159
they talk about T V shows

#s160
and I huh you know

#s161
how can you watch that you know

#s164
it 's the best show on

#s165
I do n't know
