#s1
Well uh ho- how do you view this whole subject

#s2
Are you uh one who feels like you have have benefited from the change in in roles in women

#s3
Or or what do you think

#s8
Uh-huh

#s12
Yes

#s13
oh yes

#s14
I think so

#s16
Are you uh are you someone who works outside your home

#s17
or have you

#s21
Oh yes

#s23
well uh have there been significant changes uh do you think in the employment place ex- especially uh say at T I

#s25
Have has anything in particular changed that you have noticed During your time there

#s28
Yeah

#s29
uh-huh

#s30
What what kind of work do you do

#s32
Uh-huh

#s34
Right

#s36
Yes

#s37
yes

#s39
Yes uh

#s41
yes

#s42
in years past I know in fact even even the word drafter has changed

#s44
because it used to be they were draftsman

#s48
Right

#s51
Maybe not huh

#s52
Well uh I when I was in college

#s53
I graduated from college with my bachelor 's degree in nineteen sixty-four

#s55
And I was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time

#s58
So I was in a lot of classes where uh there I was either the only girl or you know one of just a very few women in the class

#s61
So that was a change

#s62
and uh even uh I did not uh use my math uh in my work

#s63
I I became a technical writer

#s65
But uh even so there were very very few women in technical writing

#s67
But that has changed a lot

#s69
In recent years it has just really really changed a lot

#s72
And and I think that uh you know the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management

#s73
but I think they have got a long way to go

#s76
There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of uh chairmen of the board chair- chair persons uh if you sa- if you will of the board are women in this country

#s79
And I thought that you know that 's pretty si- a pretty significantly small number

#s81
So there are some some strides to be made there

#s84
But uh I do not know

#s85
I I think we have come a long way actually when I think about you know when things were like even when I you know just when I was in high school and how it is now for girls

#s90
And uh uh I guess my I the one my one bad thing is that I am that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because I think she would have really she rea- would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed in her generation

#s97
So anyway Do you have children

#s100
I was going to say do you have daughters

#s101
That 's always a good question

#s103
Yes

#s104
In fact I have a daughter who is in a who just graduated in civil engineering from college

#s106
So she is pretty much although there were some other women in her class she was you know uh one of the minorities

#s107
uh females in the class

#s112
So she definitely entering into uh a male profession

#s114
But uh But you know MUMBLEx for instance there are there is the organization women the Society of Women MUMBLEx Engineers

#s117
so that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be

#s121
But uh I do not know

#s122
I you see it in uh also in uh like in church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers In uh you know in protestant congregations

#s124
and uh it will be interesting to see if if Roman Catholicism ever uh recognizes women in in the role of priest

#s125
I do- I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or you know what you know about that

#s129
I am not either

#s130
but uh that is one area where it that I can see might change but I really doubt will change

#s134
No

#s135
probably not

#s136
Huh-uh

#s137
So uh uh how about what in particular would you think that uh women still other than the work place where women still are being uh oh you know MUMBLEx found wanting you know or not re- as highly regarded as men would be

#s138
Uh

#s139
I was just trying to think

#s140
Oh I know something

#s142
Maybe you could te-

#s143
what do you think that what do you think tell me what you think about this

#s145
The uh the uh the role of women in combat roles during the war

#s147
Because I know that there now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles

#s150
And the only uh branch in the armed fo- services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force

#s151
And uh I spoke because women were filing flying missions into you know for whatever reason into uh in the Persian Gulf war

#s155
And so But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job

#s156
It was real interesting

#s157
they were I was listening to some of the comments on ra- television the other day uh about it

#s159
and uh one of one of the men who was a

#s160
I do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was

#s161
very high

#s163
He said MUMBLEx it 's just a personal thing with me

#s164
I mean I can not be real you know I can not tell you why I feel this way

#s165
but I just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman

#s166
I thought well at least he was honest

#s167
But that does not sit very well with a lot of folks I am sure

#s169
Yeah

#s170
right

#s171
You know Neil well Neil as far as I am concerned and MUMBLEx I could be wrong about this but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something

#s175
Uh because I would think I think you know mentally uh and emotionally I think women can handle a job and every bit as well

#s177
So anyway it 's still MUMBLEx

#s181
Sure

#s184
No

#s185
I would not either

#s186
No

#s187
I agree

#s188
but I am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of job

#s191
So Uh I guess that should be taken into consideration as well

#s195
So well this is an interesting topic

#s196
um I have you know I have

#s197
having a daughter who has gone into this into engineering I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did

#s200
She 's a lot more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive than I think I was

#s202
So that 's that 's progress I guess

#s204
Well I have enjoyed talking with you Lisa

#s205
and Uh have you talked with a lot of people in this project

#s207
or

#s209
Yeah

#s211
Oh yeah

#s214
Oh yeah

#s216
Right

#s218
Yeah

#s219
well that 's great

#s221
that 's good

#s224
Yeah

#s225
Yeah

#s226
Well

#s228
Yeah

#s229
well that 's good

#s232
that 's good

#s233
because uh I I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls And uh only because I going to make some money

#s236
see we our choir is doing this as a money ma- raising project

#s238
We we got the connection through a T I uh church member

#s240
And uh uh so we are doing it to raise money for uh a large project at church

#s242
and uh so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that 's not too painful

#s243
Financially painful anyway

#s246
It 's just real nice that way

#s247
so uh I thought well I will just get on the stick and do it

#s250
Well I will say good-bye to you

#s252
but I have enjoyed the conversation

#s254
Thank you
