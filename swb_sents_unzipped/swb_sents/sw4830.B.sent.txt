#s2
No

#s3
you can start

#s6
Uh-huh

#s10
Right

#s12
Right

#s13
There 's there th- this topic is kind of mute Uh

#s15
there there 's no way

#s16
We we could n't survive in a sy- in a juror syst- in a trial system without a jury

#s18
Uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case

#s20
Uh every person has their opinions

#s21
and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult Uh

#s26
Right

#s30
Right

#s31
They should n't allow an appeal

#s33
Yep

#s35
Uh-huh

#s37
Oh that 's right

#s38
I work for a law firm MUMBLEx

#s41
Right

#s43
Well plea bar- plea bargaining is a different story

#s45
Plea bargaining is something completely different

#s46
That that actually prevents trials Or at least speeds them up

#s53
Right

#s55
Right

#s57
Huh

#s60
Right

#s62
We do

#s65
Right

#s69
Right

#s70
When you 're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned

#s72
We just have the case

#s73
I 'm I 'm sure you 've probably heard of Marion Berry

#s75
Uh his f- last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up

#s77
So I mean his appeal was denied

#s78
and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession

#s81
But uh that was absurd

#s82
There is never there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence

#s87
Well uh the the only

#s88
I can I wa- you know

#s89
the appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of

#s90
Uh a- like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that 's absurd

#s91
There 's no way that could work

#s94
Uh but

#s97
Oh exactly

#s99
Exactly

#s100
Right

#s102
No one would want the job

#s105
Uh and you know like I said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case

#s107
Oh yeah

#s108
I I feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury

#s109
That that that right s-

#s111
Well I mean were there witnesses

#s113
Right

#s114
Right

#s115
That you ca n't you ca n't remove the jury regardless of the case

#s117
I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place

#s119
and you you 'd still there 's still mitigating circumstances
