#s1
Okay

#s2
Uh do you want to go ahead

#s3
or

#s7
Uh-huh

#s8
Uh-huh

#s12
Uh-huh

#s17
Right

#s19
I do too

#s20
I like the idea

#s21
I see a lot more uh

#s22
my children I have five children

#s23
and they 're all married

#s25
And uh I love seeing the men help the women so much

#s27
And they both cooperate together on

#s28
I think it 's great

#s32
MUMBLEx

#s37
Right

#s39
That 's right

#s40
That 's right

#s43
I 've always taught my men that

#s44
They better clean up with their women and help them

#s45
If they did that you know

#s47
And they 're they 're good about it

#s48
But it is neat to see them all work together

#s49
And a big thing that I see All that most of the most of the women getting married now uh go back have gone back to you know

#s51
they they stay at work or go back to work Or whatever

#s53
And they 're well educated

#s55
And I believe we 'll see a lot more C E O -s in companies

#s56
They 're having a fit about how little there are

#s58
And I think we 'll see a lot more Do n't you Of upper management Then we do now even

#s62
I think it 'll escalate

#s64
And uh and I think black women now

#s65
i- in fact I work at a high school

#s67
And my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted

#s68
and she 's very sharp

#s69
And I think that th-

#s70
and the ethnic thing will be you know is a good thing now

#s72
They 're moving them up

#s73
and they 're sharp

#s74
and they

#s75
so you 're going to see a lot a lot more of that in leadership I believe

#s79
Uh-huh Right

#s81
Right

#s82
That 's a shame

#s84
Yes

#s86
Yeah

#s87
But they would n't know what they 're doing

#s89
But I 'm not big on subserving as far as to the men at all

#s92
But I never have gone along with that you know Even far back

#s93
But I was brought up pretty good in a home that

#s94
years ago my mother was that way

#s95
The same

#s96
I

#s97
my bo-

#s98
ther- you know

#s99
some people say oh the boys should n't have to do those jobs The inside jobs

#s100
But we never were taught

#s101
they had to do as much as we did

#s102
So that was good

#s106
So that 's I think that 's good To keep the equal as far as as uh not nex- nex- uh necessarily by sex type thing You know

#s109
You should be able to accomplish as much

#s110
And I think the uh attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now

#s112
You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you know you can do it

#s114
If he can do it you can do it type thing

#s118
Uh-huh

#s119
Uh-huh

#s120
Right

#s121
What about politics on it

#s123
Do you think the political scene

#s126
Yeah

#s128
I 'm real dis- I 'm kind of disgusted this year because I do n't see many women into the political scene

#s129
and I really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for President and Vice President this year

#s132
there 's nobody again

#s133
I think they 're all scared out after tha- after uh

#s134
oh what was the lady 's name that ran a couple of

#s135
Fitz-

#s136
I forget her name now

#s138
But you know who I mean

#s141
Yeah

#s142
She took such a rough go of it

#s143
And they t- their tax deal and

#s146
Right

#s147
Right

#s149
But I wish they would get some more on that

#s150
I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they 're talking about

#s151
Uh they I did n't see any of the women in there

#s153
And that disappoints me

#s155
And right now I do n't think we have too many Uh th- in the forefront

#s156
Schroeder 's about the biggest one in Washington

#s158
Congress woman

#s159
And uh other th- uh

#s160
we really
