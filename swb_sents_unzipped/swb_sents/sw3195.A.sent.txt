Uh what i- what is your practice as far as budgeting

#s2
Do you manage the money

#s5
Oh I see

#s6
That 's how kind of I am too

#s7
Are you married

#s9
You are

#s11
I think the women for the most part end up managing the money

#s12
My husband always says he earns it and I have to spend only what he earns

#s13
It

#s17
Well I do n't work outside of the home

#s18
and he always threatens that when I spend more than what 's coming in I have to go back to work

#s20
so I I manage it

#s23
Now do you actually follow a budget

#s32
Well that 's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past

#s33
I would say Uh

#s34
at this point our children are grown

#s35
and so I really do n't have the obligations there any more that we have to balance to you know get things together for them

#s38
and I really just keep very good records

#s39
and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that

#s40
and I try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently

#s43
uh I do n't always succeed at that

#s44
I usually keep one with a low interest rate

#s45
and I put things on there that I think I 'm not going to get to

#s47
and then I have another one

#s48
but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point

#s49
we 're in a new home

#s50
and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to

#s52
so I 'm still getting used to that

#s53
but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we 're going to pay for it ahead

#s55
and we do not buy us new cars

#s56
Uh do you get into car

#s65
We do for us

#s66
very much so

#s67
In fact we are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just do n't go to a new car you know whatever

#s68
and I said look you guys are all into car payments

#s70
we have n't had car payments for so many years

#s71
I love it this way

#s72
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked

#s73
and it has eighty-two thousand miles on it

#s75
and we were kept saying would n't it be great if we could find another one just like it

#s76
Believe it or not we did

#s77
we found one one newer

#s79
the worst part is it 's the same color

#s81
and so everybody 's saying you 're kidding

#s82
you have two cars the same

#s83
and I said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again

#s85
I said well we had one

#s86
and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it

#s88
and it 's an eighty-five

#s89
and so I said Hey this was a cinch

#s90
we paid for the car

#s91
and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on

#s93
This is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things

#s94
and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably

#s96
Generally from dealers

#s97
and uh it depends because I do n't like to sell what we 're trading in to an individual uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell

#s100
you know we were going up to a larger one

#s101
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal

#s102
I mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying do n't bring us the manager and all of that unless you want to bring him right away

#s103
You 're going to get one shot at us

#s105
we will you know

#s106
and they say Well you 're kidding you know

#s107
I s-

#s108
no

#s109
this is the price we 're going to give you out the door

#s110
We do n't want to hear about taxes
