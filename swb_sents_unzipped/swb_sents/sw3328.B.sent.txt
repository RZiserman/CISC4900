#s3
Well they 've uh statewide raises

#s4
they raise ours it seems like constantly

#s5
We just uh passed a new one

#s6
uh fortunately or unfortunately it does n't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines

#s9
Right

#s10
And uh we had passed a a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes

#s11
But uh at least we thought we 'd get something back from that

#s13
Uh how do you feel about taxes

#s22
Oh

#s26
I 've never seen taxes really go down

#s32
Oh

#s34
I hope they put that in writing

#s39
I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and uh that the rich are not paying their share

#s40
and of course the poor ca n't afford it either

#s41
but uh I really feel like

#s42
and and I feel like you know

#s43
I 'm a middle class person income wise anyway

#s44
and uh I get tired of supporting the whole country

#s50
You think the rich are paying too much

#s54
Well I do n't know many rich that do n't have enough tax breaks to

#s55
I mean I 'm talking about the really rich

#s57
Right

#s59
Now I 'll go along with that You know

#s63
Right

#s64
Now I think that would be fair

#s66
And I you know

#s67
no no ifs ands and buts you know

#s68
no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review

#s69
It 's just you know you make this you pay ten percent

#s70
If you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent

#s71
if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent

#s75
Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal

#s77
And uh they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate

#s79
So and and you withhold no matter what you do

#s80
they withhold what they 're supposed to

#s81
and at the end of the year it 's not enough

#s84
Right

#s85
so now you know when you sign your W-Four form or whatever W-Two whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state Which is ridiculous

#s87
but it 's been that way for the last probably ten years

#s92
Right

#s93
unless you have a lot of deductions

#s95
But you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you state wise

#s97
And you end up owing you know

#s98
you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal

#s99
and you 're going to owe fifteen hundred in state

#s101
And uh it 's it 's just ridiculous

#s102
But I I do n't know

#s103
I 've

#s104
they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in in Oklahoma county

#s105
and that is a chunk

#s108
I mean twenty-five percent increase
