#s1
Okay

#s3
Well I think that it it varies on on the individual basis

#s5
Uh sometimes it is there is no alternative

#s7
Uh you do not have uh uh family available or family that 's uh

#s8
you may not even have family that is uh uh in you know who are around

#s11
So sometimes it 's not an alternative

#s13
And I think uh but I think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it 's for a short time

#s14
Sometimes in a nursing home

#s16
uh especially if if it 's after an acute illness

#s17
To get over a

#s18
or to rehab after uh an illness

#s22
Sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time

#s25
Uh-huh

#s26
Because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they 're really able to

#s30
So so there is some good to it

#s32
Uh sometimes too it 's used as a dumb job

#s33
You know the fam- well the families do not necessarily uh know what to do with them

#s35
and they do n't want to take the responsibility

#s36
so they will put them in a nursing home

#s39
So you see uh there 's both sides to it too

#s40
What do you think

#s45
Yeah

#s50
That 's true

#s52
I think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to

#s53
it 's there 's not a choice it 's because it 's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home

#s57
So that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it

#s60
So

#s64
Yeah

#s65
and then there 's also some that are set up for specialties

#s67
uh I know some

#s68
Unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have I guess it 's Alzheimer 's or where they wonder or or uh confused or have some mental problem

#s72
And you need a special nursing home for that

#s73
You need one that has a unit that 's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around

#s75
and you need people who are trained for that type of problem

#s78
Yeah

#s79
so so there 's different types of nursing homes I think

#s84
Uh-huh

#s91
Gives her a little bit of her own independence

#s93
but she still has uh a security there

#s99
That 's right

#s100
and I I 've seen some of them like that too

#s102
and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active

#s106
So it 's not sort of like uh uh a sick place

#s115
Yeah

#s116
I I think I think the uh I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the uh elderly uh person who 's going in and the family that 's going to be uh effec- effected by it

#s120
and uh you know sometimes it can those choi- those choices can be made in advance

#s121
and sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they 're
