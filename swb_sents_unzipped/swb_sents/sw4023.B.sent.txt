#s3
Right

#s4
I I I actually I live in the city

#s6
and uh I guess it is a concern of mine uh you know for my own safety

#s10
Well that 's right

#s11
Uh Uh I think it is bad in certain areas

#s13
however I think the area that I live in it 's not uh the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city

#s15
I think it seems that there 's certain areas where uh the crime is focused uh

#s18
Well I think it 's what 's been happening over the last several years it seems they 've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility

#s19
and uh they 've had some impact but not a tremendous amount

#s21
and probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing I think MUMBLEx

#s23
Yeah

#s25
You know particularly in some of the housing projects uh you know that 's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused

#s27
and they 've got to do more than just having having cops there

#s28
They 've got to kind of change the way people think about it

#s32
Um well I 've been to

#s33
I 'd say it 's it 's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime

#s34
Um it 's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example

#s36
Probably not not as bad as Detroit

#s39
No

#s41
Yeah

#s42
that seems to be true

#s43
Um yeah

#s44
if you 've ever been to like New York City

#s45
and you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed

#s48
It 's that obvious

#s52
Yeah

#s53
that 's true

#s55
With a big stick

#s56
or

#s58
Right

#s59
Sure

#s60
Right

#s61
do n't do n't walk down a an alley

#s62
or do n't get

#s64
just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation

#s66
but yeah

#s67
there are times when you ca n't avoid all that

#s69
and and then you 're kind of on your own

#s72
Uh no

#s73
The only thing I 've ever had was I 've had my wallet lifted

#s75
but that was in a more of a a setting where there was a number of people around

#s76
and I kind of got

#s77
I was much younger at the time

#s79
and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so I did n't know who had it

#s82
I 've had that happen

#s83
but that 's that 's about it

#s87
Oh yeah

#s89
Um

#s91
Really

#s92
well I 've had my

#s94
Uh-huh

#s95
I 've had my car stolen

#s96
so maybe that counts

#s98
Yeah

#s102
Oh no

#s103
that was in the northern p- um up near Cumberland Mall area

#s105
It 's actually Cobb County

#s106
but it is Atlanta

#s109
and uh there 's a lot of car thefts in that area

#s113
Right

#s114
Yeah

#s117
Yeah

#s118
mine was just it had been wrecked

#s119
and some superficial type damage

#s120
but they did n't they did n't strip it

#s122
so I got it back

#s124
Yeah

#s125
than most

#s129
Right

#s130
It was about three grand to put everything together

#s131
They cracked the steering column of course to steal the car

#s132
Yeah

#s133
you got to you crack the steering column

#s134
and you pull the

#s135
there 's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars

#s137
and you can start it up basically pretty easily

#s140
Well after I found mine I had to I had this
