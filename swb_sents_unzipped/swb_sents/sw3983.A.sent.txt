Oh good

#s9
That 's a good one I like to get

#s10
Um so I take it that you like to ski

#s11
Do you do you um receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE

#s13
Uh-huh

#s15
Oh

#s16
Oh uh and do you receive discounts and things like that do you think

#s17
or

#s22
Oh

#s24
Oh

#s25
Uh-huh

#s26
So would this vacation you 're taking

#s27
did you receive information from your skiing magazine

#s33
Oh

#s34
Oh

#s36
Um that sounds nice

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40

#s43

#s49

#s51

#s54
Uh I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING and uh COUNTRY LIVING

#s55
and let 's see we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC

#s56
and then we have some church magazines

#s57
but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING

#s58
I 'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that

#s59
so the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great great help

#s62
Uh-huh

#s63
Uh-huh

#s64
they do have uh mostly they have uh the ads on the equipment

#s65
but the whole magazine is just filled with uh pictures and projects that you can make yourself

#s66
and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project and and then how to paint it with the tole paintings

#s67
and so it 's really a fun one

#s68
I like that

#s71
Uh-huh

#s75
Uh-huh

#s77
Uh-huh

#s78
Yeah

#s79
Yes

#s80
I 've I 've noticed that too

#s81
but they have been nice to have around

#s82
Every once in a while they come in handy

#s84
Oh

#s86
Uh-huh

#s88
Oh

#s91
Oh that

#s95

#s109
I found that they 've been fun for my little girls

#s110
they 're five and four years old

#s111
and they like to go through and

#s114
Uh-huh They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on

#s115
and so we 've found good use for those

#s118
Oh

#s120
Oh

#s121
Uh-huh

#s122
Yeah

#s123

#s125
