#s2
All right

#s3
Well I am uh the product of uh I think as much the changing roles of women as anyone

#s4
my mother uh

#s5
we come from a

#s6
my mother and I were uh really prac- first generation divorce in our family

#s8
My uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty-seven when I was seven years old

#s11
And was I was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known to have a divorce

#s13
Of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States uh

#s14
my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my father 's side of the family

#s15
and also uh uh uh we were uh ostracized by his family uh

#s16
basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth

#s19
And they all felt that th- there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce

#s21
Uh it was always my mother 's fault

#s22
she was not uh sufficient you know

#s23
she just was not good enough

#s24
What was wrong with her was she not attractive enough

#s25
did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest

#s26
It was that kind of an attitude

#s29
So uh

#s30
yeah

#s31
it was too bad

#s32
it was really rough

#s35
Uh so you know that 's so changing

#s36
some of the changing roles of women in that respect I have been a product of

#s38
Um I think that there are people that I think that uh

#s39
I was a- I was first generation going to college in my family

#s41
Uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position

#s42
She did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial pro- profession in Des Moines Iowa

#s44
She was a secretary to uh uh the jud- to uh a circuit court judge federal judge

#s46
And it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him

#s47
So that was a really high high status position

#s49
She made over thirty thousand a year

#s51
Well yeah

#s52
she a real hard la-

#s54
Yeah

#s56
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know

#s58
But uh so I went to college and now since have completed two master 's degrees

#s59
and I am the director of music in a church

#s60
Um and but it 's interestingly enough I am still everyday confronted with

#s62
Absolutely

#s64
Challenges that have to do with my sex

#s66
Uh for instance uh well you know I am just not taken as seriously you know at professions as many of the wom- as many of the men who are doing the same job I do

#s68
And uh the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman

#s69
they expect me to be more motherly

#s70
they question my authority more uh than they ever would a man

#s71
And I have experience with this because I work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man

#s74
So I am pretty I am pretty ob- pretty cons- I mean I am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church

#s76
So basically that 's that 's

#s77
well I am done talking

#s78
Do you want to talk

#s81
Uh-huh

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
Oh always

#s87
Uh-huh

#s89
Indeed

#s91
Uh-huh

#s93
Uh-huh

#s95
Uh-huh

#s97
Uh-huh

#s98
Uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s102
I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend I mean why they can not just accept you know competent women

#s103
I I have never been able to understand that

#s104
I guess it 's fear

#s105
I mean what

#s107
Sure

#s109
Uh-huh

#s111
Uh-huh

#s113
Uh-huh

#s114
uh-huh

#s116
Uh-huh

#s117
Uh-huh

#s118
Uh-huh

#s120
Uh-huh

#s121
Uh-huh

#s122
Uh-huh

#s123
Uh-huh

#s125
Uh-huh

#s126
Uh-huh

#s127
Men have a lot of trouble with that though

#s129
They in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal

#s130
and so it 's really difficult for them to treat women as equals

#s131
They are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower

#s132
Uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way

#s133
And I do not know if that 's I mean that 's it 's a militaristic point of view I guess you know

#s134
somebody can not be colonel

#s135
and everybody else is infantry

#s136
but it 's just really interesting to me

#s137
I am married to a wonderful man you know who treats me very you know with a with as

#s139
I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time

#s140
But when he gets angry it 's always over control issues

#s141
it 's always over power issues

#s142
it 's never over you know

#s143
it 's always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it As if he is the boss and I am the you know and I am the slave

#s145
And it

#s146
those are the only only issues we ever fight about

#s147
I think it 's just I think it 's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally

#s148
even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss

#s149
Uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient

#s151
Um

#s153
Um

#s155
Um

#s157
Um

#s159
Huh

#s161
Huh

#s163
Uh-huh

#s165
Uh-huh

#s167
Uh-huh

#s168
Uh-huh

#s169
Yeah

#s170
it 's true

#s172
Uh-huh

#s173
Uh-huh

#s175
Uh-huh

#s176
it would be

#s178
Uh-huh

#s180
Uh-huh
