The the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers The numbers that are being thrown around when when we 're talking in trillions of dollars Uh which is an astronomical sum

#s6
and and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means

#s9
The elected people

#s10
Yes

#s11
Uh-huh

#s13
Our our our Senate and Congress and and people that that deal everyday and and what 's going to be done with those monies um and do n't really understand what that is or how a budget even works

#s16
Uh we need to elect people that are more uh

#s17
or

#s21
Well let 's let 's make them have a degree in economy uh or economics

#s23
Well

#s25
Yeah

#s26
But but people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar

#s29
um and wh-

#s30
in in in

#s31
the the uh lobbyists needs them to be eliminated uh from Congress

#s32
Um

#s36
They do n't make pragmatic decisions

#s37
They make a decision based on consti- constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe

#s40
Um you know th- or they tack on this uh pork bellies and and do things that that are good for their area to pass something that is that is not good for the country

#s45
Oh I I definitely would

#s46
Yeah

#s47
Get rid of them

#s48
Totally Uh

#s50
I I think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute

#s52
But they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them

#s54
That that 's a conflict of interest as far as I 'm concerned

#s56
When you are talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars uh you 're you 're jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today

#s58
That

#s61
I I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that 's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line

#s62
You ca n't ease into it

#s63
It took years and years to build up the momentum that 's there now

#s65
Uh I I forget the figures on the interest rate

#s66
but it 's something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest

#s69
Part of the problem is we do n't loan from ourselves

#s70
We we buy from intimate international banking

#s71
That 's why we have interest

#s73
And and I I I really feel that that that is part of the problem that we we 've let things get so out of control that that we do n't want to put the brakes on them

#s76
By by having a a a budget that is is feasible that is reasonable

#s80
Oh of course

#s81
Sure

#s82
And then add on to it

#s83
You take the gross national income

#s84
and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income

#s86
One thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax Across-the-board

#s88
everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax

#s91
Uh

#s94
That 's right

#s95
Right

#s96
No deductions

#s98
You pay a ten percent income tax

#s100
That 's what you pay

#s101
if you make forty million dollars uh then you 're going to pay four million

#s103
I-

#s104
if you make forty dollars you 're going to pay four dollars

#s105
And and that 's it

#s112
I do n't know that it would or would n't
