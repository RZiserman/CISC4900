Well what I believe is one of the major pro- uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough discipline

#s3
and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now

#s7
Uh when I went to school I know I was scared to death about being disciplined

#s9
and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different

#s12
You know you just you did not see I did not see anybody in my classrooms when I was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom

#s17
Yeah

#s18
that 's right

#s19
that 's right

#s21
My my daughter 's in the um fourth grade

#s24
and um there 's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher can not teach

#s28
and when I went to school that just was n't put up with

#s32
Uh-huh

#s33
Well they they just do n't do that any more

#s35
But the school system 's afraid of getting sued and um all sorts of lawsuits I 'm sure because of things like that

#s39
And I also believe we do n't even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid

#s40
and we still do n't have enough money towards put in toward public school

#s44
And um I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems

#s47
Yes

#s48
supposedly that 's what it 's suppose to go for

#s49
and you know we 'll just have to wait and see whether that 's approved or not

#s51
You know I do n't know your feelings toward that

#s52
I guess we should n't get into that

#s53
but um and what else um

#s54
I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire

#s56
I have heard stories uh from other parents that I know of their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs

#s60
Oh yeah

#s62
I 've I 've heard some horrible horrible stories about high high school teachers

#s64
and you know to be be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school

#s66
Um that 's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system

#s67
I think with what they have to work with I think they 're doing a pretty good job right now

#s70
Uh-huh

#s71
so

#s73
You do n't have any children in school Do n't have any kids

#s74
I do n't have any kids

#s77
Yeah

#s78
okay

#s79
so this is probably a real hard subject for you

#s81
Yeah

#s82
Okay

#s83
well I guess um we can discontinue our call now

#s85
It was a joy in talking with you

#s87
Okay

#s88
thanks

#s91
Bye
