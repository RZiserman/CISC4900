Well what do you know about Latin American policies

#s4
Uh-huh

#s5
Huh Are you uh relating this uh to the uh affair we 've got going on in Haiti right now

#s8
Right

#s10
That that 's just it

#s13
Right

#s14
I guess my concern

#s15
you know no matter which no matter which side we take we 're going to have supporters

#s16
and we 're going to have uh antisupporters I guess for lack of better term

#s17
and uh like you said they 're such small countries that we 're bound to upset somebody

#s18
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance

#s21
Right

#s23
Right

#s25
That 's true

#s31
Sure

#s34
Yep

#s35
that 's about the lump sum of it

#s36
Well um I was speaking with a a woman from I believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala or somewhere in there

#s37
no

#s38
she was from El Salvador

#s40
and uh she was from a relatively wealthy family

#s41
and when uh the Contras came into power of course with

#s42
uh oh gosh darn what 's his face

#s43
he 's in in Florida jail now

#s44
Marcos

#s47
uh no

#s48
he 's Marcos is Philippines

#s51
Well you know who I 'm talking about

#s53
Yeah

#s54
I I know it uh

#s55
anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybody 's property you know just assigned it to himself

#s58
Right

#s59
right

#s60
and uh so she 's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect

#s61
and in that respect I have to agree that I think we 're taking the right stance uh because they were a democracy turned uh

#s64
yeah

#s65
right

#s67
basically a dictator fascist

#s71
Sure

#s72
Well what do you think of uh this uh U S free trade agreement we 're working on with Mexico

#s74
Uh-huh

#s82
Uh-huh

#s83
Mexico they 're I know they 're trying they 're really trying the Mexican government is trying and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to oh make themselves Americanized I guess and uh which is great because that 's what they basically need to do

#s85
The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know

#s87
and we do n't have the Siesta

#s89
and there 's the cultural differences is what 's is what 's kind of it 's what 's really hurting uh the Mexican people because they 've had their way of life

#s90
and we 've had our way of life

#s91
and uh
