Do you have any hobbies

#s4
What are yours

#s6
Ooh how great

#s9
Oh uh ceramic painting

#s11
The china more

#s13
How did you ever get into that

#s14
That sounds so interesting

#s20
How marvel-

#s21
I

#s27
Now do you do it just for yourself

#s28
or do you do it to give as gifts

#s29
or do you actually sell it

#s34
Oh that sounds mar-

#s35
now do you work outside of the home

#s37
You 've just retired

#s39
Oh oh what a great hobby

#s42
I

#s45
Do n't retire

#s47
Well see I do n't

#s48
I never uh returned to work for the p-

#s49
I have stayed home for about the last nine years

#s52
We 've transferred around

#s53
and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake uh on Lake Erie

#s54
So the lake life appealed to me

#s55
and my husband 's working

#s56
and he left it up to me if I worked or not

#s58
So in my spare time I love to sew

#s59
There are n't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing

#s60
but I do make all my own clothes

#s61
and we recently purchased a new home

#s62
so I enjoy doing my uh toppers for my window applications and things like that

#s64
But uh just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great

#s68
That is excellent

#s70
We 're in the sub- I 'm in the suburb of Cleveland

#s71
and I 'm about uh fifteen miles probably from downtown Cleveland something like that

#s72
And Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie

#s73
and prior to this we were fifty miles west from here

#s74
So we were right on the lake

#s75
And Cleveland is n't all as bad as what you 've heard

#s77
And you do find people uh into the crafts and the things that uh various things for spare time

#s78
but I have never heard and I have actually never run into anyone into the china painting

#s79
and I 'm just intrigued with it

#s83
Right

#s84
where you 're getting into the delicate work

#s86
Now do you where did you first get your lessons from

#s88
Through a uh an adult ed or strictly a china type

#s92
Oh how marvelous

#s100
Oh

#s101
and it 's so nice

#s103
It must be so nice for you now that you 're retired

#s108
Oh is n't that great

#s109
And you 'll probably really uh re- regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a a class again
