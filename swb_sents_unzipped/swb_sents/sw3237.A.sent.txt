#s1
Okay

#s2
so you said that you live in Coppell

#s4
So what is your house like

#s6
Oh well that 's neat

#s8
Uh-huh

#s9
is it one you 're renting or buying

#s14
Yeah

#s15
yeah

#s16
well that 's kind of neat that you can even though it 's a duplex you can still buy

#s19
That 's good

#s22
Do you have any children

#s26
Yes

#s27
I have two children

#s28
and our home is really too small for us right now

#s31
Yeah

#s32
we moved from an apartment that was really small

#s34
and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old

#s36
so we moved into this house in Garland

#s37
it 's in one of the older areas of town

#s39
and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere

#s41
you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty

#s43
but the the house is real small

#s45
it has less than a thousand square feet

#s47
yeah

#s48
it 's real little

#s50
Yeah

#s51
and now I have a daughter

#s52
now my the one that was five months old is seven years old

#s54
and the one I have another one that 's three and a half and have all these clothes and toys and stuff that we 're just trying to find places to put

#s59
Well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room you know

#s62
but the room that 's built on does n't have a closet

#s64
so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom

#s66
but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and

#s68
you know it 's kind of a catch all room

#s69
But it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play

#s71
they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff

#s73
so

#s75
Yeah

#s76
that works out good

#s77
And I 'm thankful I have two girls because they 're in bunk beds

#s78
and so you know they can share a room and uh make for more space that way

#s82
She 's three and a half

#s84
yeah

#s85
so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet

#s87
we made a higher and a lower

#s89
and it works out fine

#s90
but they 're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag you know

#s92
and um we 're going to have to figure out a new idea

#s93
But we 're we 're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home uh hoping to be able to do that within a year or so

#s96
so that would be nice

#s98
Yeah

#s99
is Coppell a nice area to live

#s105
Well I think I 've heard a lot uh about Coppell schools that they 're real good

#s107
that 's neat

#s109
Do you do you hope to have children

#s110
or are you not planning on having any

#s111
or

#s114
I see

#s115
Well do you have any pets

#s117
Oh yeah

#s119
Uh-huh

#s120
Well do they stay inside

#s121
or

#s124
Well that 's that 's neat

#s126
Yeah

#s127
Well what are the colors in your house

#s129
Oh I bet that 's pretty

#s133
Uh-huh

#s135
Oh that 's neat

#s136
I like cows too

#s138
Yeah

#s140
well our house was redo- uh

#s141
our house is very old also

#s143
it 's like thirty-seven years old

#s145
yeah

#s146
and it was redone before we moved in which

#s147
I 'm thankful for that

#s148
but the

#s149
it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in

#s151
everything is

#s153
like the carpet 's kind of a tan and brown and has um paneling in the living room and lots of lots of tans and lots of browns

#s156
but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that

#s159
you know so uh that 's worked out good

#s160
In the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan um wallpaper had done it up with blues

#s162
so that 's nice

#s163
but yeah

#s165
yeah

#s166
we 've enjoyed living here

#s167
It 's close to my uh oldest daughter 's school

#s169
and that makes it really handy too

#s172
and she really likes her school

#s173
so

#s175
and we are so close to shopping

#s176
and

#s178
Yeah

#s179
how about in Coppell

#s180
I 've always imagined it kind of out away from everything

#s182
Oh really

#s184
Oh well that 's nice

#s186
Oh wow

#s188
Oh

#s190
Yeah

#s191
yeah

#s193
but it does sound like it 's definitely growing

#s195
Yeah

#s198
Oh uh-huh

#s199
Uh-huh

#s201
Oh I see

#s202
Well when we first moved here we moved here from Lubbock

#s204
and we almost moved to Lewisville

#s205
that was our second choice yeah behind Garland

#s207
we at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
