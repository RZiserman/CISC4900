#s1
about the weather

#s5
Yeah

#s10
The weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual

#s11
I have n't expected it to be colder until you know

#s12
like we 've gotten the last couple of days

#s14
I do n't know

#s15
I fly for a living

#s16
and I 've uh

#s17
the weather 's been terribly unusual every where I 've been

#s19
Yeah

#s21
Yeah

#s23
Well it was around here last night

#s24
I 'll tell you that

#s26
No kidding

#s28
Um

#s31
Saturday or Sunday they were saying

#s32
yeah

#s34
Yeah

#s35
I know the systems have been real strong out

#s36
I went through uh Phoenix on twice on uh Wednesday morning

#s38
and uh MUMBLEx approaches to low minimum MUMBLEx both both times

#s40
and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather

#s41
so

#s43
Yes

#s44
I am

#s46
for Southwest

#s47
yeah

#s51
Oh is that right

#s54
Well now I would n't call it danger

#s55
This is uh this really is n't bad stuff to fly around in

#s56
This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime

#s60
the the air systems are reasonably calm

#s61
We do n't have uh the turbulence have a uh little bit of chop

#s63
but it 's not like it is in the spring time

#s67
Spectacular is the right word for them

#s69
Spectacular is a good word for them

#s71
It 's amazing

#s78
Oh yeah

#s79

#s80
Yeah
