Okay

#s2
what do you think about uh the self insurance business

#s4
Uh-huh

#s11
Well I uh I understand what you 're saying

#s12
and there 's probably some truth to that

#s13
I think that uh generally I do n't welcome added government responsibilities

#s14
However when a anybody ca n't police their own profession it eventually leads to that

#s15
and I think the costs and the uh the way the medical profession has every year

#s16
I being in my own business uh

#s17
in the last six years every year there 's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs

#s18
and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter

#s20
Uh I think they 're asking for it

#s21
I I think the medical profession is just just pushing until there 's no option but the government take it over

#s22
and uh

#s26
Well I I think a lot of it is uh

#s27
I I do n't disagree totally with that

#s28
but uh my wife this last summer uh when we were on vacation tore up her knee

#s29
and uh uh it was lig- ligaments uh in her knee as it turned out uh

#s31
she came back that uh

#s32
we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened

#s33
and uh she got home

#s34
and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come

#s35
I mean he knows knee problems okay

#s37
I mean if anyone does this guy knows it

#s38
Well she goes in

#s39
he says well I think this is what it is

#s40
but uh you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things

#s41
A thousand dollars for this uh oh magnetic uh resonance imaging type thing

#s42
And my wife said well do I need that

#s43
And he says well uh you know it it 'll help me diagnose this

#s44
I mean uh you know I I suggest you go have this thing

#s45
Insurance wo n't pick this up unless you 're in the hospital

#s46
Now a thousand uh uh dollars for thirty-five minutes

#s48
I mean doctors routinely send people in for anything

#s49
Now for years they did n't have this

#s50
and they solved these problems

#s51
and you know

#s53
I said to her well look you know

#s54
if you feel you got to go go

#s55
but I I think a thousand dollars

#s56
these guys

#s57
I do n't know what it is

#s58
but there 's no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day

#s60
And even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at uh roughly a thousand dollars every half hour uh that 's ridiculous

#s61
I I do n't care what anyone says

#s62
You know the costs are not

#s63
it 's a picture

#s64
It should n't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness

#s65
But they are n't reasonable

#s66
Fifty a hundred dollars

#s67
They do n't have to pay them back in three months time

#s71
You know

#s75
Well I think that should be that that 's a another problem

#s76
but that 's part of our legalese problem

#s77
And that the government eventually will address too just you know because it 's out of control

#s78
I I agree with you

#s79
You know uh I was on a jury

#s80
or I I did n't make the jury

#s81
but there was a deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant

#s83
Like it was three days after it was born

#s84
and he was the one that delivered it

#s85
And they got four attorneys

#s86
one guy out of Houston he introduced himself as snake so-and-so

#s87
and he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars

#s88
and I says yeah

#s89
I got problems with

#s90
I mean you know five million bucks is n't going to bring this kid back you know

#s91
I mean as sorrowful as it is

#s92
Uh you know if the doctor is wrong you know he should be pulled from his license

#s93
but five million dollars

#s94
and away he goes because insurance pays for it you know

#s95
it it does n't make logical sense to me

#s96
but uh

#s99
Uh that 's
