What kind of crime do you think uh is the most prevalent in our society

#s3
Such as New York City

#s8
Yeah

#s9
I I I wonder if uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because I mean so many people use it

#s10
and even though just using is not really

#s11
I mean it is a crime

#s16
Well that 's true

#s18
But I was I I was staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use

#s20
well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor

#s21
but uh what kind what kind

#s22
have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything

#s27
That that 's not that much

#s28
I mean you know those are n't

#s31
I

#s34
Yeah

#s35
I think it is

#s36
I in some ways it 's almost worse than murder

#s39
Uh

#s41
Murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to

#s42
you know I mean it is a rather final solution though

#s47
Yes

#s48
What what do you think is uh is an appropriate uh punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that

#s51
I agree with that

#s55
Yeah

#s56
I think Virginia does too up here

#s62
Yeah

#s63
I think the appeal process takes too long

#s66
I think I I think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year

#s71
Uh-huh

#s78
Well yeah

#s79
I mean the system is n't perfect

#s80
I mean it 's run by a bunch of imperfect humans

#s81
You do the best you can to make it perfect you know

#s82
you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect

#s84
But I think you have to accept some of the errors

#s85
I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment uh for murderers

#s90
And society probably too

#s92
I mean just general society to

#s95
Uh

#s96
Yeah

#s97
it does

#s98
and and it decreases the prison population And which is significant

#s101
I mean

#s102
Yeah

#s108
Yeah

#s109
generally the crimes of passion and things like that uh are not premeditated

#s111
I mean they can be

#s112
but usually they are n't

#s114
They 're spur of the moment

#s116
and uh the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those those individuals I think that you you end up with a uh uh how do I want to you end up with a s- you end up with someone who 's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time

#s120
Yes

#s121
they they would have no problems doing it again

#s124
Uh-huh

#s125
And I think locking them up for you know fifty years does n't do a any good because as a as a taxpayer I 'm going to pay you know one and a
