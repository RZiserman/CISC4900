Hello

#s6
Hi

#s7
my name is Pat Johnson

#s8
and I live in Te- Texas too

#s12
No

#s14
No

#s15
I live in Dallas

#s16
I work for the Dallas school system

#s19
We might as well

#s22
I understand we are doing care of the elderly right

#s24
And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home

#s27
Uh-huh

#s29
Yes

#s30
I would find it very difficult uh to uh place eit- my father or my step-mother uh in a place like that Particularly since I know how they feel about it

#s34
Yes

#s36
Yes

#s37
I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you are faced with placing someone In a place like that uh you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such

#s40
but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference

#s41
And I have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who you know could care for her

#s43
And uh I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about uh her situation

#s47
Uh-huh

#s49
Uh-huh

#s51
Yes

#s57
Uh-huh

#s61
Yeah

#s62
Uh-huh

#s64
Uh-huh

#s65
I think it would matter too uh kinds of uh disabilities that the nursing home accepts Because there are some uh who poor things you know do n't have uh any real grasp on reality any longer

#s68
And they may be ambulatory

#s69
but they tend to behave like children small children

#s71
and that would be very difficult I think for an adult who was n't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis

#s73
Uh

#s77
Yes

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
Yes

#s84
Yes

#s85
Alzheimer

#s86
yes

#s88
Yes

#s89
and that can
