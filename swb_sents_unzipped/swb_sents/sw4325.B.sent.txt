#s3
I guess I think uh I wonder if that worked

#s5
I think it usually does

#s6
You might try uh

#s7
I do n't know

#s8
hold it down a little longer

#s9
and see if it uh

#s12
Okay

#s13
I Well I do n't remember

#s14
It seemed like it did

#s15
but it might not

#s16
I guess I guess we can start

#s17
Uh

#s20
No

#s21
I do n't I do n't have any kids

#s22
I uh my sister has a she just had a baby

#s23
he 's about five months old

#s24
and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different

#s26
do you have kids

#s28
Oh really

#s35
Uh-huh

#s38
Yeah

#s40
Uh yeah

#s41
she lives

#s42
it 's a it 's a fairly large community

#s43
She uh got real lucky though

#s44
He had a boss who uh moved into a larger office

#s46
and she 's able to take her baby to work with her

#s48
And it 's a small office that she works in

#s50
and uh it 's a it 's a legal firm office

#s51
and it 's just one lawyer

#s53
and so she 's the only one really that takes care of the office

#s54
There 's no one else that works there

#s56
And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby

#s57
so it works out pretty good for her

#s61
Yeah

#s65
Yeah

#s66
so it 's fairly safe

#s71
Worried that they 're not going to get enough attention

#s74
Yeah

#s77
Yes

#s81
Yeah

#s82
and you and you do n't always even know if it 's it 's going to be the right place or not

#s84
Anything I guess could happen

#s86
Because after I guess after he you know gets to a certain age she 's going to have to take him to a day care

#s89
Yeah

#s91
When when he 's not when she ca n't keep control of him

#s92
and he starts crawling

#s93
that 's

#s98
Uh-huh

#s103
Yeah

#s105
I think she has problems with that too

#s109
I do n't know

#s110
that 's something I 've considered

#s111
Uh

#s113
I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time

#s115
Is that what you do

#s119
Oh so they do n't go to school

#s120
Is it like uh

#s121
oh what 's that called

#s122
it 's uh correspondence school

#s123
they do it at home

#s127
That 's interesting

#s129
Do you have to have any special training

#s139
So they have n't been to public schools at all

#s143
Um

#s146
So you 've never had
