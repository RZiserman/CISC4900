#s1
I uh spent four years as a university professor

#s3
And

#s4
Yeah

#s7
Oh do you really

#s9
That 's great

#s12
No kidding

#s13
W-

#s14
I did

#s16
I did uh

#s18
Well I was pretty young

#s19
I was uh

#s20
I had never intended to do it

#s21
and I was uh uh given the opportunity after I 'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system

#s23
At any rate uh the topic is fascinating because one of the things I 've done for the past few years is uh research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically

#s25
You may be familiar with cooperative learning

#s26
Have you ever

#s28
Well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools

#s29
And uh what what it involves basically is the use of peer groups

#s30
and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives I guess they 're called

#s32
And there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh gain a competence with respect to the material

#s34
Uh I think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn

#s35
Uh I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster

#s36
Uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators

#s39
and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results

#s40
So my feeling is that uh the the problem is is uh significant There are plenty of good people uh available to uh offer people educational experience but that we just have to re- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it

#s41
and uh I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research uh uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning

#s43
And my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually

#s44
I do n't know what form it will ultimately take

#s45
Uh uh but I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for uh inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior

#s46
so it must be the way we 're managing the process that uh

#s51
I I do n't I do n't think it 's it 's a matter of of uh talented people to do it a- both as quote unquote students and as teachers

#s52
but clearly what 's happened in this country is the school system 's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that were n't existent uh

#s55
you must see kids with real significant problems uh in some cases

#s56
Uh course I always see the

#s57
I do n't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City

#s58
Is it is it uh deteriorated a lot

#s59
Do the people say

#s60
are they pretty happy with it

#s61
or

#s65
Right

#s66
Even in Utah

#s69
Well Utah 's a place where you would n't think that problem would be very severe

#s72
Yeah

#s73
you so you saw a fair number of troubled kids

#s77
Yeah

#s78
Yeah
