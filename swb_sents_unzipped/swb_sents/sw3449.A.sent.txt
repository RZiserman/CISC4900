#s2
I have n't uh talked to anybody outside the Metroplex

#s3
so I did n't even think of saying Arlington Texas

#s4
This is a real first

#s6
Are you at work

#s9
I I I 've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening

#s10
and I thought well I 'm not having any luck

#s11
I 'll try the middle of the afternoon

#s13
I am too

#s14
Well do you have any uh opinion on the subject

#s17
Democracy

#s18
Oh

#s20
Oh sure

#s21
we uh we hear a little of the news

#s22
Uh yeah

#s23
I have heard about that the last couple of days

#s24
How how big is the Ukraine the area

#s25
do you know

#s27
Or a population or anything

#s28
I 'm really uninformed

#s30
Uh-huh

#s34
Uh-huh

#s35
uh-huh

#s37
Oh I see

#s38
oh I I did n't really know that

#s39
I know a lot of their oh their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right

#s41
And uh what about Astonia

#s42
are they

#s44
Right

#s45
I thought they were

#s48
But but the the Ukraine is especially significant because it of the agriculture

#s51
Uh so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could

#s54
No

#s55
they do n't

#s57
And Bush has already given his opinion on it right

#s59
Did n't I read that

#s61
So now uh not that they may that may matter

#s62
I do n't know anymore

#s63
I uh fear for the Russians from what I read you know

#s64
I wonder how they 're going to get through the winter Food wise or any wise

#s66
sounds to me like they 'll start rioting soon or not that that would do any good

#s67
but I guess people do that when they 're desperate

#s71
Well that 's true

#s72
since the Depression I guess when the veterans went to Washington

#s74
and well you know the war riots of course

#s75
Let 's just hope we do n't get to that point

#s76
Things are not so good in Texas job wise

#s79
Well we do

#s80
We have lots and lots of uh layoffs here Lot of companies folding lot of layoffs

#s81
and it 's pretty scary

#s83
Well I do n't understand economics that well

#s84
I do n't know

#s85
I I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we do n't

#s87
and so I assume that that has some effect Or a great effect

#s90
And I do uh I mean they said during the way Reagan-Bush years the rich got richer

#s91
the poor got poorer

#s92
the statistics prove that

#s93
so uh I I guess

#s96
Well I really do n't know

#s97
I think maybe they uh maybe they contributed to it

#s98
Maybe they should pay more attention to these trade or you know to the more equalization of the trade

#s100
Of course if somebody in in China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well I do n't know what 's going to happen then

#s102
Right

#s104
And child labor

#s106
Right

#s107
Well I do n't know

#s108
What do you think has caused our horrible situation

#s110
One thing

#s112
Right

#s113
well they say too that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good

#s114
I mean I 've read that is a theory

#s116
Well I hate to say it

#s117
but I I 'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party

#s119
Uh

#s121
Oh I know

#s122
it used to

#s123
right

#s124
Well you do n't want too many democrats anymore

#s125
and for a while I kind of deserted the party

#s126
but now it 's looking better to me

#s128
Oh do you

#s129
Oh I 'm glad to hear that

#s131
Well I think so too

#s132
I I just admire her a lot

#s134
And uh I ho- I really hope she does well

#s135
But she 's uh n- you know probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win

#s137
But look who she was running against you know

#s140
He shot himself in the foot so many times

#s141
How did you get on this T I thing
