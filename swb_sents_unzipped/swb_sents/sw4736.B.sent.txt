Uh yeah

#s4
That 's that 's as far back as I can remember

#s5
Well that 's before my time actually

#s9
Uh-huh

#s17
Uh-huh

#s19
Well I think that currently the way the law stands is n't so much that the laws are enforceable or not

#s20
it 's more they 're not enforcing the death penalty itself

#s21
It 's at that point where they 're saying like here you 're you 're going on death row

#s22
but you 'll stay there for twenty years

#s24
And nothing is being done about it

#s25
Uh the laws exist and MUMBLEx are frequently upheld in in uh in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find

#s26
And it 's it 's really getting out of hand MUMBLEx in many states

#s49
Well it seems like well it it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished

#s50
and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually did n't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off

#s51
Um for instance um there 's a case a few years back where uh someone uh someone who 's being convicted for was under a tri- was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that The of- the arresting officer uh did not read the defendant their rights

#s52
Uh-huh

#s53
And where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
