Why do n't you start

#s6
Things you already owned or things that you 've picked up just to do that

#s8
Are they things you already owned

#s9
or you pick them up just to do that refinishing

#s12
Yeah

#s13
I 've done both

#s15
Uh uh my wife has picked up a couple of things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture

#s16
and uh we 've done it a couple of times

#s17
I guess that we 've been fairly successful with those

#s19
That 's uh that 's a kind of low risk sort of project is n't it I guess

#s22
Uh I have a a uh really nice desk A nicer desk than I could afford Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire

#s24
and uh we stripped it all the way down and refinished it

#s25
and it turned out to be really nice uh a nice desk

#s26
Maple top I think or or something of that sort

#s31
Oh really

#s33
Oh I 'm jealous

#s37
Uh-huh

#s38
Yeah

#s39
I I do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking

#s40
I 've built my own deck and uh things like that

#s44
And uh I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too

#s45
My I uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife 's father owned when he was alive

#s47
and so I do have a band saw and a router and uh things like that out in the garage

#s48
But I ca n't say I use them very often

#s51
They 're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times

#s53
Putting doors in is the time when I 'm

#s54
uh I bought myself a uh template for making mortices and doors

#s55
and that 's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel

#s57
But I 've also I 've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain

#s59
So I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it

#s60
and now I use it twice a year maybe

#s64
The big

#s67
Uh I guess it

#s70
The ones that what

#s72
Uh I have never even s- I have never even looked at one closely

#s73
Uh the the little use that I 've gotten from my router I would say uh I would spend my money on the bits

#s76
Uh I have a I 'd guess you 'd call a medium quality Craftsman router

#s77
and the uh

#s79
It 's strong enough for any job where you do n't try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time

#s80
But the problem is that the uh as with

#s81
any any time you buy a a tool with a a as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end

#s85
So the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably uh I mean a a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars

#s86
and uh uh if you 're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it 's worth it

#s87
Because e- uh

#s88
I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself uh they wo n't last

#s89
And I 've never had the bits sharpened

#s90
So That 's a thing to consider is to

#s93
Yeah

#s94
And they they dull after awhile

#s95
Especially I did some cabinets in uh ash and oak

#s97
and uh that that wears a bit down

#s98
We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen

#s101
And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth

#s102
And uh routing hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast

#s103
So

#s107
Right

#s108
That 's uh

#s110
And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right

#s112
Uh-huh

#s114
Right

#s116
Yeah

#s117
Well I 've used mine on treated wood

#s118
and now all my blades need sharpening Because uh treated wood will also chew them up
