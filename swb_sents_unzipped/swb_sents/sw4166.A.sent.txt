Okay

#s2
Uh before a couple of years ago I had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes

#s3
and it was uh more like a funeral home

#s4
I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home

#s5
And uh then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas

#s6
and I went to one

#s7
and it just had a very good activities director

#s8
Everyone was cheerful

#s9
and now I do n't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore

#s10
But I I certainly would n't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re- resort

#s11
Uh I have a sister that is in nursing school

#s12
and she 's real interested in geriatrics

#s14
Yeah

#s15
So uh she she 's real interested in uh what Ann Richards has been doing

#s16
She 's Ann Richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes

#s17
and I do n't know you would n't know anything about a Texas governor

#s20
Okay

#s21
Ann Richards is our governor in Texas

#s22
and she 's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes

#s23
And uh my sister 's real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing

#s27
Right

#s29
Uh-huh

#s31
Uh-huh

#s35
Oh

#s38
Uh-huh

#s40
Right

#s42
Right

#s44
Uh-huh

#s46
Right

#s48
Right

#s50
Right

#s52
Uh-huh

#s53
It sure is

#s54
And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive Because cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older

#s60
Oh yeah

#s61
Right

#s62
My grandfather passed away several years ago

#s63
I was much younger

#s64
But uh he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life

#s65
and someone visited him every day

#s66
My grandmother did

#s67
But uh if she could n't someone visited him every day

#s68
It was in a very small town nursing home

#s70
And uh people did n't get paid much there at all

#s71
They did n't care about what went on

#s73
They would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores

#s75
And uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that would n't get met because they were just old people

#s76
And then the nurses and doctors really did n't put any for forth any loving care for them

#s78
Right

#s79
Right

#s83
Uh-huh

#s84
Right

#s85
Right

#s86
And nurses get so worn down

#s90
Right

#s91
Oh sure

#s92
And they feel they feel pretty helpless

#s95
Is it uh like a retirement center

#s98
Uh-huh

#s100
Uh-huh

#s102
Uh-huh

#s104
How 's he handling that

#s106
Uh-huh

#s109
