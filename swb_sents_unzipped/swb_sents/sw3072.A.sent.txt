Okay

#s3
where have you all been on vacation recently

#s7
Detroit

#s9
Is that a nice vacation spot

#s12
Right

#s13
okay

#s15
Right

#s16
So you probably would n't recommend that as a big tourist spot

#s19
Ooh that would be nice

#s21
Did you scuba dive there

#s24
Ooh that would be nice

#s27
Oh that would be enjoyable

#s28
Right

#s29
yeah

#s30
that 's a nice break

#s32
I have n't been on vacation in a while either

#s33
Um usually when we go we go to Colorado to Estes Park area Which is up kind of near Denver And uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the Texas heat that kind of thing

#s37
So it 's a lot of fun

#s38
I worked up there last summer

#s39
so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long

#s42
Worked at a camp there

#s43
and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains

#s44
So that 's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation

#s47
Oh

#s51
That 's nice

#s52
We um we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River

#s55
And that 's the best place that I 've ever canoed

#s57
It 's really really pretty

#s58
I was a little kid then

#s59
and we to have uh

#s60
we stayed at some park

#s61
and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night

#s62
and he would give a little talk about mountain things

#s63
You know I think he was n't a real mountain man

#s64
but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in the woods that he 'd come in his little log boat down the river

#s67
and we would have to we 'd

#s68
and he 'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he 'd found

#s69
and That 's a good family place to go

#s72
and then the river was really nice because it was n't too frightening

#s73
but it was n't you know too easy either

#s75
It was like

#s78
That 's true

#s80
Uh-huh

#s81
Right

#s83
Yeah

#s85
Well that 's good

#s86
Well we um

#s87
let 's see

#s88
the only other place I 've ever vacationed we 'd you know go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that

#s90
And then I went to England a few years ago

#s92
I was a student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in London

#s95
And that was a great time because it 's so that 's such a neat place

#s96
and it 's there 's not a language barrier

#s97
so you do n't

#s98
I mean there there 's a little bit because there 's some of those English words that you just do n't exactly know what they mean

#s99
and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents

#s100
but it 's it was really fun

#s101
I I I really enjoyed that

#s102
I 'm probably going back there to work for a year

#s108
It it 's really nice

#s109
I would I would spend all my time in London or most of my time

#s111
and that 's it was really different being in a big city

#s112
because I do n't get much into urban you know really urban areas a lot

#s115
and it was it 's really it 's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are

#s116
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which I thought I would just hate

#s117
but it ended up being kind of nice because you 're not accountable to anyone

#s120
You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe

#s123
I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people

#s125
And I had a great time doing that

#s126
It was really interesting

#s129
Yeah

#s130
I know

#s132
I keep wanting to get up to

#s133
I have n't I have n't been anywhere else outside the United States

#s134
I have n't been to Mexico or Canada or

#s136
Oh

#s139
Yeah

#s140
that would be nice

#s141
I had a friend from there

#s143
Then I I 'd love to go somewhere in Asia

#s144
but I 'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that

#s149
So yeah

#s150
that 's why that 's why England was nice

#s151
Even we traveled in Europe for about a week

#s152
and that was even nice because there was n't uh the

#s153
most the places we went we went to Germany and Switzerland and

#s155
Yeah

#s156
we have

#s157
We MUMBLEx We did we whirlwinded through Europe

#s160
It was just insane

#s161
twelve days where we 'd just stop like a city a day

#s162
and you slept on the train at night

#s164
But there was n't a

#s165
it was strange

#s166
it was kind of sad

#s167
there was n't ever a language problem there because everyone in Germany knew English

#s168
and everyone in Switzerland knew English

#s171
So we were kind of pitiful

#s172
We found one restaurant we were in and got seated

#s173
and then no one knew English in there

#s174
and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things

#s176
But it was

#s178
Oh I had fondue

#s179
That was easy to say

#s181
Tried to get fondue and white wine

#s182
and that was

#s184
we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly

#s185
There were some people at the next table who spoke English

#s186
so we elicited their aid for a while

#s188
and they were very helpful

#s190
so It was it was a pleasant time

#s192
I 'd I 'd love to go back there

#s193
There 's just not time

#s194
There 's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything

#s196
Right

#s197
That 's

#s200
That and sleeping late

#s202
I keep hoping for

#s204
Well it was nice talking with you

#s207
And have a good afternoon

#s209
Okay

#s211
Good-bye
