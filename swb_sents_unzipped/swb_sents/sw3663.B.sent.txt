Okay

#s3
Well considering you moved here from California I guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there

#s11
Especially the last few years

#s14
It 's kind of it 's kind of been a drought out there has n't it uh

#s19
Yet

#s24
Generally if we 're going to get them it 's not going to happen uh prior to January one

#s26
You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we 've been getting in December

#s27
but usually the bitterest weather if we 're going to have any comes in January and February

#s30
Then by March things are getting warm again

#s31
so we really do n't have as long a cold season I guess as people up north

#s35
It 's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before

#s37
Lots of times

#s39
No

#s40
it 's nice

#s41
I just came in from outside

#s43
and it 's it 's really pretty

#s44
It 's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again

#s47
I 'm a I 'm a scoutmaster

#s48
and so I wind up going out camping with uh a bunch of boys at one time

#s49
and so it 's better for us if it has n't been this totally wet before we go

#s53
Oh yeah

#s55
Yeah

#s56
we camp year round

#s59
But uh It 's uh it 's definitely different

#s61
And then I guess you 've been through a couple of summers here too right

#s68
Oh it is

#s69
It 's not as humid As Houston say or Atlanta

#s70
but it But more humid than Arizona

#s73
and California for the most part

#s75
Were you northern California

#s77
Central

#s79
So that was Dry but pretty even climate was n't it

#s80
Year round fairly Not wide fluctuations

#s87
But it 's a drier

#s89
Hundred when you have a hundred here everybody 's dying

#s94
Oh

#s97
What types of What type what type of business takes you to those climates

#s98
or was that just vacation or something

#s101
Oh

#s103
Not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages

#s108
Oh

#s110
That 's interesting

#s112
You do n't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing

#s117
So you 're you 're with the home office now

#s122
Well the uh I think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh

#s123
the weather you know does change fast

#s125
and things do happen severely a few times a year

#s126
but there 's an awful lot of good weather too in between

#s131
Yeah

#s132
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too After the last freeze

#s134
and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh I like that Particularly if I 'm going to be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things

#s138
And that 's nicer

#s141
Yeah

#s142
I do quite a bit of that

#s144
Think we 're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas

#s145
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here

#s146
so I guess we 'll

#s148
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains

#s150
There 's not much between us and the North Pole

#s152
And then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms

#s154
and then
