MUMBLEx How big is Provo

#s3
That a little town or or a bigger city

#s9
Oh

#s10
I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town I think

#s13
Yeah

#s14
I forgot the name of the town

#s15
I thought maybe it was you

#s16
Oh well anyway we 're supposed to talk about education

#s17
I certainly have some ideas since I 'm studying it now in college

#s18
I 'd say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic in grade school

#s20
because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to

#s21
and it shows up

#s22
That 's one idea

#s23
Do you have any

#s27
Uh-huh

#s30
Yeah

#s31
it 's

#s32
Plano uh improved greatly in the last twenty twenty-five years

#s34
that 's for sure

#s35
It used to be the pits

#s36
And Arlington is excellent now

#s37
but I 'm just speaking overall across the country

#s40
Something is definitely wrong

#s42
And uh one thing they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing

#s43
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year

#s44
and they truly ca n't read

#s46
so I do n't know how they expect them to uh pass history when they ca n't read anything you know even read a word problem in math

#s47
So um that 's definitely a problem

#s48
Another problem is you 're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do

#s50
But um

#s52
That is good about

#s53
well it depends on where you are

#s54
They 're all so different

#s55
That 's another thing about the United States

#s57
There 's no national curriculum you know

#s58
I mean what they 'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school

#s60
and in the same school district you may even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance you may have an English class

#s61
you may have half literature for the whole year

#s62
whereas in another one they 're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature

#s64
it 's up to the teacher in other words

#s65
So that 's kind of o- you know that 's kind of odd to me

#s67
It depends on uh what school you 're in and who your teacher is actually

#s69
or is how you end up

#s70
Overall Arlington is good one of the better ones in the state

#s71
so I guess we lucked out when we moved here

#s75
Uh-huh

#s76
Of course we have a slight problem in that uh the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point

#s77
and uh you know where our kids might be in a great school we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read you know

#s79
So

#s81
I do n't know

#s82
I just read about that the other day

#s83
and I had never even thought of it

#s84
Actually it makes sense to a certain extent

#s85
because sometimes like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that did n't even learn what uh they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach you know MUMBLEx and according to her plan

#s87
so I guess if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn

#s89
But uh We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes you know

#s91
That 's that 's pretty low that there 's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more peop- more citizens percentage wise that can read and write

#s93
so um unless we want to keep paying paying for these people that ca n't make it in society we 're going to have to do something

#s96
I do n't know

#s97
Obviously nobody 's smart enough to have figured it out yet

#s98
so I probably ca n't

#s99
But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write

#s100
because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know

#s102
Uh you ca n't you ca n't even work an answering machine if you 're at work and had to get a message or something you know or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you ca n't read

#s104
So uh I think that 's that 's a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades

#s107
and um they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago

#s108
and that 's a big jump

#s110
Did you go to school in Plano

#s112
Through high school
