Okay

#s7
um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old

#s8
and um uh my husband let 's see he coaches basketball with Brian

#s9
um

#s11
so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing outside

#s13
Um he 's a real sports kind of person

#s14
so he plays tennis with with the kids

#s15
We all kind of play tennis as a family

#s16
except the baby plays in the playground

#s18
We take turns with her

#s19
Um uh let 's see

#s20
we have a computer

#s21
and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer

#s22
Um uh let 's what else we do

#s23
Oh plus we watch a little T V together

#s24
We really do n't watch I think as much T V as a lot of people

#s26
We do n't have H B O

#s27
We do get the Disney channel for the kids

#s29
Uh my kids have a Nintendo which they play

#s30
and my husband sometimes joins them with that

#s32
Uh my little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things

#s33
and I 'll take some time and do that with her

#s34
And of course we always read a bedtime story at night

#s35
and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story

#s36
I 'm basically the story person because my husband does n't have

#s38
he gets home from work late or whatever

#s39
and and usually once in a while he 'll read the story to little one

#s40
but that 's basically my job

#s42
Um

#s45
It is

#s46
It is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself

#s49
and and it

#s50
and that 's kind of cutting into your your time

#s52
And with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late

#s54
but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine

#s55
They go upstairs at nine

#s56
and um now this weekend we 'll have a baby-sitter come

#s57
and uh my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late

#s59
Maybe Brian will still be up

#s60
and spend some time with him

#s61
But it it 's really hard

#s62
You have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids I think

#s66
Uh no

#s67
I do n't work

#s68
I last year um I had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities

#s70
That was two days a week

#s71
and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot

#s72
I do n't know how

#s73
I admire people that that can do it all

#s75
but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way I want it kept it is hard

#s78
Um

#s80
Even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything

#s82
And that 's another thing

#s83
I 'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend

#s84
and that 's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son

#s85
and they 'll be my helper

#s86
and then they 'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out

#s87
so I try to do things like that

#s89
but it you know it 's it 's uh

#s91
And then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too

#s93
You fit it in with all that that

#s96
I I think a lot of people a lot of people s- set their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies and and kind of leave them to their own means

#s97
Um

#s100
I think you know it 's very very easy to fall into that trap

#s101
and I 'm not um totally innocent of that because there 's times when you just stay here watch a tape

#s104
But um um I think different parts of the country

#s105
I think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas there 's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids

#s106
People are real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and

#s109
You know but um

#s114
What

#s117
Uh-huh

#s119
Uh-huh

#s120
And it 's it 's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it 's very hard to to cut back to one

#s122
And um um but you know if you have the type of job

#s123
I have a friend that 's a nurse

#s124
and she can pick her hours

#s125
and

#s127
that 's a a great career

#s128
I wish I would have gone into uh nursing

#s130
because she has such a flexible schedule

#s131
but it 's very hard to uh spend time with the children and uh and your husband and do everything at once

#s135
Well I think it 's a big it 's a big um responsibility

#s136
You just do n't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single

#s139
When you have children you have to say now this is different

#s140
and you do have to give things up

#s141
I I personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um for the at least for the first two years of their lives I mean if you can possibly swing it

#s144
because they
