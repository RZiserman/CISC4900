Okay Bill

#s2
right

#s4
Okay Bill

#s5
have you done much camping

#s8
Uh-huh

#s11
Oh well that that sounds good

#s13
Yeah

#s14
you do

#s15
Um now do you have a lot mountains

#s16
well you do n't have mountains in Texas do you

#s17
Where do you find places to camp

#s19
Oh

#s21
Uh-huh

#s23
Oh

#s24
Oh my word

#s25
Well that sounds adventuresome

#s27
Well um I 've done oh I would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and I

#s28
Um we have five children

#s29
and so we have found that camping with the little ones is n't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves

#s30
So we 've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out

#s31
and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it

#s32
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains

#s34
And then the boys are our boys are old enough now

#s35
they 're twelve and eleven

#s36
and so they 're involved in the scouting

#s37
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts

#s39
and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week

#s40
and so this year they 'll both be going

#s41
and so that 's been real enjoyable for them

#s43
So

#s47
Um yes

#s48
they 've well

#s49
no

#s50
actually they 've I remember they have taken the the du- the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire

#s51
and I do n't think they 've taken the stoves

#s52
Um last year they camped in tents

#s53
and this year I believe they will be in tents also

#s56
Uh-huh

#s57
yeah

#s60
Oh is that right

#s62
Oh and what does that consist of

#s64
Oh

#s65
Uh-huh

#s71
Uh-huh

#s74
Oh

#s75
Yes

#s76
well see when when we go camping here

#s77
we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents

#s78
and I like to sleep on the air matresses

#s79
I 'm not

#s80
my bones are getting so old

#s81
so I like to I like to sleep on the matresses

#s83
Um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that

#s88
Oh

#s89
My word

#s90
Gee

#s95
Uh-huh

#s97

#s104
Uh they 're covered like with a heavy armor type stuff

#s105
Uh-huh

#s106
uh-huh

#s108
My word

#s110
Uh-huh

#s112
But they wo n't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything

#s114
Oh

#s116
Uh-huh

#s117
Uh-huh

#s119
