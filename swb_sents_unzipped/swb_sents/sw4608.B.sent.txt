#s3
Well um Minneapolis is n't too bad

#s4
Uh I know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders

#s6
Uh that 's kind of gone up in scale and and some other things

#s7
Uh I personally had a little experience the other day

#s8
Uh somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck

#s10
But actually you know when you look at at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it 's really quite a bit better Uh because I came from Florida

#s12
and in Orlando there 's crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever

#s13
so

#s15
What part of California are you from

#s17
Oh really

#s18
I have a good friend there

#s20
Yeah MUMBLEx

#s26
Oh yeah

#s27
Uh-huh

#s30
Yeah

#s31
Yeah

#s32
that 's

#s36
That 's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like

#s39
Sure

#s42
Well uh interestingly enough right before I moved up here

#s43
I 'm an intern

#s44
and then I go back down in May

#s46
Uh but in Orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it

#s47
Uh we 've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks

#s49
And one of the things that I I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there

#s51
Uh because they were just

#s52
it 's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know

#s54
and then the houses were left unguarded

#s55
uh but yeah

#s56
I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that 's a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch

#s59
Oh is that right

#s62
Oh

#s67
That 's amazing

#s69
Yeah

#s71
Uh

#s72
Yeah

#s73
it almost seems like they 're getting quite a bit smarter

#s75
Really you know

#s77
Yeah

#s78
unfortunately it 's starting to really you know look at people 's habits and where they are at particular points of the day

#s81
Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he 's from Detroit

#s83
and uh the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced

#s84
uh

#s86
but uh yeah

#s87
I guess

#s89
I think we 've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis

#s90
I 'm not real sure

#s91
Uh

#s99
Pretty much

#s101
Yeah

#s102
I was I was basically involved in that in the organization of it

#s104
And then I left right in the middle of it

#s105
I 'm not sure where we went from there

#s107
but

#s110
Yeah

#s111
that that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that

#s112
sure

#s117
Yeah

#s118
Yeah

#s120
Yeah

#s121
One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited

#s123
even even if you know that the threat is there it 's against the law to set traps

#s125
it 's against the law to do a lot of things you know

#s126
They could basically uh

#s127
when I was getting robbed down in Florida I was really considering electrifying doors um things like that like

#s131
they did in Miami that time

#s134
That 's not always true

#s136
No

#s137
There was a there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed

#s139
and essentially what he had done is set a a elec- a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home

#s142
The guy came in while he was home

#s143
and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned

#s144
He did n't die

#s145
but he was severely burned

#s146
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement

#s148
Yeah

#s149
So that really that makes you think you know

#s151
It 's like your hands are re- very much tied
