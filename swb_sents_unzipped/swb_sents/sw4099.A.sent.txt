Kay

#s3
I guess we 're talking about exercise huh

#s7
Oh I am twenty-seven

#s14
You do

#s15
What type of exercise do you do

#s17
Oh you do

#s19
Yes

#s23
Are they different from aerobics

#s24
or is it the same thing

#s30
And you do that every day

#s31
or

#s34
Oh okay

#s36
And this is a club

#s37
or uh do you belong to a group

#s44
Do you go with friends

#s45
or do you go alone

#s49
Yeah

#s52
Uh-huh

#s55
Uh-huh

#s57
Oh

#s59
Oh yeah

#s60
young mothers or

#s63
Uh-huh

#s65
Uh I really do n't have a routine

#s66
I like playing basketball

#s67
We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop

#s68
and that 's what I do every day

#s72
Yeah

#s73
pretty much

#s74
When my wife lets me

#s78
No

#s79
I just shoot around by myself

#s81
And uh that 's about it

#s82
I use to play soccer a lot in high school

#s83
but when I graduated I have n't done much

#s84
I do n't have a problem

#s85
I know I have to do more aerobics

#s86
but I do n't have a problem with weight

#s87
I could eat all day and not gain an ounce

#s90
Uh-huh

#s93
You do exercise

#s96
You do it

#s98
Uh-huh

#s101
Yeah

#s102
and I

#s104
well everyone 's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days

#s105
but I do n't know

#s111
Uh-huh

#s112
Yeah

#s113
I guess I enjoy sports a lot

#s114
so that 's why I 've kept active in that way

#s117
Uh basketball

#s118
volleyball uh

#s119
too bad it 's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby

#s120
I do that

#s123
Uh I use to

#s124
but it got too expensive

#s125
so

#s127
Yeah

#s129
Yeah

#s130
a lot of people do that

#s132
and but well I just I never find the time

#s133
I had rather do other things

#s138
Oh they come up here

#s144
That 's in Nevada

#s145
Uh-huh

#s148
Oh yeah

#s149
but

#s151
There 's Snow Bird or Alta

#s154
Heavenly

#s157
Huh I 've never heard of that one

#s159
Huh-uh

#s164
Do they exercise much or I mean for skiing

#s165
I know when I went you can get sore easily

#s166
but

#s172
Oh yeah

#s173
MUMBLEx is one or two timer a year if I do go on them

#s174

#s176

#s178

#s181
But that 's

#s182
