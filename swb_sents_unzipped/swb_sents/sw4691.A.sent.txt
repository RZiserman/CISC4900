#s2
Okay

#s3
I 'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so

#s8
Oh yeah

#s9
Right Well

#s11
Really

#s13
Why

#s16
Uh-huh

#s21
Yeah

#s22
Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you

#s25
Uh-huh

#s27
Right

#s29
Well it depends on where you 're from in Texas

#s30
I live right by Dallas

#s31
so we have one football team as far as we 're concerned

#s34
That 's how it is

#s36
It 's divided

#s37
yeah

#s39
It really is

#s40
so we 've got our Cowboys here

#s41
and and uh I do n't think anybody roots differently

#s43
but I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno

#s45
and he is for the L the uh Raiders L A Raiders

#s47
so

#s49
Well I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that did n't do very well

#s50
but I 've been trying more this year

#s51
I think I know a little more than I use to

#s53
I never knew very much at all

#s54
so I 'm trying

#s56
Yeah

#s63
So I should n't even try to do it huh

#s66
Yes

#s69
Right

#s73
Yeah

#s79
Really

#s81
I do n't even think we have that in Texas

#s83
We might

#s84
Do we

#s85
I mean no

#s86
you probably know

#s87
I do n't know

#s91
Nobody talks about it

#s92
so I do n't think we do

#s94
No

#s95
uh-huh

#s96
And we have a soccer team that comes and goes

#s97
We do n't even have that very much

#s98
so

#s101
Uh-huh

#s105
Yeah

#s111
Oh

#s115
Oh yeah

#s117
Yeah

#s118
Well I like to do

#s119
I do n't like to watch

#s122
I do n't like to watch anything

#s123
So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff

#s124
I think it 's an excuse to do nothing

#s125
and I I can see what you 're saying about the male bonding

#s126
and the guys get together

#s128
and that 's kind of cool

#s129
That 's fun you know

#s131
But it can get really overdone

#s133
Yeah

#s134
I have

#s136
Yeah

#s137
yeah

#s138
I have

#s140
Uh no

#s141
actually no

#s144
I 've done that for college football

#s147
Yeah

#s150
Yeah

#s156
Right

#s157
And that 's the thing you know

#s162
Yeah

#s167
Yeah

#s169
That 's right

#s171
Yeah

#s172
that 's right

#s174
Uh-huh

#s176
Yeah

#s177
Well in high school I went to every football game

#s178
and well I twirled you know

#s180
And I you know I did n't

#s181
I still do n't know that much about football obviously

#s182
But I still had a good time You know
