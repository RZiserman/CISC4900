#s1
Uh I guess I 've always kind of liked golf

#s2
I I worked on a golf course at at one time

#s3
and that 's how I picked up golf

#s4
And uh I do n't know

#s5
it 's just a kind of a challenging game

#s8
Uh-huh

#s10
I have n't gotten the chance lately though to play

#s11
I 'm trying to get back into it

#s12
Uh so uh I got to start all over again

#s13
It 's not like riding a bicycle

#s14
You do tend to forget

#s17
Oh

#s18
Yeah

#s20
What is your handicap

#s22
Okay

#s23
Uh I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago

#s24
It 's probably up there to twenty now if I MUMBLEx to start again

#s26
Yeah

#s27
Yeah

#s28
I have got to try and get out there

#s29
I I know with our our long winters I I enjoy watching it

#s30
I do n't know if it 's just because I like the game or I just like to to see the warm weather

#s33
Uh-huh

#s37
Yeah

#s38
that 's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter

#s39
you almost have to relearn every spring to to get back out

#s43
Yeah

#s50
Uh-huh

#s52
Right

#s53
Yeah

#s54
you always work on trying to improve each day

#s55
and

#s62
Yeah

#s63
Yeah

#s64
I know what you mean

#s65
I when I used to golf out there I 'd putt well

#s66
but I I would n't uh chip well

#s67
One of the two uh

#s68
or something would go wrong

#s69
but I always managed to to get near par anyway

#s71
Oh

#s74
Uh-huh

#s77
Yeah

#s81
Uh-huh

#s82
Do you have uh long waits uh to get on the course

#s86
Yeah

#s89
Yeah

#s90
Okay

#s91
I just moved into this small community

#s92
so I 'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here

#s93
I 'm hoping that wo n't be cou-

#s94
I was from the uh twin cities area

#s96
Yeah

#s97
Are you sure you guys are n't having the bad weather

#s99
Yeah

#s101
Well I wish that 's all we had

#s105
Oh

#s108
Yeah

#s114
I see

#s115
Well at least it that does n't uh get in the way of golfing

#s116
so that

#s120
Yeah

#s121
Yeah

#s122
that 's what they do here sometimes

#s123
You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there

#s124
but if you got
