I do n't know

#s48
being a being the bachelor here that I am I I do n't think I 'd I 'd be a- b-

#s49
I mean it it 's not a question of capability here to do something like that

#s50
It 's just there 's there 's no motivation

#s52
You know I want to I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that

#s53

#s77
and then during the summertime it 's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors

#s79
like that 's a little more a casual thing

#s80
But in mine the wintertime it 's not bad too because then I 've got a a fireplace and a nice nice house and all that

a really good place to do entertaining like that
